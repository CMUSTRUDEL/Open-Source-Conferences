	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
there is a project called dis Nick's

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,550
which is used to distribute one

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,730
configuration of our networking a tune

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,240
so you can define with the configuration

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,539
file always a server interact but some

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,320
dubs shall come soon to destroy this

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,119
project then you have the Machine

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,800
deployment which normally probably the

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,660
same goes for the same areas conflict

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,039
management we get machines which i

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,859
donated knobbly so those different some

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,530
data center we don't know often then

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,930
somebody puts a sentiment on there and

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,190
then we do the stuff we do I think might

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,079
be different than other people how

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,309
distributions I know I'm not sure about

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,320
that I think that we probably will gets

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,789
all the old stuff donated to them we get

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,320
all the love that idea some of it is for

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,020
the build system especially some of them

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,410
are privately owned although we're based

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,350
on those out but smells to the stuff

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,160
stuff gets donated in many cases by HP

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,100
because I he is a very big small tilden

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,369
and then presumably they installed by

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,340
them in person thank you that's the hard

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,020
palate with the ginger once I'd say less

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,909
than fifteen percent of machines are

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,990
actually owned by our slowly mainly it's

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,360
a machine sitting at the data center

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,189
somewhere and we ask them please Bridget

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,830
on a live CD and tell us the IP and

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,470
we'll installer brought but actually

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,280
nokia runs all the hardware from name 0

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,500
which is kind of uncool but that's kind

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,479
of interesting side problems where you

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,650
guys do how many machines does centos

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,390
have them for its infrastructure with

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,150
all counting all the dead ones i guess

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,670
it 150 150 what a large n 200 eyes

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,360
will do such large number of machines

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,930
and mirrors for large part a so you

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,630
can't there's two it's a machine they

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,110
are owned by you of all the MERS look

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,210
know how I got this really faced

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,250
question it how many machines dis yo

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,550
infrastructure team directly manage yeah

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,940
like a girl under 50 the sorcerer so you

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,960
have couch over 150 machine you manage

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:17,730
is matter what you can i connect submit

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,410
can access those those are put on

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,020
machines okay they get pulled from

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,430
sometimes done before you want if you

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,230
want to test if you need to test machine

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,760
because it's a wall i won't test out

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,790
something new you can get a machine from

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,650
that pool to do that he won't you test

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,050
set as you can with what normally middle

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,670
of those are well mirrors to feed other

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,050
mirrors from probably that's primarily

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,420
most of the times they are doing their

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,240
stuff but on the month i can be used for

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,090
something else yes how many does jen 200

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,830
did in Gentry we have about 16 main

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,390
infrastructure machines in the moment

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:57,690
and then another 20 odd build machines

00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,450
yeah well I know if such demon that says

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,060
that on a flock of a guy who actually

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,110
using the search team for Debian they

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,850
were talking about a hundred month

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,000
machine I don't know where it comes from

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,280
but whatever I'm not how many do you

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,739
guys had oh I think it's much smaller

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,700
than that of salt being system it's

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,820
about and finishing convinces them just

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,010
to get it back till November maemo had

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,330
one yeah and then I pushed everything

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,780
out to it ah c'mon oh yeah yeah nokia

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,130
pays that bill dube you know they had

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,410
another machine that he built internally

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,410
but because of NDA restrictions are find

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,040
a firewall it's real a broken system i

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,040
don't recommend it but

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,390
and then you do have the management side

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,400
up off of the new structure so where do

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,940
those machines come from LuAnn we will

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,319
have to say thank you which machines do

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,560
I have to look after after I read well

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,519
listen this company went boom debian

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,680
actually had set up an LDAP directory

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,360
over a decade ago we're all that kind of

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,700
stuff is managed so also not the

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,310
continued after we have a file or

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,019
several files well you you really want

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,750
to have something else that's I think

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,940
more it's an internal wiki wiki control

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,370
yeah well we never before we have is

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,560
another blurry we're not only all uses

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,840
of stall them but also machines with

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,790
some extra schema first of the attitude

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,040
so you can actually add stuff like boost

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,280
local administrator who's the donator

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,440
who's the what's that SSH key store in

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,000
there as well I mean if you find when

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
the Machine goes yeah it's ugly duck the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,060
kind of stuffy stores over lies does

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,660
anybody use something I was supposed to

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:46,580
call gde TI no no GI hmm GOP ir

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,860
something different from one I don't

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:55,460
know what they needed the database for

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,530
doing sacrifice no write this thing what

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm solidarity was set up before I

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,590
became a dealing developer and I'm

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,169
became that mean developing two thousand

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,750
new one so it's quite old it's working

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,970
not too bad it has an issues it's

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:15,440
something homeroom as is the case from

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:17,450
much in w so yeah it doesn't jump k

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,820
money and planning side updates new

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,270
machines are you testing how do you

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,250
deploy stuff out there because the

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,040
neural network now go to center spot

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,950
completely

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,640
sent us for how we plan those updates

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,980
well the Debian their network is not

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,140
owned by them you actually mostly people

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,360
who run a channel mirror and oh yeah we

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,760
can educate you true we have those those

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,650
are most of our members to run over but

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,890
you have the internal stuff whose well

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,600
lebanon probably has the same luxuries

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,720
we have we have pretty long running

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,790
distributions mm well like well we have

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,770
seven years so while yet some of the

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,920
sheets will also send a sizable one hour

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:03,510
zat Arras our release of the next rebuke

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:06,960
us one year actually so that's currently

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,670
about three years multiple do you think

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,680
there's a possibility to share some of

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,010
the infrastructure cross distro

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,020
particularly mirrors I mean since

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,240
they're basically two major packing

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,450
packaging formats you would think that a

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,680
lot of rpms are duplicated across the

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,650
various mirrors across the various

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,300
districts well yeah but not get started

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,310
the same over yet no not necessarily

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,230
same chambers and on different versions

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,270
libraries yeah that's true but there's

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,220
probably some redundancy I mean a thing

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,570
you could have multiple mirrors multiple

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:43,350
packet repair it before trying to share

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:47,250
either binary binary packages it would

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:50,070
mean starting to share either spec file

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,000
for our up here you can usually read my

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,850
rules it's only right if you look at the

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,020
tabular you bunt to they sometimes have

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,150
packages with the same name because they

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,920
were both from the exact same source but

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,720
the version in debian was built against

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,040
this vibrating the version is in a bunch

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,780
of other people to get that library so

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,400
if you try installing the winter version

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,550
or a deputy machine everything goes

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,740
kaboom so that we could have separate

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,000
repos well yeah ok but then you're not

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,890
really shouting structure anymore you're

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,080
just sharing the hardest their fault

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,370
yeah and when it comes down to just

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,440
cherry hard disk I think you may end up

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,300
getting bit better results are all

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,889
systems with

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,960
implication so they don't have to know

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,960
is that the files the same thing right

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,300
economical this model was proposed I

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,560
said well let's at least 44 the inter

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,120
pressing business let's all have the

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,389
same kernel let's all have the same

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,099
would see holy which doesn't work either

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,990
against good hmm something is happening

00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,759
there between will be let that would be

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,169
one possibility to do move in the

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,819
direction like grandpa on the other end

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,710
users well you have machines we have

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,990
machines and can let machines which is

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,860
with I don't think it can really share

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,710
yours this is just too dependent on poor

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,840
poor just wish this on I mean mandriva

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,969
Susan RPM so I won't get anywhere in

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,400
Rivera p.m. installing centos wrong

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:11,840
number without force with horse yelling

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:17,900
or if it doesn't work that but you get

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,150
ebook me oh I feet 6 feet games that's

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,310
not really infrastructure but also has

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,430
to happen how do you think about your

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,430
man

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,140
yes wiki wiki nothing well wouldn't be

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:39,610
on me also an editor lockdown internal

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,380
access early we know haha holy quickie

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,969
and an undersea policy ducky well we're

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,220
everywhere for you have privately our

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,529
numbers in them so even though we don't

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,870
know me that might be so wait so wait

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,700
you share that information well it's on

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,110
an internal mailing list and oh my god

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,670
how impatient everything we do in

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,320
Vicki's is just we should I realize that

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:02,680
I have phone numbers and stuff that's

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,199
why nobody's you then that's why another

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,490
battery is good idea just to held up

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:08,440
search and you have the information you

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,180
can lock that down transfer to the only

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,190
one to your own developers to have had

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,140
average in that we've actually have a

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:19,620
web problem is well where you can search

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,620
and an update stuff so grocery vol I P

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,420
for documentation we actually have three

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,570
modes mainly we've got people authority

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,269
banks with documentation excited for our

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,720
policy and stuff like that we've also

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:38,130
called Sam yeah the wiki what this you

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,430
will be a lot this oxygen and we have

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:46,959
the in your web web page yeah which is

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,459
mainly mainly a public public CVS

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,010
upholstery that gets all non-free

00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:52,480
multiplying compared to work and stuff

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,490
so

00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:06,370
basically I think everybody does it that

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:09,029
way yeah we're counting system where you

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,029
can subscribe

00:10:32,830 --> 00:11:18,530
this I because okay there has to be

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,420
infrastructure stuff which is not public

00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,270
because I'm not gonna tell anybody the

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:28,040
IP address of the service whoa whoa okay

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:29,450
that a Canadian slicker I don't but God

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,370
wanna have a list of their who Zeppelin

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:36,770
on the machine or who is responsible for

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:40,970
a machine or why not why would that be

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,890
for me yessir it's like we share quite a

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,230
linear structure team on his private

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,030
Wittering all the infrastructure team

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,640
has access what shouldn't be public

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,400
though then I great hope you have to

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,750
know your password okay obviously the

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,580
passwords are not going to be a public

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,620
wave you want to make sense but little

00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,660
later is to read to be on there why not

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,790
I mean if somebody to yes if I don't

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,160
want to suppress that that sponsors

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,650
explicitly required that's a different

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
matter that's right about saying I fight

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,530
many general they should be this but

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,330
that that would be there we stay okay

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,770
silly the song tubby would be

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,300
specifically request that they are

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:19,400
elicited but what I'm thinking is um

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,360
yeah much of this information that as

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,010
long as it

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,410
compromised through security that they

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:28,610
don't think there's any harm in making a

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,320
public and it actually makes it easy

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,149
people if they see something is going

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,709
wrong makes it easier you need to figure

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:43,640
out where to go okay I'm sorry also

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:47,810
proposes how to take up because I will

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:51,320
know how changes maybe there's some

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,420
there boys it's on the wiki oh there's

00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:00,040
there's a page on the main website and

00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:00,040
you're quite far beyond some alex is

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,100
closing time then you can simply take

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,290
part in this 15 and you have your

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,360
responsibilities and women this

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:18,470
infrastructure team to share information

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:21,440
like Fedora has standard operating

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,470
procedures that they publicly list so

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,880
anybody who saw a server go down reads

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,170
the standard operating procedures and

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,730
follows those procedures to bring the

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,160
server backup right yeah a lot of other

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:39,050
distros don't do that you know that's a

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,930
good idea yes it is indeed a major

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,670
problem within de buena to get more

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,350
volunteers to work on that that is true

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,260
you know fighting infrastructure people

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,260
is very difficult but standard operating

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,579
procedures I think would really help yes

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,930
there are but you are procedures on the

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,329
internal wiki that we really should

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,500
publish like how how we go about

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,590
installing a new machine from scratch

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,570
right let me give them out

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,160
yourself you're like like babe based on

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,880
your initial show this is what you have

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,410
to do to fire up the automation so I

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,750
have to largely you agree with what

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,490
these guys said it's and just it's some

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,310
sort of the spirit of open source that

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,990
you just it's not it won't compromise

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,700
the security so you just put it online

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,500
in the public we can you just protect a

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,540
page from being edited by anyone and

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,300
then you right there while we do it this

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,120
way any user can read what how you do it

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,380
but you won't be able to just do it

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,410
because he has doesn't have the right

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,810
credentials to access anything and well

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,660
it wouldn't be really transparent for

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,130
for someone who stands for open source

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,230
software when it just says well our

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,480
internal structure is hidden from you

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,420
you don't see how we work internally so

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,340
it's it's a natural thing for me and the

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,560
information it has actually to be kept

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,780
secret it's just a few access

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,790
credentials and phone numbers and the

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,950
rest can be made public because there's

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,770
no secrets among those this extension

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,020
restaurant have that their discussion

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,410
we're having at the moment should all

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:13,070
uses be able to see negoro stages of

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,920
what's down why not yes what what what's

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,980
a Harman what our dream exactly because

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,720
I mean if you go to I think's actually

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,540
there's a benefit to it because if you

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,170
try to duck to access something and it

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,240
doesn't respond and then it might be at

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,710
your end we can get the remote and if

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,080
you can actually exit the monitoring

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,340
system you can see oh yeah its server is

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,840
down then you know you don't need to

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,920
look further you can tell die people

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,600
that hate the surface that you might

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,830
want to reboot it whereas if you don't

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,750
know that the server is down you might

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,680
be assuming that oh it's probably going

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,990
to be running because these guys are

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,940
good so it has to be your minds and

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,440
you're wasting half an hour or half a

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,450
day to figure actually the server was

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,270
that and so it's actually a good thing

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,640
to make those kinds of things public and

00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:00,620
I don't think it would compromise here

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,570
your ear and you say that your your your

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,860
reputation or anything because if your

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,120
server goes down occasionally because I

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,860
mean everybody in the sub go down

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,200
allocation it but it's already another

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,490
big video clearly project we can find

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,950
this doing this already is Mozilla that

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:19,510
mean debian semi does that not really

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:22,220
there's a there's a there's a something

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,970
some some website where you can actually

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,990
go yeah but is it the one is not exactly

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,510
well that i already have to deal with

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,060
you or others yeah same same goes for

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,740
hours and it comes up with a password

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:40,220
which is guest or something yeah yes

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:42,050
yeah so I mean it's sunny public but I I

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,960
don't think it there's any harm in

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:48,440
having a public as long as you don't put

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,970
off any friends over yes yeah there will

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,670
give you a foundation to whittier guys

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:56,839
publish both the nagios and the cacti

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:59,180
dropping from you people okay I think

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,460
part of the open-source group do as well

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,839
but these are both the host emotional

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,240
company I mean most egregious publish

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,579
their where our stuff does most of

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,850
solutions or publish the stars for me

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:17,449
rose yes yeah which certainly makes

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,980
sense because yeah also because of those

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:25,959
illusions you can't control or was it

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,959
ourselves all right but I think the arts

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:44,130
how do you want to besides how do you

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:47,670
want to make sure that one who got the

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:52,650
knowledge to medical machines to answer

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:56,180
person and knows what few guards and

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:59,760
we're getting to the infrastructure and

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:09,840
this is something I'm not yet sure aha

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:13,140
theatre way on because what how do you

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,610
want that's one of the road

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:20,220
infrastructure men never us have to know

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,880
the new infrastructure member personally

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,160
what if he or she comes from India I no

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,490
one knows him or her how can you make

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,330
sure that you can trust in order holy

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,800
healthy same thing all do you bring new

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,810
people and I think the trust thing is

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,250
large thing because well see seeing what

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,840
people can do that I can vocalize your

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,280
sense of mailing list and say well what

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,230
are you doing there plain wrong because

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,660
if you want to do it correctly do it

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,130
that in that way sir you get from people

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,510
who play they know the stuff they're

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,550
doing and they're interested in doing

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,200
senator but i think the trust the trust

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,950
thing really really is goes very very

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,810
deep in debian that trust poem is

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,730
basically solved by saying that only

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,890
deputy valves can become structure p

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,660
yeah and then and you have in the mold

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,090
johnny has to develop a process but you

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,910
have a project such as rather harsh

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,080
harsh i would love you it has any do you

00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,820
know that i'm involved with that

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,490
developers i wouldn't use that word

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,810
harsh but i understand what's involved

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,950
that it's getting better it's getting

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,930
better isn't getting much better I

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,759
didn't say it was bad so you said Harvey

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:25,339
said harsh it's the same thing

00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,070
if we relate questioner is anybody

00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:30,259
that's joined deviant explicitly to work

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,019
on the infrastructure team more did they

00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,719
join us develop forcibly I said drill up

00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,579
on purpose don't think so Montella sure

00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:40,669
but I don't think so we did get one

00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:44,179
person who joined Justin to

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:46,070
documentation knots packaging and in

00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:49,099
theory there's no no problem with

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,449
joining just as an infrastructure member

00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,519
we don't have proceeded with that yet if

00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:54,229
somebody were to to suggest that they

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,989
wanted to do that we have to figure out

00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:59,299
how to come up with that but basically

00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,440
if you are given a minute out but if you

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:05,109
want to be part of the assertion you

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,109
have to be that we are approached car

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:18,319
conceded that way and people have you

00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,449
know you don't they you can get the code

00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,369
for Debbie and build systems at for DAC

00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:24,289
and for referee bro and all that stuff

00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,179
and commit patches and that on one way

00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,489
to get in not sure if you did that you

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,679
get sponsored and rocking a very easy

00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,389
way in so in that regard it's all open

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,099
they're not necessarily going to let you

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:38,440
log on to the machines and start hacking

00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,440
code but the codes all available yeah

00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:48,469
not personally but you need to know who

00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,569
he is and then you need a broad god I

00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:52,459
mean not personally asked in person but

00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,289
you need to know who they are ya yeah

00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:58,099
they're like in the case of the judge

00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:59,479
and stuff did this two cases first of

00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,029
all I use physically joining as

00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,769
infrastructure learning had I think

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:06,169
three people from that and they're all

00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:09,169
happen to work at ourselves open source

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,759
lab so they really knew when I

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,489
infrastructure that was there that's why

00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:16,039
I infrastructure that yeah they've got

00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:19,159
my truck machines ready that's why they

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:21,469
would you join me but then you have to

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,829
have been a developer for these three

00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:23,829
months

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,800
and somebody else that isn't already an

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,260
infrastructure member must vouch for you

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,850
such a cerebral proteins you have to

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,770
have some people's and pointed out no oh

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,910
yeah in our case is even more general

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:44,730
that more moderators on the forums on

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,740
our floor were wrecked on the forums we

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,929
don't have been the gentle wiki is not

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,090
in house is actually entirely extra an

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:53,520
external entity that runs it so it

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,840
doesn't really count right but they've

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,000
been some knowledgeable people there

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,059
that we've said you know what you're

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:18,570
doing going on right now like then so

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:23,400
they sort of documentation some kind of

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,230
special isn't that the only way to do it

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,150
because all the build systems are

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,770
different you know knowing how to build

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,059
packages on debian is not going to help

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,860
you know how to build packages for

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,809
CentOS and the infrastructure is

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,280
catering to those tools and the

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,559
infrastructure is probably custom-made

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,030
so this is probably the only way let's

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,280
say recruit people and mentor them

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,510
through let's let's listen one of the

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,420
reasons why I won't have this this

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,429
voluntarily to learn I always do it and

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,770
if they're broke maybe they are process

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,570
is a very good say well what's do that

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,100
together or let me learn from you

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,550
because you simply use it to be doing

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,550
the right way

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:26,620
I notice that there are no need for

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:32,980
national barrel debian see you have to

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:39,250
beat again developer so this is the top

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:43,860
hat in the diminutive is just a person

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,860
who is the ability up packages into so

00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:13,179
so okay well we do have that we do have

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,190
that I don't it's not be mentioned that

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,470
doesn't mean we don't have at least in

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,580
that we've got people to do mail lists

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,919
and we've got people who do system

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,559
administration we've got people do ftp

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,570
master which is the mirror network in

00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,850
charge of build yeah so we have a

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,919
technical team who governs all them into

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:33,159
so there's a lot of very well defined

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,840
roles that's only true maybe if we crazy

00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,029
enough to do it because otherwise some

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,399
people would do everything in there just

00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:40,929
doesn't work and there was a lot

00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,720
actually interested in doing everything

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:46,090
right because I get all you're

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,289
interested in like one small thing right

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,539
like we've got two guys that are very

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:52,120
interested in the vermin in our we were

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:54,659
assigned and they run they run they're

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,659
pretty damn well

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:09,750
you have to count the possible a further

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:16,440
five or six turbocharger now which is

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:25,140
then continued I think this is something

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:27,320
very specific so I propose a separate

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,890
research would you clearly defined

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,540
document I think the only people to meet

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,340
over here with some counters the

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,980
argument for the genders rate is that

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,240
can a volunteer-based organization

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,760
putting people down to specific rule

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,230
creates lacquered yeah you need unless

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,750
you've got a significantly large pool of

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,820
resources you cannot have people working

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:51,050
with in silos because if you do you're

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,050
creating black holes that you don't know

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,970
in that mean i'm guessing the number is

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,560
not in single digit I'm guessing there's

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,150
more than ye people doing the structures

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:05,820
is probably possible yes much more

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:10,200
accounts built administrators and system

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:12,720
administrators and FB masters at list

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,550
masters I'm sure you'll get in about 30

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,740
to 40 people something like that he says

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,080
did you structure chamber gentle 97

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,970
people but it changes I mean you're

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,400
pointing to a very fundamental fact that

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,990
these are volunteer organizations you

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,120
can't tell somebody are you going to

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,970
work from nine to five this week you

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,400
can't say well can you dedicate 40 hours

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,560
a month you have to sort of take what

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,650
they can give and that that's a

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,710
fundamental problem I mean and I mean

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,140
with management is a down time we're

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,200
breaking we've had two in debian then

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,060
yeah these people gets need to dedicate

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,450
a lot of time that they may or may not

00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,380
have and so it is something to worry

00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,380
about actually

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,050
by the way one more thing that I notice

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,850
of course design is quite specifically

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:08,960
here is that developers make very bad oh

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:14,810
yeah very bad what to say that means but

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:17,270
we do find that the people who tend to

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:20,180
be seized mins don't tend to have a lot

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,430
of packages in Libya in my opinion they

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,260
take this isn't min and they may have

00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,560
one or two packages maybe something that

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,630
they just happen to use but indeed for

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,950
stuff they use else is in it yeah I tell

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,690
you that's what I mean there's something

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:36,230
that they haven't used for desolate been

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,420
working independent but usually they

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,850
don't have a lot of packages at least

00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,370
the whatever I looked up it is because

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,690
they spent so much time as seasoning

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,570
that they don't have time to do

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,610
packaging work or is this some reason I

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,170
don't know but the idea a bunch of

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,330
idiots who once they're not interested

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,280
heavily in the packaging process right

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,680
yeah developers tend not to care about

00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,180
packaging at all they see it as a

00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,670
necessary evil that they'd like to get

00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,670
out of you look at Python and Ruby they

00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:08,510
both have watch ready and I said are you

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:11,210
calling those packages oh yeah it was

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,860
very thing that ruby has some of the

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,040
most brilliant people working on it and

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,299
jen's is exactly is a very fine example

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,320
of how

00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:22,610
he should run it yeah deafness but these

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,559
are problems for the distributions

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,179
because I hear from developers pearl

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,039
developers all time they say Oh Debbie

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:30,980
ins too old while you're using that

00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:33,529
unstable it's not old it's stable user

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,200
testing oh that's too cutting edge no

00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,639
not unstable testing so but that's

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,580
that's an issue for all distributions

00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:45,019
how yeah what's your stable period what

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:54,580
your magic to to use fedora you don't

00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:54,580
get any yellow that stay with what 13

00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:59,960
well yes but there's a problem

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,820
developers don't want to do packages

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,289
because they won't develop right so the

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,909
first don't want to do packages because

00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,379
the motors disciplines but they depend

00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,460
on the packages because I don't want to

00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:12,739
say certain machines which aren't

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:18,169
packaged right thank you so some of the

00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:20,210
asking packages aren't most people most

00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:22,669
developers in all distributions doing

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:26,210
mostly packaging or most of them

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:27,980
indefinitely stood up but we have it

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:33,440
rather easy package I have done for you

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:39,830
guys you just steal yeah but you weren't

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:43,039
too sure yeah so now in each policy cops

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,960
infrastructure software now it gets

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,580
confusing you've got things like it like

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,440
your package manager for that mean SD

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,539
package which we develop ourselves but

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,669
mostly but some of us need of ourselves

00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,830
and we do have some other software that

00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:57,499
we need to do but in DTM most I think

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,340
most developers for distribution will be

00:29:57,499 --> 00:30:00,340
packages that's three

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:04,649
I think Susie's open the old service

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:05,940
will present a very interesting

00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:08,669
challenge because I think that it can

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,919
build both Deb's and rpms and if you

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:12,210
have an automated system you're taking

00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,700
away the human element of building

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,350
packages and that's going to give yes

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,399
but we have to have a rules far from the

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,379
Debian packages you have to have a

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,759
backpack for the rpms and you have to

00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:24,720
have a different spectral force which

00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:26,879
rpms will keep in mind the difference

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,129
between distributions that are not not

00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:31,799
just only packaging formats they are

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:33,360
more than just different for multiple

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,360
packages precisely and when you have an

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,369
automated tool that builds packages then

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,799
you don't you're hopping over a human

00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,809
and there's a difference in quality in

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,059
the package so this has to be a human

00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:47,700
that does it has the internal knowledge

00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,769
of difference between debian and red hat

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,480
for example I don't know if open Suzy

00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:53,879
has this but I do know that there are

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,950
distributions that use open Susie's

00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:57,659
build system to build their district so

00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,639
what you still need to do is you still

00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,230
have to know some Newman has to decide

00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:03,059
how do i configure the spectra do i

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,840
enable this feature do i disable it what

00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,970
do I build two packages that let's

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,850
disabled and one it's enabled or do I

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,470
just does this build system does this

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,299
package have a plug ins infrastructure

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,769
do I ship the plugins at the same

00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,450
package do I split them and separates

00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,570
already decide it's a little too since

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,429
that's a human has to do and after that

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,110
I mean you don't compile it to yourself

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:26,879
after that after that seaside you just

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,499
run your compile tool and if the ever

00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:30,299
Bob does it or if you just type one

00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:32,610
command to compile there's no huge

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,499
difference for me so did her decisions

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,690
still have to be made by a human who

00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:38,519
puts this specifications into the build

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,899
system I mean even if you saw the

00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,289
spectral it's gonna be a copy of your

00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:44,970
file or whatever or maybe specification

00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,619
that it's just a specification of how to

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,919
build something and indeed whether

00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:52,139
what's our human built it in my type

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,289
make or the both types make their

00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:57,029
results going to be the same hopefully

00:31:54,289 --> 00:32:00,120
yeah well I do maintain a build system

00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:06,820
so i do say hopefully

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:09,490
yeah I mean yeah anyway for the opensuse

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,860
build services of course the case that

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,140
every pic chasm maintainer and more

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:17,110
specifically at maintained at group so

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,640
we divided up the packages into projects

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,880
where you can have proofs of maintainers

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,899
and it's also true that we built for our

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,899
debian and RPM based distributions and I

00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:31,390
think that chance because he agreed you

00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:35,889
just agreed that nobody really wants to

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:38,380
do packaging work so we've all gone

00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:41,350
through this console so we have to seek

00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,720
out specifically for packages which arm

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:50,350
I don't think that's the most effective

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:52,480
thing to do in so you have used to have

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,519
my own damn it what the Fox about naming

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,500
convention essence yes Norris be like

00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:01,450
itching is extremely difficult thing but

00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,220
it's also true that most people come in

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,590
as developers or disciplines and then

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,730
they have to be of courage and selection

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:13,630
competitors is it is saving enabling

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:15,789
users to both packages for I mean it

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,480
saving people to collaborate on on

00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:22,090
packaging it might be hard to reduce the

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,059
pain thank you for sharing pantages

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,710
officially near distribution but would

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:28,090
you take those packages by people you

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,350
don't know and put them official in you

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:34,990
distribution of course not now is it

00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,110
okay for you if you create a service

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,389
from our year and who these packages in

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:46,350
21 centralizers searchable repertory

00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:49,950
that's obvious in the arch some

00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,080
against a choice but you always have

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,640
been review process so we always have to

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,830
maintain a good and these people are

00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:08,129
responsible to reduce yes of course not

00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:10,609
impose a I think we just sorry about the

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:17,399
packaging packaging be in the hard work

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:21,300
do you think that this is that most

00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:25,859
packaging format are common for users to

00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:29,429
rise when you put like spectral tubules

00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:32,730
yeah I don't say that the one of them is

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:36,629
harder than other ones not offended but

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:43,149
don't you think that it depends on on

00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:48,010
the clarity and simplicity of

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:50,859
a number of users who would like to

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,619
write it yeah if you ask me personally I

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:56,889
would say yes it is it's the top of hard

00:34:53,619 --> 00:35:01,150
rock to the package no matter if it's

00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:05,980
back or or debian i would appreciate a

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:10,029
more simple thing that covered all but i

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:15,490
know that completely of the future

00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:17,380
because i'm gonna fascinated about all

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,480
these statements because then we

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,299
actually have exactly the reverse be

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,210
problem so over ninety percent of people

00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:27,250
in arch just they do packaging so people

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:30,160
package and nobody wants to do the other

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,869
stuff so there's people making hangers

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,930
and so on and then there's there's

00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:37,809
nobody taking care of that that mirrors

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,789
are in shape and and then this task

00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,549
given to someone and he gets lost in

00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:45,039
some worker and disappears or anything

00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:46,809
and nobody wants to do development

00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,640
acceptable package manager death and

00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,930
active development but all other things

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,089
that need development while they just

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,970
get stuck and get lost and so on when

00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:57,460
packaging is actually the part that has

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,510
enough has enough people on put on it

00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:03,970
but the rest is just well it's just not

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,400
improving there as fast as as it should

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,839
it will be considering the number of the

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
increasing number of users increasing

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,920
number of packages and so on so it's

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,289
just a reverse problem of most most if

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,990
you saturday I don't think me I think I

00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:20,039
said that in any what we have it what we

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:22,210
have been the main problem is is not

00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,650
people wanting to develop because that

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,839
does happen over there are some cases

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,549
where we need some more people but I

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,490
think the main issue we have in debian

00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:32,230
is that because the effort for a

00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,539
developer to maintain is about four or

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:37,750
five packages people saw complaining if

00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:40,750
you do more than 15 or something um yeah

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,010
so yeah except because I think I brought

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,260
my name with a couple hundred yeah

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,510
exactly but I mean if you do more than

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,730
15 or 30 packages people start really

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:52,170
complaining then so but the main domain

00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,170
probably have we have without is that

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,140
if people fail to see the big picture

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,890
and I think that's one of our main

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:03,420
issues frankly because I mean it's very

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,890
easy to get focused on those four or

00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,980
five or six projects that you're doing

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,660
and don't really care about what other

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:16,380
packages have been charged with yours

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:20,070
and so in Debian packages in average has

00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,540
have a small number of packages number

00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:26,190
of practice yeah absolutely there's one

00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:30,320
other may encourage it orys well okay

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:34,380
I'm fact that's this difficult question

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:38,070
it used to be the gated only that every

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,410
packet only had one maintainer and every

00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,150
maintained only it's up to 10 packages

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,410
and that this is still the case that

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:48,570
there is one main maintainer who is the

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,940
recent meeting but more often than not

00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:53,790
these days for March things like KDE

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,550
okok nope the maintain is a mailing list

00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,890
is group people and then there's people

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,440
who are list as upload or Co

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,330
maintainence basically and so we have t

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,280
maintain it and if you look at T

00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:08,370
maintains packages then you do see that

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,280
people are often member of a team where

00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,350
the team maintains like 50 100 packages

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,730
what I meant with the 30 pack is if your

00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,680
list as the sole maintaining of a

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,460
package any more than 30 min PeopleSoft

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,370
but but in teams the issue is not as big

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,510
because I mean there's then there's more

00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,820
people in the team who can actually look

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,510
at a fraction care effort cooking a

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,530
little bit packaging yeah sorry very

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,740
respectful thing sorry yeah should

00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,910
belong super wants to do too yeah

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:39,030
infrastructure it's kind of at the hardy

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,710
I'm sorry that the HR talk is directly

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:44,070
besides this tour kid what should have

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:46,250
been behind each other there's yeah

00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,750
super quick Google get internet also

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,470
well I mean doing doing HR 44

00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,470
distributions for

00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,020
Siddharth is in Yunnan resource yes yes

00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,450
we were talking about sign all the time

00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,369
at the moment how do people get into a

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,400
new distribution Arden people get into

00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:09,990
teams and distribution sir but that's

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,180
not to do to assure but I would like to

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,710
know this what is there any distribution

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:20,280
human case for that wonderful subject

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:22,260
you know if different pays very 10

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,950
service it goes I go somewhere by chance

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,660
service basically basically will fifteen

00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,360
percent about YouTube machines are owned

00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:34,530
by the gentoo foundation we do not have

00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:38,010
to pay for any posting Inn in debian the

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:40,560
case mostly that for things like our

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:44,580
main service if we need them we just ask

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,470
BRB who is linux CTO at eight key and he

00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,260
just hands us a bunch of service so

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:53,010
that's not the issue in the case of of

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:55,770
things like architecture specific hard

00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,359
drugs such as natural systems that's

00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:01,830
hard because HP doesn't have all them

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:05,130
they at I 64 there exists 64 bit and 32

00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:08,730
bit x86 but that's about it I change my

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:11,040
name is I 64 at the heb a but they

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,390
didn't do that anymore and so they're

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,580
the problem is harder and in that case

00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,100
what happens usually that people

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:21,050
practically buy it and then get refunded

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:24,750
bite and they've been a bunch of money

00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:26,100
so yeah we or what it needs to be

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,800
repaired which happens with the old

00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:32,369
architecture quite often and then yeah

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,750
then those get repaired and get a film

00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:37,680
by Debbie but we don't actually buy

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:42,150
hardware and I guess we are the only one

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,160
who buy stuff that is specific because

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:47,640
mangry vice versa company is a company

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,750
and man regarded x is community project

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:54,090
robot company provides service and I

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,720
grab my guitar with I was out for food

00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:50,230
orders of the same would be true

00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:52,770
yeah do you feel you have an over

00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:55,660
concentration of machines at any one

00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:58,060
single sponsor that it could actually

00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,950
threaten things if that sponsor or its

00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,109
own weight away good question I don't

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,510
think we have that we have two or three

00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:06,250
core machines and with one sponsor

00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,200
that's what could be a problem you're a

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,200
commercial organization Santos is though

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:16,420
we're not alone you're not who sees what

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,130
commercial with these community but your

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,160
target is certainly businesses as

00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,660
opposed to say ordinary users although

00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,330
we want people say well I need the

00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,480
stability off of a enterprise solution

00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:29,770
but don't have the means to pay for that

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,530
but I don't get the spot and I know I

00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,480
don't get support for that so no not

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,970
really if there are business you want to

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,460
use that yes true many hostess with it

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:42,990
not here is not one of your problem with

00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:47,330
America lots of hoses on using centers

00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:51,300
here you get more Gary innocency I guess

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:55,290
all these in Germany I think this is

00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:58,650
company like to reply to your question

00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,120
about the single point of place yet I

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,710
think the problem that we have visit

00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,410
sent us is something which is completely

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,820
on the extreme other end and that you

00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,130
would really like to have more than one

00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,450
machine posted at the same place I think

00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,550
you've only got two sites where you've

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,410
got more than one machine so now you

00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,240
take the number of machines we've got

00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,710
and think about the fact that we don't

00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,750
have more than two machines in any one

00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:21,510
place you'll see how many different

00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:24,060
locations raw which spread over that's

00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,340
very very close and as the one process

00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,570
for support right everybody has their

00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,760
own ticketing system that you have

00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:31,620
forbidden we don't have adam debian

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,040
actually we've got the number of

00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:38,850
machines also that an HB data where the

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,890
data center and then some it's a great

00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,160
food i guess i'm not sure that's in

00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:46,050
texas so we've got like like you has

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,800
some ten locations and that of course

00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:53,780
the office small ones you students

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,890
orange sorry Houston 2984 right side yes

00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,960
right yeah but I was talking about brain

00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,000
food which is Texas it's a comp it's a

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,770
small company they also have some day

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,260
they used to hosts muscle does not open

00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,000
some other things time for ginger I'd

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,250
say fifty percent of our machines are

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,890
between 44 big sponsors that just

00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:13,040
haven't had the machine there right it's

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,210
all problems we can to failover because

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,220
yeah Sheen's aren't sitting inside each

00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,930
other or they could be anything it

00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,670
doesn't shoot them do it on see each

00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,190
other that could be anything but we know

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,260
the data centers on fire or we come to

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,710
fellow for other reasons but yeah yeah

00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,570
okay actually that's actually a larger

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,540
problem than halved in this different

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,370
locations yeah i mean the jet you poros

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,570
it said most popular thing we keep

00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,180
having to increased about the hardware

00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,580
for that we had if you're doing database

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,530
replication stuff lady sees a massive

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,140
problem you have to put all in one

00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,890
location run at the moment that that's

00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,289
for machine

00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:52,559
at times they know the dutch social

00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:57,930
network um they said care you guys can

00:44:52,559 --> 00:45:00,510
have four machines that's right hide it

00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,609
forms was it hives and now bugzilla is

00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,089
on those old machines and forums is

00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:07,079
moved to gossamer threads and egg cooker

00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:10,260
this worms didn't fit on the old

00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:13,079
machines inning right so you had to ship

00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,970
a whole bunch of data that's why I set

00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,470
small things meaningless because blocker

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,990
I didn't I didn't count in the forest we

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,819
draw it we have forums and we have more

00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,589
for subscribers when making the

00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:25,619
subscribers but I think we have more

00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:27,690
active many we have some users but we

00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:30,240
get before we do forms but they've been

00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,519
up Mets but look at meals oh so it's not

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,960
official look this thing with Daniel

00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,490
doesn't end up keeping up that every

00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,799
deputy hope I can set up with any donuts

00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,839
hostname and then you'll okis just

00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:41,279
that's maybe something interesting so if

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,089
you have them in a book that can only be

00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:46,049
modified by the Pegasus administration

00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:48,000
what lost have a look at the changes

00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:50,130
will change your firm's versus

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,009
amazingness and we ain't 5,000 forum

00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,619
post today and lists already getting

00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:57,329
three or four thousand I think we're

00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,980
kind of help is it the lists get a lot

00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:02,339
of posts and the forums are kind of dead

00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,369
oh that's not necessarily true they

00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:08,369
almost you know and Tess had set that up

00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:09,690
and then they really weren't in uniform

00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:11,700
thing but they said it up because people

00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:14,339
were some people were and at some point

00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,309
they got compromised and that was very

00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:19,890
good and then they disable it and then

00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:21,869
they came complaints and then somebody

00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,339
else volunteer to maintain it was more

00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:24,990
into dude I think we had more formed

00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,970
perfectly we have but I don't know I

00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:30,299
don't know how much fun but the

00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:32,519
decumanus is mostly positive a huge oh

00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:34,650
yeah yo man it's a white busy energy

00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:36,450
yeah yeah you have 12,000 Devon develops

00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:40,069
on that yeah and other people were

00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:42,299
interested right but we've got it got

00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:44,339
massive amounts of posts a day in a

00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,809
sense of even can't expand and reach

00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:49,140
ninety percent gets thrown away

00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:51,869
thing we have 100 200 miles closed today

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:56,369
on next days so that's not that much to

00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:59,400
get that much bye Milly yes I don't want

00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,170
to think about it here's an interesting

00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,640
statistic give me and above the patient

00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,469
I did last Sunday in 21 differently but

00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,999
on Monday we'll also machine Russia

00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,859
which we don't know if you're going to

00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:11,999
get back against the way down to 20 but

00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:13,920
we are talking to people through

00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:15,239
different data centers in China so that

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,390
goes through the next week we may be

00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:20,249
back after 21 / y por another thing

00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:24,239
that's we have a mission in China is

00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:26,189
that a mission the Great Firewall it is

00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,259
an issue because both of these data

00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:30,749
centers have multi-gigabit connectivity

00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:32,219
within China abroad but one of them and

00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:35,039
this is this is the Citroen this guy

00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:39,199
actually only has 128 kilobytes named

00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:41,609
the rest of the world is the maximum

00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,499
packet filtering cable that the couple

00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,599
of the China's going to give me it's not

00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:48,059
the capacity but he can't push more than

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,619
128 k at time because governor's all

00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:52,019
today after all of the traffic to that

00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:59,249
right so the problem is he started

00:47:52,019 --> 00:48:02,819
sinking he hasn't finished here Wow

00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:05,400
which is Satan same thing in Africa he

00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:06,839
supposedly has a well okay Oh only 10

00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,420
and we link to to South attitude to

00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:10,619
Africa or into Egypt well it was where

00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,650
we could we couldn't see the machine

00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,829
it's just the initial rsync wasn't done

00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:19,109
after four days after fundraiser just

00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:23,069
didn't finish so there's is there same

00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:24,900
office update was thinking 430 project

00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:26,999
he might have better cook he might have

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,279
been a fun activity into Egypt or

00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:30,630
injured two neighboring countries but it

00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:33,929
was a hell that is gone you don't get

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:35,219
you don't get the stuff there so not

00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:38,509
like the question I I would be

00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:44,559
interested in who actually has

00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:47,619
infrastructure in South America

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,140
besides precise results are recognizing

00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:55,689
ensure we're presenting here to Brazil

00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:57,819
machine for one at least dr. Morgan and

00:48:55,689 --> 00:49:01,509
her go ahead more than cheetah Africa

00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:04,269
she had one into today we haven't had

00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:06,180
one in section of the theater Oh anyone

00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:10,509
else having machines after looking it up

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:15,369
okay at the moment I know we don't slash

00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:18,009
sheets with bacteria is it so cheap Asia

00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,319
is not a point ball yes Taiwan probably

00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:23,259
singapore from Lydia well I don't Korean

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,239
I'm gonna see what stuff in a everything

00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:26,680
like I've got a lot to say because

00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:28,420
if they don't it says the name of the

00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:32,099
sponsor Roman location so we have to

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:37,359
check all the do it's not a one sorry

00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:39,819
four minutes okay no no nobody we

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,309
actually have a break afterwards so we

00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:44,079
can run a little over if we want to yeah

00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:46,719
but sank she ever supposed to finish it

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,929
wins in three minutes a show friends

00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,059
wind up what's up huh it was right way

00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:57,699
what do you win you get to end up

00:49:52,059 --> 00:50:00,249
maintain a server when I was a little

00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:04,469
weight 111 next dog starts in half an

00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:07,119
hour marine Columbia I would very gladly

00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:08,229
well yeah we think everybody has a

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,509
mirrors all of the world that doesn't

00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:11,890
count yeah so with the Chinese thing

00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:13,959
used to finish that started what we're

00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,150
working on is that Hong Kong has not a

00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,549
capacity so we'll be working on is a

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,949
couple

00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:24,769
USB hard drives so we actually get it to

00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:25,939
the Hong Kong and we ship using funny is

00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:27,890
actually sounds really funny for what

00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,900
happens is because we don't have any

00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,699
seats in China I guess I machinery down

00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,089
ourselves they don't have been clear for

00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:38,029
external users to China we estimate that

00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:41,689
we've got six digits of users in China

00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:43,219
but these guys want to click traffic but

00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:44,959
these guys want to hit update winners in

00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:46,489
other parts of the world they generate a

00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:48,799
phenomenal amount of traffic out of

00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:50,269
China and a lot of marriages don't like

00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:52,039
it whether it's because of politics

00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:54,380
whether it is because of policy we've

00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,819
had to be that matters when I think you

00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,189
know I said if I married for centos in

00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:01,849
Germany I go horn what how much was it

00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:03,829
you got four terabytes of up

00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:07,219
because he didn't have a Morlock I oh

00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:09,229
and there but they are getting hit from

00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:11,809
from some downloads of revelations from

00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:14,509
Donald manager which hits the mirrors of

00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:16,779
parallel and if you kill the IP address

00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:19,009
just comes back for the next IP address

00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:20,209
just because most people can't get the

00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,309
software different on different way so

00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:23,719
they try to scrapping as many mirrors as

00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:25,549
possible from as many IP address is

00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:28,309
impossible but seems to be some some

00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:31,640
written chinese-based download

00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:32,869
landcruiser from never had before DDoS I

00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,359
thought you guys have well-defined

00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:38,359
policies is to how often usually should

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,069
hit mirrors before they get then as we

00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,499
don't know we don't roll more sparrows

00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:44,900
know you guys do our synch mirrors okay

00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,670
what would change you with the awesomer

00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,949
aside there's actually two separate

00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:52,089
here's the core said awesome got it

00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:54,739
can't you do it all is strictly in-house

00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:58,479
we we guaranteed the content of those

00:51:54,739 --> 00:52:01,099
murders we validate did not get that and

00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:02,509
they typically run a few minutes ahead

00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:04,519
of the community mirrors because the

00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:07,640
normal community burrows I will maintain

00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:09,319
it very hard all the actual core ones

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,890
actually serve directly from Ramses

00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:15,979
doesn't that doesn't touch this wow how

00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:19,230
launch our your issue data that all six

00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:21,869
said it's hot I system

00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,450
better than 80 bytes of data then you

00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:26,790
have to watch out by notes if you don't

00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:29,430
tell if you don't watch out so 280

00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:32,220
megabytes of data okay I mr. kidding

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,500
right if you don't if you don't watch

00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:37,440
out I know it's it it lights up to about

00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,869
700 mix right well we at the moment to

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,250
have our internal sync machines open if

00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,050
you know which machine it is you can

00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,030
swing from there we reserve the right to

00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:47,910
public to publicize your Machine Man

00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:52,170
this is the arson panel says well only

00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:56,010
swing from here if you are not it's only

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:59,070
in english in debian d'oeuvres I think

00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:01,140
it's all based on online TXS lists so if

00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,119
you want to be a primary mirror you talk

00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,770
to the mirrored mins and then they give

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,210
you an account and then you get that we

00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:07,890
have met for DVD in the moment so if you

00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,450
want if you want to self a DVD find

00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:12,300
another mirror ask who already asked the

00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:15,750
DVD or not and then they work with as a

00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,980
triggers so when must finish you as a

00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,850
chin do there and it starts a process

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:22,260
and you can disconnect the get so it's I

00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:24,300
wanna fall it's really wonderful model

00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,130
yeah we work i do have restricted where

00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,400
it's cold right now a community mirrors

00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,500
to access the rest of the gingiva is

00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,440
they're all single country code on those

00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,210
old community-run ones that are they

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:41,550
have a Moritz specific neural early they

00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:43,140
can access these are the games so does

00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:48,000
that mean that or if you are submitters

00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:50,010
after that then Hayden I be no because

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,570
it is arson third country Cody and I TV

00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:59,490
host arson Oh unless you can look yeah

00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:02,490
would you have a a bunch of them that

00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,440
they regularly send us the IP data like

00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,740
every 60 minutes if you haven't sent if

00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:12,590
we expire it out the list so kind of

00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:12,590
dynamic dns road bump doc

00:54:54,890 --> 00:55:06,240
it's based on area it's really fast in

00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,560
oh it's really ugly Thanks usually thing

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,660
is a key in the very very talked just

00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:13,200
before this one yeah it's an identity to

00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:14,790
be losing the resolution yeah yeah the

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,340
top right before this one was talking

00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:18,810
about the program mayor brain which

00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:24,570
actually does what you just described me

00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:26,220
so do with imagining yeah yeah yeah okay

00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:31,320
how I did the figures talk so yeah

00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:33,750
whatever cuz you're pissing there was a

00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,820
reason why I tried to walk them together

00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,890
yeah it was a reason why I didn't want

00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,360
to do mirror and ash Park here because I

00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,980
understand all kind of different

00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,980
problems like it right yeah sure

00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,730
I was going to say you know you were

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,920
talking about bringing people in to get

00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:59,690
for such a pain does anybody do

00:55:51,920 --> 00:56:01,130
interviews for costs or yeah definitely

00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,810
when you people join the infrastructure

00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,370
team there's a couple of there are

00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:06,590
things of the book the top of the easy

00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:09,320
to easy items to do John the to do this

00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:12,110
the care is something that needs doing

00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:16,040
yeah I think I think if you start

00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:18,650
selecting people I think you'll find

00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,240
that most usually you've got to fever

00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,310
for all to use as it is and if you start

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,170
selecting them you you end up with even

00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:25,850
less and then you've got my 4-h problems

00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,010
it's usually best to give them some

00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:31,370
low-hanging fruits and see how they do

00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:33,140
and then if they do well then give them

00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,040
some more responsibilities I think

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,630
that's the best way to do it because

00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,220
otherwise you start three different

00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,960
people and if they if they do dude

00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,550
low-hanging fruit in and then either

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,500
mess up or it takes way too long or

00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,580
something else goes goes wrong then you

00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,350
know you don't want to give them

00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,940
anything else and you you move on and

00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,180
they move on and they've had a chance

00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:55,940
and you you seen it didn't work out so I

00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:58,600
ain't no harm done at that point I think

00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:02,390
that's the best way to do it presently

00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:04,370
example some of these starts to be one

00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:07,670
book comes up pretty frequently for Gen

00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:09,920
2 is actually the initial setup of

00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,740
machine just trying to fire in the

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:16,640
automation in our case return to its

00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,040
that you log into the machine you can

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,540
end up going to be partition the

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,220
machines manually that's a lot of pollen

00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:25,370
the automation just because the machines

00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:27,500
in to bury a fair bit so you can begin

00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:30,440
to be able to do that partition machine

00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:32,930
and set up the lbm and then you have to

00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,300
read enough of our internal see App

00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:37,820
Engine documentation and set up to add

00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,920
the new machine to CF engine so when you

00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,110
fire the automation that the automation

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,240
is going to work and they get to read

00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,190
the logs to say CF engine failed to add

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,470
this machine why because you forgot

00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,770
something in the configuration I'm not

00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,770
the last

00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:59,810
movie puppet I don't know how good the

00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,150
engine is with rural isolation were

00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,069
popular than chef and V CFG are really

00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:06,369
bad at it so if you have to give

00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:08,960
somebody access to zip engine and the

00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:10,400
manifests behind it that person could

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,089
pretty much do anything on any machine

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,319
anywhere yes they've I know as I can

00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:17,000
change your whole bathroom stuff on

00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:19,609
almost any machine and then you boot the

00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,980
mouse and you you have talked to many

00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:24,170
more either in a couple errands back

00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:27,200
down the entire time ginger structure

00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:29,839
team we've had a single person the

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,420
winter abusive and he was dealt with

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,130
within six hours exactly it isn't

00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,589
looking down at any money that's that's

00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:38,750
a question I have for you throw people

00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:40,010
out love that we have a luxury at the

00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,050
moment we've been able to throw people

00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:43,190
out but we've had we've had that problem

00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:48,650
with in debian and we've actually

00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:51,560
butit's a few people out mostly for not

00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,270
abuse being abusive in inter structure

00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,630
kind of things but more socially music

00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:58,160
so I and then have the Mexico City some

00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:00,319
years ago did yeah that was there was

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,109
one case that was a very well publicized

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,569
case under there was actually mid-flight

00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:07,280
on the spot and let's figure out how to

00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:08,690
get on so I guess key distribution and

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,300
possible solution is not automatically

00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:14,690
so you can revoke well yeah and very

00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,010
haha yes sir what's behind us ah do we

00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,349
were going or we have using all right

00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:20,000
right not but what we have for you we've

00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:21,500
got moved on Alabama tree so you just

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,450
remove them from the other version your

00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,220
candies Goulding within a few other with

00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,079
a few minutes actually because yeah that

00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,849
actually can pay the local cache of the

00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,069
telegraphy so first team is later your

00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:34,130
account is gone yeah I'm an effort for

00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:36,800
uploads that's essential gpg key server

00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:40,250
which contains Yuki if it goes out of

00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,380
there it's our sinks into the above

00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:45,589
making it made and software and so few

00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,359
minutes or by clicking on a regular

00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:49,910
developer is effective with within a

00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,299
couple minutes right arm as this Pacific

00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,709
ace

00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:53,719
we're having to move somebody out

00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:58,699
adamant out of the infrastructure team

00:59:53,719 --> 01:00:00,469
right and just the basic automation side

00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:06,849
of it is within half an hour but all

01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:06,849
this stuff you have to go to the machine

01:00:41,499 --> 01:00:45,739
I'll give a quick i'll give a pic on to

01:00:43,759 --> 01:00:47,539
this one but one of the other gents you

01:00:45,739 --> 01:00:48,979
guys is probably in the room over was

01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:51,829
actually just going to be discussing it

01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:54,439
more fully we have a list of a hole that

01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:55,849
goes out twice a week to we're a team

01:00:54,439 --> 01:01:00,109
with an internal team that we have

01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:03,019
called the retirement team and you get

01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:04,369
sick after 60 days with no kids will sit

01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:07,880
will set you an email ask you what

01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:11,209
what's up and if you don't respond to us

01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,939
within another 60 days you're gone see

01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:15,679
violently wait 60 days 60 60 days to

01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:17,569
notification and you get 60 days to

01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,130
respond sometimes running days hundred

01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:20,499
two hundred twenty days for months I'm

01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,150
gonna call your sauce for a drug-free

01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:24,979
one if your software's bug-free more

01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,589
like a smoky response to your respawn

01:01:24,979 --> 01:01:29,059
good but first as pretty good with it

01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:34,009
let me know within that minutes it's

01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:35,900
slightly less ultimately party which we

01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:38,420
don't call retirement we call the mi 18

01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,849
but infinitely saving yeah and well what

01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:43,369
we do there is if somebody should

01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:45,380
somebody's bait the bug pages is like

01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:49,189
many bugs there and nothing's happening

01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:53,089
or stuff like that then you get a mail

01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:56,059
from the mi a team what's up in a few

01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:58,160
more meals if nothing happens it can it

01:01:56,059 --> 01:02:00,890
does go a lot faster than 60 days from

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,200
that first moment but there's a few

01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:04,940
reminders because maybe the millions

01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,060
respectful to gain between supply bad we

01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:12,349
rescind a few more mail yeah sure okay

01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:13,490
60 days in 60 indeed eventually if we

01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:14,960
don't get any response or the mail

01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,849
bounces we'd have which happens people

01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,440
forgot to update any motive still they

01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:20,599
actually give people local email

01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,400
accounts so right yeah we do check yes

01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:23,960
we do love you the WT that means it let

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,700
me know then I know what mail is

01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,200
forwarded usually yeah so if you didn't

01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,980
update that and then your bouncers there

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:33,829
your call in minute indicate if he

01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:36,200
people are all active and don't respond

01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:38,060
to two mi team then eventually they get

01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,619
thrown out yeah like particularly if

01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:41,180
they've been around for a long time they

01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:42,710
mail start bouncing we will make an

01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,320
attempt to contact you by other means

01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:50,050
yeah so what civil di mio team you will

01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:50,050
try but if you don't find them let's go

01:02:55,390 --> 01:03:08,270
they're still interested in helping an

01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:10,300
answer evil is easy what what you mean

01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:12,740
are there there there still active

01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,000
semi-active on the team adult as much as

01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,770
they should be there acted within the

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,869
community but not necessarily the team

01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:23,119
ride someone gross yeah separately

01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:25,990
encourage that we encourage the teams to

01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,790
trim out there dead weight per se I

01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:31,190
think most most of them do I don't think

01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:34,490
we have a process for that NW actually

01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:37,099
we don't and maybe we should because the

01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:46,150
Pearl team has probably 150 members some

01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:46,150
of these mostly 30 yeah oh yeah

01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:54,250
active Kevin well I think the son of

01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:57,579
thing is pretty easy to quantify this as

01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:59,380
you can see I would like with the New

01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:01,000
York so I can see that you making

01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:04,809
commits to the infrastructure repository

01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,059
the controls comes so should we sum up

01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:12,460
maybe take one more question and finish

01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:14,289
up some people can get some babies what

01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:19,260
will be the most important lesson for a

01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:21,779
new distinguishes that's a good question

01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:25,269
are we going to take five minutes

01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:27,700
actually think first and stopped because

01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:30,099
many is reduces probably started by just

01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,440
one guy or two guys just start with

01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,180
something and then it grew and it grew

01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,250
and grew and in the end you end up with

01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,019
a pile of packages and a pile of in

01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,910
storage it worked on some people and

01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:42,609
nothing is organizing you sit down drop

01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:44,980
your don't know doc you remember your

01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:47,680
process nothing is documented nothing's

01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:49,390
organized than you think now it doesn't

01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,640
work anymore it's just stuck in system

01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:54,190
in some kind of a dead log base so you

01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,140
just have to think how do we do it then

01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,119
do it and let's just say la let's start

01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,490
by choosing a package format let's start

01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,109
by choosing some basic package of the

01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,970
start and then basically what you're

01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:05,829
saying is you needed plan in we get a

01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,319
plan I guess is you need a concrete plan

01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:09,940
how do I organize my distribution

01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:11,529
because certainly we had that problem

01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,849
that was wasn't got one guy showing I

01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:15,910
did more people and more people in more

01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:17,559
people and suddenly the founder of the

01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:19,210
project in the main lead and the only

01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:22,630
one who had ruled excess on every server

01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:24,819
suddenly went to bed m.i.a distribution

01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,109
was basically dead for so there was a

01:05:24,819 --> 01:05:27,369
package and work there were no new

01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:29,259
releases they were not was nothing

01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:31,329
really new for over a year and still

01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:33,220
until he came down and said well I don't

01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:35,049
have time for anything just someone else

01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,849
do it and then we started well we need

01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:38,440
some processes we need some things and

01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:40,450
rather it was i think it was in two

01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,069
thousand five after four years or maybe

01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:45,849
two thousand six after five years and

01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:48,039
maybe that's a bit late another thing to

01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:50,660
think of automation early because it's

01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:53,480
easy to easy to do Susan the Treasury

01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:55,070
as soon as many machines you're

01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,750
completely law that it's just easy to

01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:58,430
set up automation when you have 10

01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,470
machines and it's much harder when you

01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:01,610
have to get the has more automation when

01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:02,810
you already whether the shoes are all

01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,950
running because they might look

01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:06,440
completely different from that what

01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,720
you're running at the moment they will

01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:12,320
look very they don't know what your dad

01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,540
I want to be positive what that well the

01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,220
thing is if you don't your automation in

01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:19,400
the beginning then your machines will

01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:21,950
diverge they will accumulate differences

01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,510
and when you implement automation when

01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:26,060
not if when you will eventually

01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:27,260
implement operation you need to work way

01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,870
those differences and that makes an

01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:31,220
order even with automation I guarantee

01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:32,900
you oh yeah they are things you're going

01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:35,090
to miss that again carry on diverge to

01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,620
true not only super is easy it's easier

01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:38,300
to two to Drew prayer because I repaired

01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:41,030
in a central point yes we've met on the

01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,980
machine so you have to notice it so I

01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:46,190
guess documentation because someone

01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:50,870
mentioned first recommendation is yellow

01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:53,840
not real documentation truly is inviting

01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:57,530
us Mary Brockovich its processes yes yes

01:06:53,840 --> 01:07:05,300
indeed on that note maybe we'll conclude

01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:08,530
the round table thanks very much yes so

01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,530
