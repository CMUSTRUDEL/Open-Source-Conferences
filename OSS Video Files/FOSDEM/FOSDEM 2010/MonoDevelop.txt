Title: MonoDevelop
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Lluis Sahnchez Gual

MonoDevelop is an open source IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio to Linux and to maintain a single code base for all platforms.

In this talk, I'll show the features of the recently released MonoDevelop 2.2, and a sneak peak of what we are planning for the next release. It will be a practical session with examples of how to use and extend MonoDevelop.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

stop it good morning and you sanchez and

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,920
i'm the lead developer of monodevelop

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:17,730
and today I'm going to talk a bit about

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,160
the project I'm going to give a quick

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,850
review of the features that monitor the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,710
middle monodevelop has and in other

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:33,239
religions we have known and I will show

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:36,770
what features that the new release we

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,469
should just did unless the same but has

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:44,180
and what are planning for the next

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:49,200
release which would be to god for so

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:53,010
first of all a quick review of what have

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,699
we been doing until now the first stable

00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,750
release of monodevelop was like much

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:03,090
2008 it was a very release very focused

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,489
to gtk shot development so what we

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:11,610
wanted to do is ID for the burping no

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:16,500
map lakay shins so we have a very strong

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,470
super for C sharp and basic support for

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,619
other languages we had some basic

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,740
refactoring operations we have some

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:31,950
initial support for loading Visual

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:35,130
Studio Projects and we had quite a lot

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,460
of audience for version control for

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,700
packaging generating tarballs generating

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,509
make files for and you need for testing

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,100
and for localization so after all what

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,780
we wanted with his release was to be

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,560
self-hosting so we could use mana

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,540
develop to build model ipod self and in

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,090
that the whole development cycle from

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,180
the older phases of development

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:13,190
so we did that and then s release was

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:18,900
like one year later maybe should close

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:24,840
the door and stay so the next release

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,930
was like one year later and we were

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,840
listening or our users what so what they

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:36,000
demanded the most demanded the feature

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:40,940
was the debugger so we did the debugger

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,940
we integrated the mana mana d'ivoire MDB

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:50,220
we also improve the code editor the text

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,980
editor what we did was to move to a new

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,100
text editor which is a managed text

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,620
editor fully implemented on C sharp this

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,270
allowed us to add some advanced features

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,320
like controlling the speed bill and

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:10,830
incremental search and other features

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:13,110
and we also improved out our our super

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,950
for visual studio in fact what we did is

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,160
to to change our project service so we

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,340
can now use we are actually using the

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,310
busy visual studio file format the MSB

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:32,130
l5 format as a native format for our

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:34,019
projects and win win a super we saw that

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,450
the latest visual studio version for

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:41,670
that and we also improve many other

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,420
areas of malaya velop like we introduced

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,000
a sheltie super we had multi selection

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,750
in the solution pad we could do

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,390
operations on several files at once we

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,610
had go to file common base of very

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,290
useful command for energy for navigating

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,360
on the source code and the same

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,360
direction and other stuff

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,739
the last stable release we have done is

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:13,280
to the two which was released on this

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,079
and last December and the main focus of

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:23,060
that release was to to reach a wider

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:26,270
audience I or Treat a wider user base so

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,750
we wanted monodevelop to be a fool to

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:37,130
more users so we just decided to focus

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:38,630
on make it multi-platform and so in this

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,160
alice is that the first that we

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:47,120
officially support windows and mac and

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,720
target platforms we are so introduce the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,520
new soft debugger that monodevelop has

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,550
now so we integrated it in monodevelop

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,250
and there is also the roads also this

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,580
iphone Aldean which allows development

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:09,740
of iphone applications and another

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:13,340
change with it is to remove the GPL code

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,789
we had remaining so we could change the

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,280
license to a more to a license with

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:23,120
hello implementing a Deans which are not

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:28,580
GPL compatible so monodevelop is now

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:32,300
lgpl and a lot of credit goes to the MOJ

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,500
guys which helped a lot on on rewriting

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:42,289
some of the sabbatical and we also

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:47,440
improved a lot of things in the text

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:50,270
editor we had a new the factoring and

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,010
infrastructure which allows us to

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:57,800
implement new refactoring operations we

00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:02,240
had two other Connie going help us like

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:07,740
go template with placeholders we had the

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,080
new code formatting engine for

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,250
formatting the source code 40 sharp

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,960
together with what we call formatting

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,150
policies which allows specifying

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,160
settings for formatting at project level

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:30,220
we had new code code generation

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:34,020
operations the customer configuration

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:38,560
mode which I am going to show now and a

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:42,130
whole bunch of new audience like the NBC

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,990
adding for asp.net moonlighted in Python

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:49,600
summit then whatever already available

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,320
in previous releases but in beta with

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,580
say not support state in this version

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,580
did what they were released

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,389
ok so I'm going to show some of those

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,389
features

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:26,060
so as I was saying one of the main

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,890
changes in this last release was too is

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,660
that we know official support Windows

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:38,870
and Mac well I don't have here Mac or

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:41,270
Windows to show but we had to make some

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,350
changes in monitoring monodevelop tool

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:48,770
to adapt to those platforms in Mac what

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,990
we did because our goal was to make one

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,570
of the veloped feel more native to those

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,670
platform so for example monodevelop what

00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:01,310
we did was to use to change the world

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:05,750
wench and so the it would use the main

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:09,250
menu of macros so good it would show

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:13,010
like a native application we change the

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:19,070
shortcut of the comments so you could

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:22,640
use more mac family shortcuts and we

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:27,440
even adapt the behavior of the text

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,040
editor so it would be hit like mac text

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,039
editors because they have some specific

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:37,310
ways of Navy navigating the code and

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,680
what's bathing and so on so it's we try

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:48,530
to make it more feel more native talk to

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:51,020
to Mac in the windows case we did more

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,910
or less the same well in fact this we

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,380
don't we don't have to change some of

00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:01,460
the duties deep changes but we only have

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,700
to apply for example a que binding set

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,660
which it's more like visual studio so

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:12,740
people can choose it but one of the

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:16,600
things that we had to do is make it

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,600
possible to use

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,730
the microsoft.net framework or the and

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,980
users welder the mono framework for

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,890
development because I know when you

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,080
install one of the volokh on Windows it

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,780
is going to run on top of microsoft.net

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:36,610
it is not going to install mono by

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:39,430
default and but you can use as well ma

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,530
know if you want to develop later on so

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,360
what do we need is to introduce a new

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,920
concept the concept of drone time it

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,990
said the monodevelop we already had the

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,210
concept of target framework so you can

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,310
develop an application and say ok this

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,790
this application is going to target the

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,860
to that Oh framework which has a set of

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,350
feature set of specifying assemblies or

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,040
it is going to target the sizzle fight

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,930
framework but let's say orthogonal do

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,330
this this this that the room time you

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:17,830
want to choose to build that application

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:20,470
and who need so here in the the toolbar

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,390
there is a in addition to the

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,960
configuration you want the user to test

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:28,810
an application there is a list of

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,580
framework which are installing in the in

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,260
the machine so you can select which

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,150
frame were you want to use or building

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,150
an executive that application in this

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,250
case all of them are parallel mono

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,160
installations on windows case it would

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:47,370
show microsoft.net framework or mono

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:56,830
framework ok so i can choose any of them

00:10:47,370 --> 00:11:00,940
and also what I we had to in the window

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:04,089
sched we had to implement the specific a

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,700
deal for debugging so this is a divine

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,190
backend specific for windows win32

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,830
debugger and these are so again for the

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,830
subversion adine which is using sharp is

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:21,470
Vienna's spoken

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:24,040
so what else yeah well about the the

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:29,360
framework about the runtimes it is also

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,850
this room with comment here which is new

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,590
this menu which also allows to run an

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,080
application on a specific frame were so

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,690
you may be are developing using makes up

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,150
the net and building on microsoft net

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,950
and you decide to try it on on wind on

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:52,780
mono then you can just do a room with

00:11:44,950 --> 00:12:00,880
and select here the framework valentine

00:11:52,780 --> 00:12:07,700
this menu here is what it lists here are

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:10,580
execution mode so these are different

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,720
ways of running an application it in

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:17,060
this is an extensible menu so a Deans

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,330
can add new execution modes here this

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,990
also new offer to the top and right now

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,730
there are some some mode like turning an

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,700
application with custom parameters or

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,910
using some specific frame water using

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,850
the debugger and if i use for example

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,190
kristen pregnant heirs i can decide to

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,500
run this application with some arguments

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,590
using some working directory or some

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,700
environment variable it is also a mano

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:50,120
options tab which allows me to set a lot

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:53,510
of room time mono runtime specific

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,730
options which you would usually set

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,160
using the command line features or

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:03,110
environment variables that you can set

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,150
them here and you can run this

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,350
application is using those settings and

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,820
you cannot so save this is specific

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,270
those are specific parameters and give

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,270
it a name

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,440
and say okay this is going to be stored

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:26,540
for this project and I bring it so from

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,240
now on when I go to the room with menu I

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,839
can see this mode here so I can reuse it

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,570
for such several executions so what's

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,250
interesting about that is that this mode

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,770
list here is available on several and on

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,950
every feature of the mana wat which may

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:50,290
even assembly so for example if happen

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,290
in unit tests like here

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:04,940
I could do okay run this test with any

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,940
of those mods here okay which by the way

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:17,670
ok it it is not showing because I can go

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,500
to edit coastal modes and I said this

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:25,050
mod is only for this project so i can

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:33,020
change it and make it global and should

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:33,020
should show now be

00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:47,140
so the other feature star feature of

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:49,150
this release was the sub debugger this

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,910
of the world is the gnu debugger we had

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:58,030
money develop it was developed

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,890
specifically or mainly for the to give

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,470
super to the iphone Nadine so we could

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,470
debug iPhone applications and

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,660
monodevelop has a debugging service as

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,390
backing infrastructure and all we did is

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,590
to implement a new backing for this new

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:20,650
debugger so from the point of view of

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:25,450
the user i'm using the soft debugger or

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:27,250
the MDV de ole develop monodevelop it

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:31,060
makes no difference in the in the GUI

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,800
because it's using the same GUI but in

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,960
addition to implementing that the back

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,490
the back end for the subdiv are actively

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,990
we are we keep improving the the GUI so

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:46,140
in this release we added some new

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,140
features like Michelle

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:57,580
is the immediate window which allows me

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,470
to implement I to execute some some

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,320
comment like for example let's see

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:13,500
what's the wind variable or see the name

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:22,600
or i can define some variables as well

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:28,290
or do some basic operations evaluations

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,650
of expressions we also added some

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:43,120
options some new options which are

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:47,230
available in the preferences so for

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,890
example this is a new option for when

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,290
one set it is going only to step into

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,390
libraries which are part of the solution

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,490
so it is not going to spin to step into

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,970
system-wide values on or external

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:04,830
libraries I can set that this is also a

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:09,370
flag for enable enabling or disabling

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:12,600
implicit evaluation of properties so for

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,600
example if i disable that

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,870
oops

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:30,150
now you can see that the the properties

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,010
are not showing the value and the if I

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,710
want to see it I have to click on the

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,480
drive flesh Bhutan so this is useful

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,420
when we are to debugging complex

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,850
applications and we don't have to to

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,850
have side effects while debugging

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,830
because in order to show the value of

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,910
monodevelop has to query the value of

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,970
the property so this is going to may

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,640
affect the target process we are

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,059
debugging I have in my have side effects

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:06,230
sorry sometimes it may be useful to to

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:12,710
enable this and there were are also

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:15,780
options for the way the members of the

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,990
objects reaction has to be doped we can

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,600
group them for accessibility and for

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,700
base class or because the base class

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,870
members are shown in a different group

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,660
and things like that these are also an

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:34,230
evaluation timeout option here in case

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:37,790
it ain't try things out and this also

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:41,220
this preferred debugger list here so

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,440
since monodevelop has several debugging

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,010
backends you can choose here the purity

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,900
of of the back end so if you want to

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,260
make sure that when position when

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,360
passing at five for debugging to use the

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,590
sub developed and you can lower the

00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,910
bigger not to make disable the debugger

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,910
more pirate I ok

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:22,620
about the vectoring operations or god

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,900
help our operations code and we had a

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:31,040
whole bunch of new refactoring

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:35,940
operations which are oops what was that

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:41,730
okay so for example went by clicking on

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:44,570
on the coat i have this menu here I can

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:51,660
do integrate temporary variable which

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:55,230
integrate this one this is also extract

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:59,580
method like a log log log kow these also

00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:03,780
the inline rename so if I I montes by a

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:13,280
walk here and I pass rename it renames

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:13,280
life on the text editor there is also

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,990
what's that

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:28,010
some documentation exception I don't

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:30,500
know is that anyway this is also the the

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:33,440
coordination common which is a context

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,860
for comment so if i press out insert it

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,120
shows a set of options like for example

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:47,120
i want to generate property accessor for

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:48,680
this field or i want to generate to

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,260
string implementation which shows the

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:58,070
value of this property ok we're going to

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:01,970
generate over right some method from the

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:05,870
base class it is going to generate the

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:13,720
code for that and if I'm inside the

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:17,590
method I can for example both the call

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,590
generate a bright line call

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:37,670
what generator no check over there okay

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:42,080
and finally this is the new attack code

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:45,860
formatting engine and there is that also

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:49,160
this new from a document common which is

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,890
going to format the dough coming based

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,190
on a set of formatting settings which I

00:21:51,890 --> 00:22:04,010
can set for the project so if I go to

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:13,790
the project include formatting I can set

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:15,950
a lot of formatting options but for the

00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,950
for this specific project law for the

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,770
art solution level etc so this is nice

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,840
because to have not global settings but

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,860
project the specific settings which are

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,660
stored in the project file itself so

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,390
future checking the project and version

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,300
control and everybody is using this

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,750
project you will have the same settings

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:41,450
and those settings are used for but for

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,490
this format in common but also for when

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:47,150
when a new file is created using a

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:51,380
template or for code generation as well

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:56,000
and we have on the fly formatting

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:58,400
options option which is not fully

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,190
functional yet but the idea is that when

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,720
you are typing and the fly you is going

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,080
to format when you close a blog or

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,080
whatever

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:16,350
okay so for the next release to the fore

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:26,590
we have two main goals one of them is to

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:28,600
improve the usability of monodevelop we

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,570
have we we think that there are some

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,030
features some ways of working with mal

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,040
develop which can be improved and it can

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:40,480
be they can be made but these are

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,520
friendly and you want to also make it

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,430
more improve the integration of

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,770
different platforms so it looks even

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:55,140
more native to any of the platform is

00:23:47,770 --> 00:24:00,610
report we support we plant also to

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:04,300
improve our super 4x build which means M

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:08,680
SPL projects we are using right now the

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:12,010
MS bill format X build is the MS bill

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,140
implementation of mono but we are only

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,410
using the form and we are not using ms

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:21,850
below x bill to build a project so we

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:26,430
plan to support that we keep improving

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:29,350
the text editor so we are going to have

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:32,740
what they are completion groups which

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,870
loops inside the completion window have

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,310
better a speed on a completion and other

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:41,200
improvements while native file dialog

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:44,500
dialogues about what the voice I know

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,200
about platform tation we plan to provide

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,720
when you click on open file and it will

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,640
show that open file dialog which is

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,570
native to the platform instead of

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,950
showing the gtk one and keep improving

00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,950
the d buyer

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:26,490
ok this one so well what I'm showing

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:30,510
here is it's not that I in in svn it's a

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:33,390
an experimental branch which I have and

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,930
where I'm trying some some changes in

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:39,510
the GUI and explain venting amick with

00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:47,910
it and tie in to get some feedback so

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:51,440
it's not final at all so as you can see

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:55,440
some of the changes and these are more

00:25:51,440 --> 00:26:01,790
sherry brown bag back down here with the

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,790
dot pats motivated to the background

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,760
so you can see here wat chedi it is also

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:26,060
a new status bar which makes a more

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,980
smart use of space of example when I

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,000
minimize one of the bat it is going to

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:41,450
minimize next to the status bar so we

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:46,460
can save a row of space here also some

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:53,020
other changes we have done and going to

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:53,020
compile this but with some some errors

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,750
so I build the project and as you can

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,730
see there are these ever bubbles what

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:11,559
you call it ever bubbles which show the

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:17,080
compelling errors in line in the in the

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:20,490
text editor and I can browse through

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:27,000
them quickly without having to show the

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:30,250
error list okay the results to this

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,480
panel here which shows information about

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:39,970
the build errors and warnings and well

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm also playing with the this idea of

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:46,390
pop-up panel here which allows me to do

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,210
some context specific occasions like

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:53,290
show me the first error or show me the

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:56,740
error lists okay browse to it or short

00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:01,530
shoulder and the build-out put the of

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,530
the build operation okay

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:10,929
also another change related to this is

00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:14,950
that if I do a examine Sebastian

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:20,940
operation like chicken that changes in

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,940
this project or whatever or update and

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:27,460
in previous model developed bastions

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,649
when I velop used to always pop up an

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,610
output window and show all the result of

00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:37,000
the operation here and it is not popping

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,809
up the window anymore by default but

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,940
instead to do it I have to click on the

00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:46,510
on the result of the operation so I can

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,730
also go here and the end click on show

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,970
me the log for the last operation and

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:57,490
the same actually the same is true also

00:28:51,970 --> 00:29:01,360
for when I the project and I can also go

00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:05,559
here and see the log or see on involved

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,250
to show the release so what I'm dying

00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:12,010
here is to apply this concept to several

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:18,460
operations like the one I shown and also

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:22,139
when I do for example finding files

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,139
operation looking for a text

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:30,260
so I can show some information sighs

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,310
light show me the log for this search

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,310
operation and he'll that

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:46,509
and there is also ball this is more

00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:48,879
history window so I can see all the

00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:51,970
pleasures I done until now one review of

00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:59,889
lots of all values from other patients

00:29:51,970 --> 00:30:02,769
so we can have a better deal right this

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:05,559
is a history of the sum of the person

00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:09,600
I've done so I can review the lock of

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,600
previous operations okay

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,220
huh

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:32,760
also we have new some nice features in

00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,760
the debugger

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:44,590
so this application i'm using here is a

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,300
very simple ddk application choose a

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:52,060
window with a good one when i click on

00:30:46,300 --> 00:31:00,870
it it starts the counter okay so

00:30:52,060 --> 00:31:03,750
something very easy so i have this click

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:07,540
event handler which starts on time out

00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:09,730
so every half a second is going to

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:18,960
increase this counter and update the

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:22,840
label so if i set a big point here i can

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,460
hover over it and now there is a dis new

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:31,800
pin boot on here so when I click on it

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:36,310
this gets docked to the text editor and

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:39,460
it can show the the values of the of

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:43,000
this guy over here you can see the

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:48,610
pitting it when I step this is starting

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:53,790
the user setting so it's it's persistent

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,790
if I close it and they will open oops

00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,680
well I should show well I did that

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:17,990
okay I know what's happening one second

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:21,020
I have to speak do this lesson here

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,550
because that the bank i have I was

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:27,940
trying now it doesn't have the latest

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:27,940
changes from tank so I have to use them

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,410
the trunk person

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:56,480
ok

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:58,970
so I close the open here this so what it

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,430
does is every time the democracy started

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,680
to bolivar it's all of those floating

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:10,700
watches and updates the the values and

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:15,380
the text editor okay and another thing i

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:19,930
am miss P and trying to when I explained

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:26,840
with me experimenting with is to have

00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:28,970
live life watches in editor so here this

00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,360
is a new button when you click on it it

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,130
is going to be a life watch so if I now

00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,090
I continue the execution of the

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:43,870
application it is going to update like

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,870
the the values on the on the text editor

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,340
so you could have table watches set

00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:56,030
around when you open the file you can

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,970
see the values of the of the variable

00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:01,340
which will have the value of the last

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:06,470
time you that the code went through

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:20,290
there so it's completely oops okay some

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:20,290
nice thing thank you

00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:31,349
see ya sorry well it is showing a

00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:41,290
description of the object I mean if it

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,210
is going to buy full it is going to show

00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:48,970
the name of the class okay but I mean

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,520
the debugger supports different display

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,379
options of about that object has a

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,540
two-string implementation is going to

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:58,599
show the value of the string for that

00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:01,359
object or you're not you can apply soap

00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:11,680
some debug despite attributes to the

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:13,930
object so you could set an expression to

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,970
be shown for that object so the job

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,849
object has three properties you could

00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,440
say okay show me first probability then

00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:24,599
sliced and the second popular whatever

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,599
okay of course you can also

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:41,060
pin one member of the of the absorb

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:54,410
jacket instead of the object is help

00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:59,030
okay this case fix no not the problem is

00:35:54,410 --> 00:36:01,730
that well well maybe it's I don't know

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,160
that this said the promise that inferred

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,250
for the genetics collection this is this

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,020
a bug who has to be one not about but

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,020
that feature which has to be implemented

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,170
in the South devour because in the in

00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,650
the collections about the device to

00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:23,720
create an instead of a generic object

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:27,950
providing some some type argument and

00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,020
add to it to be able to instantiate that

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:35,420
pipe and this is not just reported on

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:37,790
but the Sultan is is going to and for a

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:41,590
least I don't remember it that is going

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,590
to work but I can sign

00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:08,579
because i don't know if the second

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:19,520
yes this case it is working so its own

00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:22,970
County one because one okay so you can

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:29,170
see here the values and then see the

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:32,170
govie what array list yeah yeah

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,170
Stephanie

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,790
hmm

00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:51,240
well this pretty much it they are some

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:58,270
other as I said improvement like least

00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:02,500
oops blue coat groups in the completion

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:05,140
list so you PES shift down but maybe you

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,580
are not seeing this but these are

00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,760
thoroughly fixing drunk I don't have

00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:12,450
latest what here is what he's doing is

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,920
group the members by in class name so

00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:19,690
instead of showing a very long list of

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,339
members for the for complex classic it

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,190
is going to show them load byte class

00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:33,070
name so you can quickly browse through

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:37,420
all the members of the class and there's

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:41,830
also this bowl a blog selection oops oh

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:45,640
I can I shall we dine oh okay this is

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:48,970
the Block C election with out and move

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:53,230
the mouse but I have this binding set

00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:54,849
here so I cannot show it now but it is

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:59,349
nice in this version because it allows

00:38:54,849 --> 00:39:01,690
typing takes at seven lines at one so

00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:05,430
you can select our column and type and

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,430
it's going to type in all the columns

00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,490
and those are the main changes we are

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,260
planning for to God for one of the

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,380
things we plan to do is to shorten the

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,580
release time of the of monodevelop and

00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:22,930
instead of spending one year making

00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,210
adding a lot of features we plan to

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:29,140
shorten the release maybe add less

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:31,480
features but more frequent releases so

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,890
okay so that's all if you have any

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:39,260
question yes we should

00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,720
look at development month ago allow

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,770
officials to the airport and I notice

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,510
right away that there is a big

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:49,870
difference in color syntax highlighter

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,870
visual CEO also highlights class names

00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:00,320
that Zonda planned yeah there are some

00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,110
changes we have to do in the in our see

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,380
shop super in the city our parser which

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:09,290
is going to allow to do this kind of

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,330
thing because we have some we need some

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,750
context to a location information that

00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:22,210
we don't don't get from the pasture and

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:22,210
we are working on that yeah sorry

00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,190
well sooner or later he will come I mean

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:43,730
as soon as smaller switches to get it

00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:47,690
really matter of of taste and bring our

00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:51,410
self hosting again working and they even

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:54,579
have a gift k the folded edge browser

00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:59,690
history there's even a geek capers

00:40:54,579 --> 00:41:02,150
implemented with OTP I they know windows

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,740
only that you I you know other on the

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:08,119
way here the plan and of thinking about

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:11,420
the money to get sharper like I didn't

00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:18,579
do it such as the working there and it

00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:18,579
supports ssh you know it's pretty much

00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:26,490
so it's not only takes out a volunteer

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,190
to do that yeah I'm probably going to

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:39,930
switch manos it's about two or three

00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:54,470
months any other question I photo

00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:54,470
