hi everyone so I want this session to be

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,400
quite interactive I'm going to try and

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,429
get you folks to do a bit of work here

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,970
so the doors there if you want to escape

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:19,920
quick so my name is Andrew and two

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,550
things you need to know about me if you

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,510
want in the talk I did earlier on how to

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,439
contact me to send me questions flames

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,300
bug fixes whatever second thing is I'm

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,420
open-source manager for the limo

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,920
foundation hands up who knows what limo

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,950
foundation is okay all right so what

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,739
limo foundation is a an organization

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,309
that's creating a middleware open source

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,860
Linux platform for mobile phones and

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:55,949
it's been going since 2007 it's got a

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,190
very diverse membership across the

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,980
entire ecosystem of across the entire

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,379
mobile ecosystem including chipset

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,049
manufacturers like texas instruments and

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,640
set manufacturers like NEC panasonic

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:17,450
samsung LG software companies like opera

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:23,400
mozilla network operators like vodafone

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:26,430
orange and so on however everything i

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,530
say in this room entirely my own ideas

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,689
my own thing nothing to do with limo um

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:42,899
so hands up how many of you've got a

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:44,180
linux-based mobile phone okay yeah so

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,620
most handy

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:53,540
he had a linux-based mobile phone this

00:01:45,620 --> 00:02:01,700
time last year you before that okay

00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:03,560
before that hardcore no okay all right

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,610
so limo foundations actually been around

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,959
since 2007 and some of our members have

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,789
actually got experience of building

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,490
linux-based phones going back to two

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,340
thousand two or so but of course it's

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,640
not the only linux based mobile distro

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,709
out there there are a few others but

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,130
it's still a relatively sparse landscape

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,080
compared to the desktop linux world

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,820
where you've got seemingly hundreds of

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,739
distributions this is pretty much what

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,400
you've got in terms of mobile or mobile

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:39,830
based distributions at the moment de

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,120
know if I've missed anybody anyone feel

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:48,950
free to shout out if I have missed

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:50,630
anything obvious but everyone seems to

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,670
be building mobile distributions and

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,830
it's a bit strange why there are so few

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,370
mobile distributions out there perhaps

00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,630
it's it's hardware based normal than

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,489
your builder destroy it's just kind of

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,900
like building Lego you can take bits

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,940
from here and there and put it together

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,769
but an in actual fact if you look at the

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,660
number platform we've kind of taken

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,070
things from here and there if you look

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:18,620
at no mobile we've borrowed quite

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:20,959
heavily from that some of the challenges

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,200
that we face though in building a Linux

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
mobile distribution like to find the

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,100
latest release of the open source code

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,989
that we want to use and in some cases

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,180
where to find an older release of the

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,549
open source code that we use and when

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,590
you're building mobile phone platforms

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,390
you're typically building them over

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,000
typically building mobile found over the

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:45,760
course of a couple of years so if you

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,079
think back to 10 2007 2008 and I'm

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,430
that's the code that is probably going

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,430
to be in a lot of mobile phones today

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,900
finding the source code is is a

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,520
challenge and finding the license that

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,620
covers the source code is is a very big

00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,570
challenge and actually making sure that

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,060
you can plant with the licenses is a bit

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,060
of a problem from the mobile perspective

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,940
another challenge is reference hardware

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,500
from both the platform developer point

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,600
of view but also from an open-source

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,850
developer point of view and I had a

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,350
question in an earlier talk which was

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,540
basically you know where is the open

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,690
hardware to go with the open operating

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,080
system no one really apart from open

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,490
moco have produced open hardware so

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,370
you're not likely to see an open piece

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,630
of hardware from perhaps Samsung or any

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,130
seal Panasonic anytime soon so how can

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,650
you build a software platform if you

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,380
don't have the hardware to build on and

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,640
how can you make the phone hardware if

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,920
you don't have the software it's a real

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,110
chicken and egg situation one solution

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,770
might be to look at things like bigger

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,060
board although one of the problems that

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,330
I've found is they can actually be quite

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,710
tricky to track down so first several

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,720
weeks when I was trying to get hold of

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,130
one the websites where i was trying to

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,990
order them from continually saying

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,220
they're backordered and you'll have to

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,350
wait and in perfect timing for this

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:18,440
session my beagle board ship to me today

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,670
which is not big help if you had left

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,380
hand side well how do you actually get

00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,970
it to the right developers how do we say

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,950
okay we know the open source community

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,570
are going to build a mobile distribution

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,370
who in the community should actually

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,190
have the reference hardware how can we

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,900
identify them any suggestions I'm you

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,520
know happy to hear them package

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,470
management when you're building a mobile

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,150
platform what should you do in terms of

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,420
package management should you use you

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,490
know the Debian packaging the the RPM

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,530
the Red Hat packaging should you just

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:56,540
have tar.gz Ed's of all of your platform

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:58,880
so in yeah so we've seen in none in nemo

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,610
we've seen pretty much every possible

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,400
packaging mechanism being used that you

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,860
could imagine so

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,440
we've actually seen a platform delivered

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,780
with all of the packaging mechanisms

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,400
simultaneously in use which is a bit

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:18,729
bizarre so that's what I want to get you

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,310
guys to talk about or to talk to me

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,590
about is what we should be doing in

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,630
terms of a mobile distribution should

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,990
should there be a mobile distribution or

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:33,400
should it just be another aspect of

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,660
Debian or or fedora for example do you

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:46,260
think there should be a separate mobile

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:46,260
distribution did someone say no why not

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,000
so sure

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,680
so a lot of the things that distribution

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,560
does is policy based and for a mobile

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,910
phone the policy is going to be

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,250
different for just about every handset

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,139
that gets created so it's useful to have

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,919
a base distribution perhaps but it's a

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:20,490
lot more useful to have a system where

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,080
it's easier to create a distribution so

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,990
the distribution build tools like

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,220
openembedded whereby you can define a

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,410
distribution you've got base

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,960
configuration based policy and then

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,320
people could building these mobile

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,760
phones can just build on top of that

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,300
that's me you know that's my opinion but

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:44,460
having a had red hat based extrusion or

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:48,060
a debian based distribution is perhaps

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,960
overkill for a mobile phone okay I

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,199
overkill in in in what way in what sense

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,860
because a mobile phone doesn't need all

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,610
of those packages or or its yeah the the

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,400
use cases are very specific on a you

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:11,220
know depending on the vendor and even

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,750
the network operator so the policy

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,360
varies so much to this more useful just

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,820
to be able to create a distribution

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,070
easily than it is to have a distribution

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,260
to strip down from so it's like building

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,710
blocks starting up rather than stripping

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,340
down all that like so my opinion okay

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:35,969
all right I'm saying on agree with that

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:49,230
disagree with that well oh go for it

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:53,520
Dave yeah this is what mean what about

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,240
done yeah should anyone else be focusing

00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,320
on anything

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,630
really true yeah one of the problems

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,910
with with focusing on mobile devices is

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:10,500
that you can't just boys it's a lot

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,820
harder to sort of build you can't build

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,800
on the device you've got to build on

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,540
your own on your desktop and then port

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,209
stuff across so mmm well you could

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,130
develop entirely or you could develop

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,430
entirely on the n900 for example but

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:36,180
compilation might take a while I guess

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:39,860
so yeah I was thinking that would be

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:55,860
quite handy today actually so yeah so um

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:57,270
Dave I one of the issues I think that

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,250
mobile distributions are going to have

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,020
is that specifically limo is that a

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,339
significant chunk of the platform is not

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,930
fully redistributable by the users and

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,579
until you address addition to the

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:16,550
prospect of a successful mobile

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:19,440
community distribution is Leonard I

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,500
would say so what do you think that how

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,120
are you thinking about that issue of

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:31,440
trying to make something that you can

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:34,880
that your users can redistribute um yeah

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
okay thanks for that question

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,200
so no you're quite right that a

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,410
semi-closed platform is is harder to

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:54,570
redistribute I guess the the question

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:56,400
there is do we need to redistribute the

00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,540
the platform to the users or just the

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,610
people developing the devices but there

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,860
are certainly huge chunks of well

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,440
seventy percent plus of the lemma

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,700
platform is open source so if we're just

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,110
working with those open source

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,930
components and forgetting about the

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,610
closed or proprietary components for the

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:40,890
time being what would we need to do to

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:42,510
make that happen yeah yeah yeah I mean I

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,340
don't disagree there were enormous

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,760
benefits to having an entirely open

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,470
platform for sure but this is more

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,440
rather than looking at limo specifically

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,610
in a mobile platform in general what are

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,860
the sorts of things that we should be

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,140
should be looking at so there's

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,040
discussion of sort of a policy based

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:15,870
approach whether it should be stripped

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:18,830
down or not so you wanna just hang on

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,830
for the microphone

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,500
because this week week and I'm not the

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,540
core developer on SH our distribution

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,210
that is working for open market but I

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,990
participate to a bit and I write a

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,030
rotten identica plication for it so

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,550
basically what i would say there is that

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,990
how can that be a question of course you

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,780
want it to be really suitable for

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,370
everyone because the inventions will not

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,710
come from a centralized or from the

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,470
vendors but from every free software

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,150
developer all over the world that can

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,310
actually build an application so

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,130
basically to me that is not a question

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:04,420
it's a matter of fact and everything

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:07,330
otherwise will just result in I pace yep

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,160
yeah I actually completely agree and

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,910
this is where the I'm not speaking for

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,970
my employ a bit kicks in so as an

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,170
open-source person I totally agree if

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,270
you want the platform to be widely

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,090
adopted it has to be open and if you

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,640
want to benefit from you know innovation

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:32,110
and bug fixes and so on it has to be

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:35,020
open so okay so open this is a given

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,670
requirement for a mobile platform so

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,050
moving on from that and there are other

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,990
things that we should be seeing in a

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:45,480
mobile platform so I'm losing my voice

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,480
and anyone

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,020
so should the mobile platform be posted

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:01,300
by an existing distribution do you think

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,380
should it be a you know debian or fedora

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:17,800
or or should it be an entirely separate

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:19,750
effort no opinions okay yeah actually

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:31,120
that's a fair question why are there so

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:35,890
few mobile distributions yeah could be I

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,140
guess do you think there will be more

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,860
mobile distributions now that hardware

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:48,630
is caught up with always you know

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:51,630
sufficiently powerful to run Linux don't

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,630
okay

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,850
so there are other things that you would

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:06,780
really like to see in a an open mobile

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:08,610
platform yeah so for I speak I have a

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,290
small request can the microphones be

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,510
turned up a bit because there's a

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:18,420
consensus on IRC that we can't hear a

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:24,150
thing is it this this microphone or yeah

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:30,330
well I got the microphones and it's on

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:34,920
maximum on here fun yeah ah okay okay as

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:37,920
far as open platforms go for linux

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,620
mobile distributions 1company offenders

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,500
been doing it well recently is palm I've

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,170
saw a few people here that have the palm

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,750
pre where boys devices I have one myself

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,850
and my pocket as well yeah and I think

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,740
they are doing a good job in trying to

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,370
spearhead the effort of a completely

00:15:52,740 --> 00:16:00,060
open mobile platform because they're

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,880
well compared to other our companies for

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,740
being a bit more closed about it I

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,140
remember reading recently about Android

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,000
for example there wasn't completely open

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,120
because of certain components of the

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,710
line android developer but at least with

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,890
palm webos is using open standards

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:23,550
things like oak theo de an html5 and so

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:27,540
on just to develop the applications so

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,030
is as so on more open i think that with

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,680
companies like ours are notable were

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:36,390
probably going to start seeing an

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,480
increase and the number of linux mobile

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,850
distributions that we have them in I

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,589
didn't catch his name there he said that

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,990
there was only about 4 which was the the

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,100
for that you lasted but I do think

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,650
that's probably going to start

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:55,140
increasing present okay so would you

00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:57,430
expect them to open up their their

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,279
platform as well rolled up

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,440
nobody is very open they provide a

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,990
number of developer tools to just access

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,420
the royal linux platform that's

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,559
underlying they don't train hide behind

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,350
the api's SDKs that they provide they do

00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,910
allow you to just do you want with it

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,610
they basically provide developer tools

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,020
and see there you go have fun and we're

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:23,290
probably going to start seeing more of

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,829
that although that's more to build on

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,470
top of the the platform there's that's

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,740
not so much to actually work on the

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,440
platform itself is there so it's you

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,020
can't go and download the the palm webos

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,990
source right now and compile it yourself

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,480
and flash it onto a palm phone that's

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,120
really yeah but I'm hoping that it's

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,890
going to evolve a bit and we're going to

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,490
see like I said other companies trained

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:55,990
for suit and because Palmer taking the

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,179
first step and allowing end users to

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,280
access the operating system that the

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,160
phone is running on which is perhaps a

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,870
bit more important than developers just

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,790
accessing it because developers been

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,510
able to do that in all platforms for a

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:13,480
long time for the NGOs are to have that

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,059
much access to the role operating system

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,250
is probably going to start leading the

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,390
way to a truly open lenox mobile

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:26,190
platform ok it's a good comment actually

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,480
an interesting thing and you think the

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:32,170
the users are more interested in the

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,550
platform because of the the use of open

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:40,809
standards and the openness as probably

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,840
not many users who would consider an

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,160
open platform to be a selling point

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,380
obviously developers would consider that

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,360
to be a selling point as far as NGOs or

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,600
school at the moment they don't really

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,059
care all that much but in the mud seller

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,820
talked earlier on it was being said that

00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,740
we need to start giving users choice we

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,170
need to start informing them of their

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,780
options and that's something that can

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,039
translate over into mobile platforms as

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,799
well ok all right

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:13,710
and one of the guys there was shaking

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:18,210
his head about palm opening the code I

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:21,769
think yes I was laughing at me okay also

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,479
prefer apple Oh what's your your viewing

00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,039
well not just pan but other mobile

00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:33,869
companies opening up the source to their

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:37,799
platform so okay I'm embedded developer

00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:42,019
and so I was first impressed as a weeds

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:44,700
among the first pepper as images was

00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:46,769
available and someone look into it and

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,169
see it obvious openembedded to build

00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:53,669
hood who think so i was a little bit

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:56,039
impressed but then in but when the story

00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:00,840
goes on and as you know how I'd better

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:06,389
has to meet some pressure so we open up

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:12,059
the patches and resources you already

00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:17,369
have an open embedded because of the GPL

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:21,210
violations okay okay so on so I don't

00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:27,090
think either open some office stuff the

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:29,489
mb even don't em give us something back

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,320
open the website the only put four

00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:35,399
sources in Perpetual's we already have

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,889
and augmented it I'm sorry so so are you

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:40,229
saying that publishing the source and

00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:42,889
patches is is not enough they should do

00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:46,470
something more what what should they do

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:49,019
and I don't know about that the center's

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,080
if you can get the would show on on the

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,080
palm pre I don't know okay yeah he got

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,019
scared yeah yeah if I make it I believe

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,629
joy has also set on it put on his blog

00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,729
something about um I'm actually having a

00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:05,009
backdoor on the palm pre or something i

00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,769
don't recall the exact details but it

00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:09,210
was something nasty going on there I'm

00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,220
with with bomb doing stuff they really

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,629
should be doing and he blogged about and

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,970
it got in the press and then they

00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:17,809
changed it I don't drink all the details

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,809
but it was pretty nasty

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:24,090
to the the free smartphone the people

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:28,480
are trying to part the free smartphone

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:30,460
infrastructure to the pond the the palm

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,289
machine so basically you can use the

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,159
phone and free software stack completely

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:42,429
but it's still on infancy so we need

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:44,440
your help okay yeah so one of the things

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,139
that limo is just done is published a

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,840
list of all of the open source that

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:51,129
that's used in the limo platform and one

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,799
of the things they're starting to or we

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,409
will be starting to do is publish

00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,220
patches that is there anything further

00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:03,119
that could be done to help the open

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:07,480
source community from that point of view

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:16,330
other than opening the rest of the

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:18,450
source which is not an option Dave hang

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,450
on

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:31,680
how about helping developers working for

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:34,260
mobile companies to be better open

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,630
source citizens to be better citizens

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,330
and you know pop a little bit more

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:46,710
because in a most of the mount okay yeah

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:49,640
a great one of the challenges for mobile

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:55,200
phone companies for example is that

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,970
actually they're working on a platform

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,560
in a completely different language to

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,740
their native language although this is

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,500
something that that is a challenge in

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,770
you know open source software

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,720
development in general but if we look at

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:12,500
Samsung for example their team of all

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,870
based in Korea they will talk in Korean

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,150
we've actually seen instances where bugs

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,100
go through a system and at some point

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,810
get translated so that the development

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,280
team can deal with them and then they

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,670
get translated back into English to

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,250
report back to to the outside world so I

00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:32,370
think the the challenge with introducing

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,280
open source getting companies to be

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,620
better citizens is is actually probably

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,390
more than teaching them how to deal with

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,670
open source communities is actually a

00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,950
question of a massive language barrier

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,550
as well so I think in a lot of open

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,580
source projects english is a fairly

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,500
common commonly used language for them

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,020
that's that's just not an option and

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,290
this goes for for many of the handset

00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,980
manufacturers but yeah I take your point

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:05,370
that they need to get involved and you

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,050
want to wait for the mic sorry right

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,100
here I'm the language issues it's an

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,690
interesting question because I guess

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,740
it's one that's not limited to mobile

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:16,500
distributions any suggestions I hope

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,320
that's food for the room any suggestions

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,230
in how we can better engage african

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,650
south american and asian software

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,650
developers

00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:34,830
anyone any ideas on how we deal with the

00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:44,820
language barrier in facilitating open

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:47,759
source and open platforms so you get the

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:52,080
microphone I things I think open source

00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,489
does a lot better with that than the

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,779
most of the rest of the world we create

00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:56,369
a framework whereby people can

00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:01,200
contribute in different languages and

00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:03,389
they do I point to the project I'm best

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,970
known for apache httpd in that we've got

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:11,489
a documentation framework that wreck put

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:15,889
that encourages translations and

00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:18,239
periodically we get one then nothing I

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:24,690
hit drops of us completely out of the

00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:27,720
blue sometimes likewise if you if you

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,299
have a book you you suddenly hear on the

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,789
grapevine that someone has translated it

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:37,619
yeah and this is this is happening in

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:39,359
the world it's all it's a model not

00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,950
unlike the open source model of software

00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:45,299
that what you've written something

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,739
people will work on it yeah yes the

00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,470
actual development community happens in

00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:53,309
English which we do and which is still a

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,200
barrier I I guess what I'm trying to say

00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:59,639
is I thought about this in some depth

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,109
well know when I got someone asked out

00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:03,179
of the blue completely asked me to write

00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:05,460
would I do it and in true for the

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,820
Chinese translation of my book no I lie

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,080
and I thought so I wrote something out

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,679
what an honor it was to be translated

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,549
into such an important new language and

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,229
biggest commit probably the biggest

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:19,019
community of non-english speakers around

00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:24,389
and hoped we could bridge the gap for

00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:28,619
them yeah okay yeah so um so perhaps

00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:31,049
open this is the answer to two or one

00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:36,409
answer to solving the translation

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:36,409
troubles so I'm from open moco here

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:47,990
nope so yeah so I was just going to say

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,720
so one of the other things though is

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:54,050
that although open hardware is often

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,710
considered a prereq prerequisite for an

00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:01,010
open platform it doesn't necessarily

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:06,590
always work I guess and is it more

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:09,830
question that volume shipments or mass

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,960
consumer adoption will drive an open

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,340
platform more than the open hardware do

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,770
you think my brother I think is that

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,890
there's no software that works except

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:24,290
the middle one right i bought my open

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,150
milk with two years ago we bought a

00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,360
debian on it it's not really reporting

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,550
we adapted eben on it and still is quite

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,310
difficult to use debian on it as well as

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,870
a sea chair sometime you miss some calls

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,360
sometime the phone doesn't respond

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,850
anymore I never use anything other than

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,250
an Opel Mokka but at least the open map

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,780
is available for everyone so yeah it's

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,780
not I don't think it's a problem of the

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:50,060
platform itself they are too many too

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:55,030
many choices actually okay so that's

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,030
probably the real problem okay

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:04,970
okay so so noone else got any

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,750
suggestions on what we can do to build

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:21,230
an open mobile platform should we all

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:22,400
work with mono or something you yep till

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,200
all depressed that we have its world

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,580
changing device sort of thing that works

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,450
for apple every time they have that

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:33,290
video and slightly lesser extent

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:37,640
Google's what to put the nexus one big

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:40,240
press yeah okay it's what get the

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:45,650
American village it is what they good at

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:48,770
okay all right um i guess if no one else

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,900
has any other comments we can draw to a

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:56,480
close a little bit early there i think

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:59,840
that's actually yeah so um so yeah I

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,810
guess basically open hardware is not

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,720
necessarily the solution but it does

00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:10,190
enable certain freedoms and an open

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,990
platform is is a good thing open

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,570
standards on the open platform is even

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,910
better and if anyone's got any

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,310
suggestions on how we can actually

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:22,250
facilitate more open mobile

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:28,370
distributions then please give me a

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:30,670
shout and tell me what we can do so

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,790
actually get a question for you I

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,780
obviously with if you're trying to

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,580
reconcile the entire linux distribution

00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,900
create one standard for all these

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,990
devices you do need to be concerned

00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,820
about different chips different display

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,710
resolutions different keyboard different

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,980
interrupts all sorts of different nests

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,260
yeah I'm what have you guys done to say

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,510
create the database for EV device

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,250
dependent and the device independent

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,690
layer so that you have a CEO of building

00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,570
a standard interface through all these

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,450
different devices right sort of yeah so

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,310
um that's a that's a good point actually

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,230
because

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,970
the whole device dependence or working

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,070
on multiple different types of hardware

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,690
has been kind of solved in the desktop

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:17,060
world by having you know built for

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,440
different platforms and so on I guess

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,420
the challenge in the mobile world is

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,640
that you have to build on a desktop and

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,720
then cross compile for the for the

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,830
hardware that you're you're aiming for

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm here I believe that's the difference

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,300
between intel based computers an arm

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,250
right and as a whole yeah different so

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,380
to a certain extent we're kind of lucky

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,410
in that that's partly been solved by the

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,630
Linux kernel so with the limo platform

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,000
sits above the colonel but below the UI

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:49,520
layer so we're with purely middleware at

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,500
this point so it's you know it's then up

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,870
to each of the manufacturers that take

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,810
the platform to just compile for you

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,820
know whatever their target devices so

00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:02,330
the limo platform itself doesn't

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:04,880
actually solve that that issue will

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,920
address that issue so you basically take

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,690
limo and you give it to Samsung to NEC

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,420
the motorola and they implement it on

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,160
their devices yeah ok so you replace the

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,130
subtle over they've poorly developed

00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,920
yeah with a star one and then if they if

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,540
they do anything that specific to their

00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,980
device the expectation is that they

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,230
would then contribute that back so that

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,240
others using similar chipsets for

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,420
example could could benefit from that ok

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,490
doesn't actually happen and it's early

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:36,800
days yet so yeah yeah so theoretically

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,910
the palm pre could be supported by limo

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,110
um yeah palm could you know I'm could

00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,030
come along to us and say we'd like to

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:51,120
use your operating system and we'd be

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:55,080
happy to help them looking right ok

00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:00,650
right if there's um no other questions I

00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,650
