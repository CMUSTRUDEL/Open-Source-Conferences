this isn't talk about your brain and I

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,400
don't know if you have already heard

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,040
about it or maybe already use it would

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,470
be most interesting to me if I knew a

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,189
little bit about your reason for coming

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,269
here so anyone here from minutes of

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,840
solutions or other software projects who

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:32,030
okay see lots of hands so I some real

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:38,370
listeners you know just appear fighting

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:43,320
quite place for work okay I'm trying to

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,820
give a real overview tour not get to get

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,969
to get too deep into the technical

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,420
things of course the technical things

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,210
will be interesting to you to help you

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,600
but at first I'll try I want to try to

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:02,760
give and get an overview and yeah get

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,400
that subject start for you because if I

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,200
guess but if i really started all the

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,380
technical stuff then i can go for hours

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,740
and the problem my problem is that I'm

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,970
the principal development of this stuff

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,369
and so I'm always deeply buried the

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,229
technical details and it's very hard for

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,869
me to look at it from a higher level so

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,570
actually um yesterday as well if you're

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,729
also friend and tried and a friend who

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,110
doesn't know anything about it and try

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:41,670
to use his help to get it onto better

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,590
level that doesn't divulge boo and only

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,299
talks about technical details and

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,960
features and

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:56,289
so having said that basically going to

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,020
talk about what is the rain what can it

00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:07,929
do and why would you want to use it and

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:10,080
I'll given a small example so little

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,849
bear is a download movie director and

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,180
handles extra key requests that come

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,970
from web browsers download programs so

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,530
basically users sitting on the computer

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:26,230
we want to download piece of software

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,790
disk image or something and if this is a

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,700
popular thing that they want to download

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,420
then there's always the problem that it

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,790
and work of service is smaller Lots

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,239
enough and so you have to spread out the

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,900
load or two maybe in the whole world and

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,739
different cells so you need some kind of

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,630
framework or software to keep that in

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,780
order to maintain that and to keep it

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,109
rolling your eyes and framework

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,750
different cases that ever you do that

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:02,230
one key system actually director which

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,359
the middle and gets these requests from

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,209
users who bounces that away by actually

00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:11,489
redirects to other machines to mirroring

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:15,100
service so let's mirror the content and

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,670
then there's monitoring tools and it's

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,040
tools for exploring a content on each

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:27,489
mirroring server so you know what hold

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,620
on I'm probably more but I try to not to

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,930
get too technical but sir having said

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,810
that a few to ask at any time interrupt

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:40,599
me because this songs not for me being

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,480
feeling well here boxes for you to other

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,190
questions or to learn something

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,250
interesting with what might help you so

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:55,600
nervous a nuisance

00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:00,280
three years and it has proved to be very

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,710
solid secure and secure it's written

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,420
program with security in life from the

00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:10,690
start it's very modular so we should

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,810
take part of it and deploy them on their

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,090
own or you could sell will take a good

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,510
for example to completely replace the

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:23,050
database that is so behind it and we had

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,600
a scene with another 11 and adapt that

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:31,060
to the one part the bottom of the

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,350
weakness and for example what I one

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:39,360
example a quiet corner is that

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:42,960
sourceforge uses algorithm or an

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:48,970
infrastructure database I feel that

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:51,910
handles the Roku the association of

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,990
Medusa uses IP addresses with certain

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,729
networks and autonomous systems and puts

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,940
that in relation to the mirror service

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:05,590
network relationship network location

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,240
and finds new girls by that one head so

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,320
this is one part of your brain which is

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,970
not sure but can also be used on its own

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,440
and source for shooting that part they

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,740
look in the mirror brain because they

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:22,950
already had huge infrastructure do it

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,870
over the years but it is something the

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,680
verbal is fully open source so it's

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,080
there for anyone to use and

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,539
it's actively developed although I must

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,009
say that I would like to see more of a

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:46,559
friend because so far much of that shows

00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:50,099
on my shoulders and quite on any kind of

00:05:46,559 --> 00:06:00,229
continues like good ideas bad ideas good

00:05:50,099 --> 00:06:00,229
code back odors and just Collins so

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:13,740
getting a little bit more detailed where

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:17,639
does the monitoring it does load

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:21,389
balancing for the requested us out found

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:26,539
out to all of our servers you can tune

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,539
it and load from it there and

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,759
optimized for big loss while we rose and

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,270
sometimes mirrors are not lowering the

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,430
complete file tree that you have to

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,990
offer them maybe just lower the last

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,539
wheels or maybe only AMD architecture

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,959
stuff like that and your brain is an

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:53,069
automatically because it periodically

00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:57,330
scans morose and the loomis at the

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:59,430
finest and started in the database so it

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:05,689
always knows where to send them flying

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,689
and top of that it's 20 by their

00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:13,430
priority that you can choose how much

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:18,330
faster should be how much load and just

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:24,550
like that I quite a few livers not not

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:26,900
everything is hard-coded so that's

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:36,050
that's one of the one of the flexible

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:38,990
parts for finding the best neural server

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,300
for client your brain uses geolocation

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:49,790
and also global routing data which is

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:54,230
basically digital for routing tables G

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:57,080
vocational puts a fly into a country it

00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:00,500
tells terzian ok this time is coming

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,980
from France emerging from from the

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,770
United States but there you can often do

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:10,990
a final next on certain networks for

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,850
example in Germany there's a huge

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,130
network between all the universities and

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,700
they are all in the same autonomous

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,490
system so it probably makes sense to

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,190
keep a class people right inside those

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,360
network and so that's what Morgan does

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,810
because on can you find out in from

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,740
which network the client is asking now

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:41,270
that even more narrow case with the

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,789
University Brussels you will be has lots

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:47,930
of clients who voted out of office and

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,720
if they run out of office or clearer and

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,800
more break can see that it's actually

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,840
the same network prefix where the client

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,540
miroslava allocated and so all these

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:05,090
requests could go to this mirror and not

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:07,430
to the next one of course this is this

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,500
is a time range we're a selection that

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,050
only makes sense if you actually have

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,600
lots of girls because otherwise the

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,300
chance that you have a fine

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,490
saying that because quite low for fibers

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,490
we were done yeah

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,160
I mean the granularity

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,970
that's automatically in the way that the

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,610
squirrel is automatically chosen as the

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,880
best mirror for this client on the other

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,830
hand it doesn't that doesn't mean that

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,380
the mirror is only for clients from the

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:03,560
network but you can with a switch and

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,290
switches into network only vote and then

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,780
we'll get only those big mess and no

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,900
other requests or you can have another

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,520
similar switch i can say with neural we

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,580
can only request from the same what

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,580
another system or next level only from

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,510
this counselor or only from this

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,000
continent and so that's a good way to

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,340
move to limit the load that certain

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,860
birth yet for example narrow and even

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,900
easier you don't want to send request

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,050
from anywhere else to them just from

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:42,580
their country so it's very important to

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:45,940
encapsulate that thanks for the question

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:49,130
so next thing to mention would be that

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,960
over these mirror selection which is

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,960
kind of complicated process in itself

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,680
now the interesting feature is that

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:02,810
Merle brain can generate metal links for

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:08,120
double clients or it can

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:10,520
integrate it appear torrent data so but

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,580
it can get fired where can take over and

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,130
try different lures a dog apparel and

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,070
your nose by the cryptographic hashes in

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,640
the me telling how to verify really

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:25,880
right Conda correct quantities writing

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,010
so that's very powerful hopefully used

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,140
in the future meetings are being

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,250
standardized right now and I hope that

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:38,740
in a few weeks that will be in our

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:43,540
official RC for the former that it's

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:48,290
written an article so I said watch

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:51,440
football yes me telling also supports

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,839
would good Republicans and so you could

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,970
have ftp murals actually thinner walls

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,310
or other also hit yes and that's that's

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,950
also where the torrents come in because

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,410
it can cook a torrent link and actually

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,500
it will be cool someone suggested to

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,650
fill a spell that your brain might be

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,710
able to just automatically create

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:19,250
torrent files because we're O'Brien

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,900
already has infrastructure to create

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,240
hashes put together caches of all the

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:27,680
flyers and down with some kind of

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,570
tree or database so easy to at the same

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,700
time to just create important files

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:41,870
because nowadays is using the usually

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:48,320
manual process so it would be great make

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:51,950
sure I'm not not too sure about

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,290
negligence so I have a saying itself is

00:12:51,950 --> 00:13:01,050
based explicitly on the happy farm yes

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:05,850
this is basically ash yelling at JetBlue

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:09,570
you have fun Dax on yeah yeah i'm not

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,399
sure if magnet links are have the full

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,300
power because if it's only one hash is

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,070
only profession to complete thing and

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:25,529
the piecewise hashes that you have a

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:27,209
torrent files or emitter links and where

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,510
doesn't find it some kind of database

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:34,529
working on a project yet okay but that's

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,019
that's requires that someone gives out

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:42,050
the fires and greatly increase the

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,050
hashes so you don't have control then

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:53,310
yeah that's you yeah but for for large

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,700
files there's a reason to one tell

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,019
because something goes wrong that won't

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,540
have one hash than I have to agree

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,779
translate the entire fire and if you

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,450
have p / replace hashes you can I group

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,010
asleep quickly and correct just kept

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,270
missing the missing of the wrong parts

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:15,899
again but anyway magnet links including

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:19,589
mega planes so into the metal links it's

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,720
just possible and I would also like to

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,450
do that because it sounds like another

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,970
another another way to another good way

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:33,540
to get the tiles get some some more

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:36,959
download programs to use it one thing to

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,540
not to forget is that your brain works

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,380
in the background meaning that the user

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:46,070
doesn't actually notice anything but

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:50,160
that also means that you has no direct

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:53,329
way to influence the behavior or to

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,970
decide something to override the

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:58,970
selection decision so basically

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:50,230
otherwise yes and no that's I that was

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,790
that was implemented in our brain at the

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:58,000
beginning because when we wrote it or

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,900
when I wrote it that we had that in mind

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,230
we try to to minimize confusion between

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,210
different levels on Neuros by making

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,230
plans stick to one year old ones once

00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:13,450
one Laura was chosen or further requests

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:16,420
were sent to the same euro if possibly

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:21,250
all because maybe i was missing then

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:25,660
would still rather walk but after doing

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:30,180
that for many a year i found that it

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:34,420
does not yield any advantage anymore and

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,550
in fact sometimes when i rose are broken

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,010
it could mean that you are sent to the

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,400
broken girl again again they don't get a

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:46,890
new chance to just get another next time

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:49,250
so the advantage of a bit of variation

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,500
bigger than

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,370
the perceived advantage about sticking

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,830
to 10 it's still possible to compile in

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,010
this comparison you need an additional

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,290
library here and memcache demon it's

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:08,630
still possible to do it that way with

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:10,939
more grain and but actually nowadays I

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,150
think about about the bottom the

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,770
contrary I would like to add another or

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,949
two to bring this feature back but in

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,569
its reverse form so it always takes

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,110
another neuro so if you do the same

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,819
request twice once more once more it

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,420
usually means that you have a problem

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:31,640
and if your wedge business another girl

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,430
different girl for fall for the user the

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,800
next time give really good thing so

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,050
maybe you can bring this feature back in

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,750
both these forms because I think

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,840
depending on the content the state of

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:49,250
the murals both the waste could have put

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,500
the advantages it would be an

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,410
interesting feature because we have

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,080
terrorists it same constant flux so down

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,270
maybe try faster person for every place

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,670
at one o'clock then ten father replaced

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,890
in our laser and so on so then there's a

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,120
database file tracking these you get a

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,120
database of baroda

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:47,040
because you just because we much going

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:51,180
on sighs yes you know exactly what you

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:55,470
mean yeah yeah metallics can be a

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:58,470
solution for that actually lose and our

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,320
users metal is also for that purpose the

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,750
reason we use with sequin yes with a lip

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,540
sub and literally instance since happy

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,610
you know everything start of a metal

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,940
links that also means that on the

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,550
development tree which is constant books

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:18,030
where are the clients just have enough

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,770
enough long mirrorless to try and they

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,780
will find somewhere else and they have

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:26,670
the hashes to verify that is actually in

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,980
the file but there there are some

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,170
strategies that we may control model it

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:35,940
later returned because it's long subject

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:38,220
to deal with that for example locks

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,290
delivering every fight over mirrors but

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,600
also give you a certain files from the

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:47,370
whole service and and more about this

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,570
it's getting focused but it's definitely

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,100
something I could

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,230
so I would like to discuss the little

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,059
fella that is that's the principal

00:19:52,230 --> 00:20:13,759
problem of keeping a list or state

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:13,759
because it was

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:56,380
yes I had one side a crazy idea to

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,490
actually implement several brain or two

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:04,570
really implemented in DNS protocol

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:08,800
instead of HTTP and actually be quite

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:15,480
feasible explore little bit but problem

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:18,340
is that it wouldn't be usable in so many

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,490
settings so it would be very usable for

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,910
linux estimate the special Lynyrd start

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,920
applying and the puss in boots what's

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,510
safe to climb fights and round trips and

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,510
stuff when you could use a key addresses

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,400
instead of host names and stuff but I

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,700
think it wouldn't be you be worthwhile

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,980
to go that route because then it it's

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,280
not interesting for the larger community

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,430
of content providers and neuro operators

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,380
then it's only only for you and you

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,410
probably won't find anyone else who can

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,620
check who can share with you this

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:56,890
special setup on the other hand you can

00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:01,320
of mine my parents proposition would be

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:05,170
to combine geo DNS Admiral brain by

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,090
first having booked by having a

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:11,110
Melbourne serve on each continent for

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:14,490
example and then using gdns just to find

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:18,100
the we're all brain solo from the client

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:20,860
because then the client goes to from

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,920
here to the United States only one time

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:27,930
for DNS lookup gets back to nervous

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,870
w-whatever and then everything goes to

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,870
they are so HTTP keeps actually people

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:35,820
be kept on continental in the country

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,220
whatever and then at the same time would

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,160
be a good way to have a failover set up

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,640
and so if the Bourbon server needs to be

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:49,410
maintained or it so it dies for some

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:52,020
reasons then you can just flip the lid

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,630
dls so change the s configuration you

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,670
have a lo TT le long time Cleveland 10

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,970
minutes then you can just flip over and

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,740
then all the traffic goes to another

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:24,270
remember bed wearable cellar which is

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:27,120
far away but still yeah but you could do

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,700
it in s request from that directly with

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,280
osseo to the neuronal but could only use

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,900
IP addresses some no neighbors virtual

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,440
hosting and done is getting difficult

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,440
already

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:18,490
yes actually yes I thought I went this

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:21,940
way and I thought hey I need to submit

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:25,000
this data somehow appliance or client

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,370
has a way to decide I was alone and

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,520
maybe to provide feedback and then I

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,290
found that this this former that I

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,150
designed for transmitting information

00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,450
was exactly what commits early guys

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:40,059
already had done so I realize oh I had

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,110
the same idea or day the same idea it

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:47,799
was it existed already so I I struck the

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:50,919
my Texas face forward and then just use

00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:54,309
my colleague since then and really tries

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:57,760
to do all that but there's no feedback

00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,410
part involved but there could be that

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
would be very interesting especially for

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:04,150
us distributor who has all the

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,910
infrastructure to collect data to gather

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,330
data like that from basically win

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:13,030
millions of for clients you can do some

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,450
interesting network studies and

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:19,690
quickly get feedback when network stops

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:24,240
working there and it would be high

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,240
interesting and just simple things like

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,830
on the other end very difficult it could

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,480
look very different from different

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:09,760
clients views so there are always other

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,650
bottlenecks in between the client and

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,460
the mirror so it's kind of hard to

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:18,730
actually apply reports the smell doesn't

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,640
work well it's quite hard to say if if

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:30,180
we give to the mirror or if it doesn't

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:30,180
work well follow people you know

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,800
Philip even without

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:55,920
it just requires hundreds of

00:26:50,010 --> 00:27:00,780
yes it would be quite hard to do it very

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,520
simple and very robust to actually

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,570
prevent something like that I think so

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,840
it gets its Harry so maybe it's a good

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,730
plan to follow but it still still good

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,580
idea to think about it have in mind

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:20,550
maybe some things can be done okay we

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:24,630
don't have too much time left maybe 10

00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:27,720
minutes so very interesting discussion

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,870
much much more interesting than the most

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:36,330
engineering things I would have told you

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:39,840
very thankful for that so this one short

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:43,640
slide that shows the in eight or nine

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,350
projects that use a rubber end up by now

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,740
three software foundation's my secret

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:54,840
pride especially since I didn't know

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:58,430
about it all and somehow they got it

00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,960
running without my head meeting and

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:08,310
understanding but not a really clever

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:11,460
probably so openoffice org is searching

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:15,780
right now his longtime process boxes

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:21,180
would be finally finished soon and I

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:23,550
wanted to do for case study box the

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:28,320
switch Optimus of awk from the previous

00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:31,590
solution to the solution girl brain the

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,520
previous solution was not very good it

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:39,240
choose a random arose from over the

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,090
whole world and it also didn't scare the

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,070
reward when I consider the biggest

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,809
problems that it was not really

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:52,210
develop interested to fix it otherwise

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,490
it wouldn't have necessarily been a bad

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,409
solution but it was kind of abandoned

00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,649
and that the scoober stay in a cabin for

00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:01,720
software framework like that because

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:07,570
nobody's working on that then it's going

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:10,509
to bit rot and so if if I leave Susan

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,820
and I have left to the last fall then

00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:15,220
what would happen if that could only be

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:20,799
a meeting in our in-house development

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:30,809
and I let Suzy guess I right now I'm

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:33,669
looking for the tape offers after yeah

00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:37,029
from from the start of the project I try

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:41,740
to do something rather that can be

00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:46,200
shared in other people so open flexible

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:50,220
not tied to some super thing so

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:54,580
hopefully that works out even more

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:57,190
there's one thing I wanted to

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,399
demonstrate because of his little

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:05,409
strange interesting point about mirror

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:09,970
selection three ways of doing it this

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:14,529
was the first mode that song was using

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,509
so far it was a random the user here

00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:19,269
wouldn't be this is the tip of the stock

00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:22,610
tip of Africa the user which was the

00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,670
water leak or sent to Thunder OH

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:29,240
headed to myself as well that I doubt

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:33,950
from Brazil few targets so that's

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:39,280
obviously not very comparable many

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:42,170
solutions just use VoIP to select the

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,130
negative closest neuro order on the same

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:48,980
country or the same region and in this

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,890
case that would lead to more in South

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,440
Africa or more in Kenya to be selected

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,390
for user Mozambique are the problem is

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,510
that international interconnectivity

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,330
between these countries is very bad but

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:07,250
they all have satellite links to Europe

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:12,020
and to the States so what needs to be

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:15,230
done is that you actually need to send

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,809
the user to America Germany and this is

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,130
something which is automatic Rob Ryan as

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:25,160
a different configuration you can

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:32,419
basically tweak arbitrarily that certain

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:35,330
country is to be used as well for client

00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:38,350
in totally different country that tries

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,860
to reflect or to enable you to reflect

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:45,559
these national links and one thing I

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,059
also also note is that this is very hard

00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,940
to acquire this kind of knowledge

00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:51,980
because we only learn it through user

00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,220
reports as you stumble over by accident

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,470
I once read this quote actually someone

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,720
who posted that on the open office

00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,470
mailing list so this is great example

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,799
performance user in Mozambique who has

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:22,330
who needs three weeks to download

00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:24,700
20 megabytes of openoffice.org fire and

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,860
he tried and then there was the starting

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,929
to forget it he actually ended up asking

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:35,309
about that on the donuts it's a

00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:37,690
beautiful name you then able to like to

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:41,769
resume at all although they have to do

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:45,129
it so they don't we tried but probably

00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:47,799
him and then you know the password rope

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:50,769
or not so I over to try again pursuing

00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:56,379
can be difficult but the whole nother

00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:59,409
question how so basically in five

00:32:56,379 --> 00:33:05,499
minutes we have to make room for the

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:09,840
next part and i think i have said most

00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:15,759
of the things and some quotes that a

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:21,190
good motivation to keep going with your

00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:23,679
brain and yes so more information can be

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:28,450
found on the website of course melbourne

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,519
at all will find many lists and feature

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,409
list and stuff and make the madness

00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:38,059
would be very good place to get in

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:53,610
contact also there's an IRC channel

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:57,029
we're hanging around yeah they're on the

00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,740
next page you will find two kind of

00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:01,019
values there's more brain development

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,419
mailing list and then there is a generic

00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,720
minister Scott discuss the urban a talk

00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:10,710
it's a mural so it's a madness not just

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,859
in your brain but that I an idiot

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,829
instead of that as a place for

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:18,829
discussing general Moreau issues like

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:24,690
discussing strategies for redirecting

00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:27,030
traffic or something mirrors also placed

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:31,079
former happens because there is simply

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:33,149
no other forum in the world where mirror

00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,980
unmans and content providers talk to

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:38,629
each other there are only the project

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,609
specific mailing list of offers fedora

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:44,280
debian they all have me remains but so

00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:45,839
there's no interconnection and there's

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,990
no place to discuss like noon ET

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,260
strategies we have discussed here so

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,780
there's Magnus that you find there for

00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,560
that purpose with the spoon nothing to

00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,750
remember going but then there was all

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,270
the normal normal brain you know user

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:09,700
list everything is concerned little

00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:12,520
brain that's code for ya

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,750
you talk about how mere brain it's the

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,940
user whoever wants to find it should

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,320
have been weird is there anything about

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:27,430
the actual mirroring inside you mean an

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:32,320
information or human oh I their own

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:34,510
software are for example do i set up all

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,640
the mirror myself or is it geared

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,950
towards model where I just provide the

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,990
software and mirrors around the world

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:46,660
things and they just register themselves

00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:49,630
it would both work you can set up where

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,900
of yourself I know several setups where

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:56,230
people have done that just feel like

00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,339
company or just disagree structure three

00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:02,260
in hosmer or infinite countries and on

00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,089
the other hand you can if you have a

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,390
popular project that is mirror anyway

00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:11,099
from bureaus over the world and you can

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:15,670
enter the data into the database is when

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:19,060
you watch you with what you need to

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,160
centralize the government so there's

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,130
there's no infrastructure for minerals

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,579
and deluded themselves in the recognized

00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:29,859
that's something something that should

00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:34,180
happen with future possible by various

00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:37,030
things I have a have some demo that I

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,119
can maybe show to which is the people

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:43,839
later because now running out of time

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:50,380
but on the other hand yeah I hope that

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:52,500
we can maybe talk more about its next

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,500
door

00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:59,440
so there are no cute questions then I

00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,440
