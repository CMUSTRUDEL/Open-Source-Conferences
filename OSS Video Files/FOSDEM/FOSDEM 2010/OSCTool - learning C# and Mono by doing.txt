Title: OSCTool - learning C# and Mono by doing
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Jo Shields

In 2007, the Oxford Supercomputing Centre received enough funding to put some infrastructure in place behind their clusters - but found a lack of adequate tools to manage it. This talk covers the progression from Perl-based prototyping to 25kloc of C#, due for GPL release in Q1 2010. 

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

so working right okay the title is a bit

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,940
misleading but I'll get to that in a

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,269
second those who don't know me I'm Joe

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,070
shields I'm a debian developer I kind of

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,980
do the same thing ish in ubuntu every

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,710
now and again and for the purposes of

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,369
this talk the relevant bit is that I

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,519
work for the University of Oxford as a

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:32,250
Systems Manager on the high-performance

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,340
computing center so we have researchers

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,739
who need to do big calculations whether

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,170
it's simulating protein folding or

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,510
testing out cryptography algorithms or

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,309
whatever they need to run stuff they've

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,510
got a desktop we've got hundreds of

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:51,480
servers they come to us so what is this

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,420
talk actually about it's partly about

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,609
something that we did at the Uni but

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,890
it's more about why and that why is

00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,899
explained with this statement here which

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,590
you'll see a lot on the internets which

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,210
is we don't need mano you hear this a

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,000
lot you see it a lot you see people

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,229
saying that mono is unnecessary that

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,830
there are loads of other things you

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,990
should be using instead the mono is just

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,020
a copy of Java so use Java this that and

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,750
the other now with in hpc especially in

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,850
the UK we have a technical term for this

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,619
kind of thing which we hear from from

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,990
from people for like vendors we hear

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,810
this kind of very certain statements and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,159
the technical term we have in the UK is

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,560
this it's bollocks it's not based in

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,250
reality it's just based in silliness so

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,649
the talk is basically explaining why we

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,920
ended up using mono in production in our

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,630
Center for doing some stuff and if that

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,040
sounds really boring him as well go get

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:02,820
a beer or something so why did we end up

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,110
in this situation UK universities as

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,680
with most universities around the world

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,810
on Harvard are massively underfunded and

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,330
in 2004 the UK government through a

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,260
group called the higher education

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,849
funding council for England I think

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,180
invested over a period of three years a

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:26,420
billion pounds which is not much these

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,989
days with a pound away is and out of

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,670
that 1 billion the Oxford supercomputing

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:36,200
Center got a 3 million investment in

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,959
basically in buying hardware in buying

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,560
actual computers where as in previous

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,690
years what we had to do was save up all

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,730
the money we could blow it all on one

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,200
computer and hope that would last us

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,910
until we found more money down the back

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,290
of the sofa out of that unfortunately

00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:00,200
due to cronyism politicking and assorted

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,269
other issues we had to spend more than

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,640
half our budget on building a very

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,090
simple air-cooled machine room in an

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,549
empty room and somehow are 500,000

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,940
estimate from IBM turned into 1.7

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,829
million from the university estates

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,670
Department but but there you go we had

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:22,790
1.3 million to buy shiny toys and what

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,700
we plan to do with that was to buy three

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,269
different computers that serve different

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,150
purposes and different researcher needs

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,739
and some stuff to glue that together

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,670
just things like shared disk areas

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,459
networking infrastructure and all of

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,150
that so we'd never have met much money

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:47,569
before money is nice but it brings

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,519
problems so the first problem is

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,400
traditionally what we had had we'd only

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,350
ever had two systems at a time and it

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,690
was a lot easier to just treat them as

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,940
two completely disconnected systems and

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,530
say that's computer one back to user

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,690
name and password on there that's

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,489
computer to user name and password on

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,769
there when we create the accounts

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,180
they're the same but you know passwords

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,180
you forget to update it on one of them

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:15,709
and this that and the other and we were

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,650
using the new son I think miss to to

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,940
handle sort of inside a cluster keeping

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,799
that password updated on that one

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,220
cluster

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,659
so we thought well that doesn't sound

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,909
too good and when we've got three

00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:31,159
systems for systems five systems that's

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:33,169
just going to piss everyone off so we

00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:35,000
had to centralize all our authentication

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,310
stuff so you have one username and

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,319
password getting on to all our kit no

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,879
matter how and you are shiny and only

00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,470
have to change your password once and

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,599
worry about managing your account once

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,419
and we thought this is just not going to

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:49,610
cope it's going to fall over dead

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,440
because it sucks and there's an S Plus

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,740
which nobody cares about because it

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,690
sucks and there's ldap which kind of

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,129
sucks as well but it at least can handle

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,830
all of these extra bits we wanted to do

00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:05,870
so ldap is great but not everything

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,870
behaves the way you want it to the way

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,729
you expect it to with with ldap so we

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,250
run into a problem in our testing for

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:17,930
example that we could store passwords in

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,940
the LDAP directory but the the Pam

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,400
module that handles password changing on

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,319
account login wouldn't update any of the

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,659
shadow fields so your password would

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,400
still be expired even though they try to

00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,409
change it and we keep running into

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,949
issues like this with the standard tools

00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:36,020
that think they're smart but they are so

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:39,620
we we had to catch a grand plan this

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,960
plan took about 18 months before we even

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,490
got into hardware testing the plan was

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,620
do something about it find something

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,840
that can do ldap management in a decent

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:56,210
way or if need be write something and as

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,610
a systems manager that I know that

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,430
there's only one answer to any problem

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,979
that needs a quick fix and a bodge and

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,550
that answer is pearl because you can

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,599
never go wrong with pearl except if

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,099
you're trying to do something big and

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,870
complicated and scary and anyone who's

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:14,719
ever looked at the RT kodel will agree

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,840
with that it's not always the answer

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:19,250
because pearl very often I'm not saying

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,979
it's always the case I'm not saying its

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,050
fate to be the case but often pearl is a

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,909
right only language you'll write some

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,539
pearl and then the next guy will try and

00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:32,509
look at your code and go but it's very

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,009
very easy because Pearl has lots and

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,569
lots of shortcuts and tricks and hacks

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,759
to write something

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,099
and maintainable and if you try writing

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,110
big verbose easy code that can also

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:45,939
become big and bloated and maintainable

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,499
so I wrote a version in Perl and I

00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:52,099
needed a few weeks for recovery

00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,719
afterwards and thought this this isn't

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,520
working so we're going to have to

00:06:53,719 --> 00:07:00,439
tighten down what we need to do and so

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,689
we redid our plan we had to write

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,520
something I'd had time to look at all

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,990
the other things I could find for

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,360
managing accounts in the way that we

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,789
wanted to do them and there was nothing

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,459
already out there that or there was

00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:16,039
nothing out there that was close enough

00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,080
to what we wanted to be worth editing

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,169
either so we had to do something pretty

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,749
much from scratch we wanted to make it

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:26,240
so that anyone using a proper OS could

00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:27,830
have a nice clicky GUI to do all their

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
account management tasks and that's not

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,629
just changing a password but it's things

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
like checking on how many credits

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,369
they've used on our systems and dealing

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,050
with their email account details and all

00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,759
this debt on the other and for people on

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,289
legacy operating systems without a next

00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,219
server they could still get some

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,689
functionality through putty so we wanted

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:50,419
to make sure that the gooey stuff was

00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:53,839
layered on top of an engine of some kind

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,209
and we wanted to make it so that the app

00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,979
could be extended over the years as new

00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,319
needs arose as we found things got

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:05,899
annoying in a console we could just add

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:08,689
stuff as and when and one thing that for

00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,789
us was an important requirement is the

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,860
stuff that users need to do like change

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,689
a password and there's stuff that sis

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,149
admins need to do like change a user's

00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:19,069
password and it's silly to have two

00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:22,490
different tools to do the use of stuff

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:25,579
and the admin stuff so we wanted the

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,360
same tool using the same back-end to

00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,110
handle both and simply to to deal with

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,699
permissions and it's out and the other

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,449
to make sure that users don't go

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,099
creating accounts only sis admins can

00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:39,740
there's so much overlap it didn't make

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:43,630
any sense not to have the same tool for

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:48,139
both so what do we need to worry about

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,490
first issue develop a team me in my

00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,529
spare time we're not doing

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,310
the sysadmin stuff which is not a huge

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:58,730
team for 1.3 million quids worth of kits

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:04,670
worth of administration stuff I think

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:08,200
that makes sense so small team we kind

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,510
of knew what we were buying to a degree

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,420
with two-thirds of our planned system so

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,880
we we knew at the time that AMD

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,620
processors were great at memory

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,750
bandwidth and we had a lot of codes that

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,200
were memory bound so we would very very

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,970
very likely be buying amd64 for one

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,360
cluster we knew that for floating-point

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,860
performance it was hard to beat Xeon so

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,410
we would very likely be buying a xeon

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,110
cluster and we knew that we had a third

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,420
set of users who rather than having code

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,180
that runs on a cluster their apps only

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,730
work on one computer with lots of cause

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,860
and lots of RAM so we had to buy a

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,690
computer with lots of cause and lots of

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,600
RAM or a set of large computers with

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,070
lots of cause and lots of ram and that

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,870
was really up in the air we didn't know

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,000
what to expect and we couldn't legally

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,680
insist on one thing or another because

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,200
then it comes to public money and public

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,670
tendering and favoring one company over

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,459
another and all of these problems so we

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,290
had to write our tender in a way that

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:10,510
said just give us something with lots of

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:13,610
cause in one box give or take and

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,170
similarly for the operating system you

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,120
can kind of get surround it by saying

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,910
that will take any OS as long as it can

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,190
run linux binaries but we have had

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,750
people give us for example opensolaris

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:28,579
or solaris proper version bids saying it

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,110
will run your linux binary 100%

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,720
perfectly but we can't legally say that

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,600
we can't do it so we had to think well

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,120
we might have windows on the cluster we

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,380
might have mac on a cluster we might get

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,899
big HP integrity system running hp-ux on

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:53,089
titanium we might get IBM coming to us

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,980
with a p-series running AIX on power we

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,810
really didn't know what to expect so

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,790
that was one thing again but we had to

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,940
worry about is if I users log into our

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,139
system and that system is weird they

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,720
still need to see the same

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,299
tool presented to them that they would

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,249
see on the cluster they could see on on

00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,410
even on their own desktop we need to

00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,269
make it so it's the same ol of them so

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,999
we have to think about that requirement

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,410
and for example there are development

00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:21,199
tools out there that aren't particularly

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,579
favored on on all architectures there

00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:27,290
are clothes tools out there that are

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:29,600
very x86 or AMD six before so we have to

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,819
worry about it we didn't make it to too

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,949
tight a requirement just in case but it

00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:36,559
was something we try to think about when

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:39,230
I say we I mean me and the final

00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,269
requirement is if everything goes

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,049
horribly wrong and the very simple nice

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:47,869
concept of doing everything in a nice

00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:51,589
cross platform I didn't work it had to

00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:53,269
be easy to fall back on see libraries

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,850
and there are billions of C libraries

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,679
out there for Linux which is the OS

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,350
really mattered to us that could do

00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,919
pretty much anything and just in case we

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:08,360
had to be able to use them so first

00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,639
requirement Malik band I have got better

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,889
things to do with my time like dealing

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,290
with users than worrying about memory

00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:18,860
allocation so nothing that needed me to

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,489
worry about managing memory was even

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,980
considered as a framework to deal with

00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:30,319
2nd district nothing if possible on only

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:33,279
the main architectures third issue yo

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:37,040
source fine binary fine cross-platform

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:43,459
really like it but if need be fine we'll

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:46,129
do without it and the last issue I i did

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:48,199
a degree on java so I learnt one or two

00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:52,039
things about Java in the process and how

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,259
do you see from it or not so i did a

00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,759
search for proper development

00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,980
environments that make my life easier in

00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,480
attitude which has got 20 odd thousand

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,089
packages in general so i was bound to

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,799
find something and I had a look at the

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:11,539
list I read up a bit on those ideas and

00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:16,499
the languages that they were centered

00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:19,109
around and I tried a few little pro

00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:21,299
tests in those ideas to see well that

00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:24,779
seems quite nice I like the syntax it

00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:28,079
it's intuitive it makes sense IDs

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,819
user-friendly and there was a short

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,069
listing process which kind of didn't

00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:34,109
have that many choices on it of all the

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:35,939
things available and this is late to

00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:39,059
know I think early two thousand seven

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:41,999
sorry monodevelop was the only one of

00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:46,169
the ones that I tried that seemed like a

00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:50,489
serious thing for me to use given all

00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:51,869
the previous constraints so how did I

00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:54,059
end up with this how does it take those

00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:57,239
previous boxes that i mentioned number

00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:59,759
one I don't care about memory that's

00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:02,909
what mono does for me so I don't like

00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,999
having to care about things a cpr kit

00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,679
arches there's like some really fringe

00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:10,609
stuff that mono doesn't like but other

00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:16,459
than that all the CPUs work fine with it

00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:19,709
OS is fine on on windows on mac on linux

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:22,049
maybe got it working on k freebsd i

00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,720
think regular freebsd works but the big

00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:27,269
commercial unix is not so hot so LAX

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,669
would have been screwed and hp-ux would

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,859
have been screwed but as I said it

00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:34,439
wasn't the hardest of requirements and

00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:36,479
we can't preferred Linux anyway so we

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:38,009
would have found a way to fiddle are our

00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:44,159
tendering process to ignore the not

00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:48,629
things anyway if we had to use with mono

00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:52,319
with C sharp using C doable and with

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:55,019
Java fridge it's not or certainly in

00:14:52,319 --> 00:15:00,299
2000 with the Java vendors available

00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:02,339
then wasn't yes as i mentioned i learned

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:06,209
in three years doing a degree at

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,099
southampton very very C centric the the

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:12,629
concepts and stuff would in there was a

00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:14,159
bit not I'm off asleep today so

00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:16,979
everything was done for all the high

00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:20,489
level stuff was teaching of algorithms

00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:25,619
other I think Malik implementation in

00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:30,530
John weird so I know enough other to be

00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:33,420
a bit and sharp was close I've

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:37,140
to jump into it and go find of know my

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:45,390
way around and I can ignore the Java the

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:48,630
really stupid what did as it ended up we

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:54,240
didn't know what we would a graphics

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:57,560
Alex 700 with surprise on it came with

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,820
mono the mono question in an issue the

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:07,080
processor and us any so ever um which is

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:10,770
good we ended up with system with 250

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:16,980
what terrible manager I'm admin tool

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:22,520
it's all the other system one doing is

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:27,030
at the moment is the G op and ya wanna

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,750
do it and some of the appeared time so I

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:35,640
stopped after this big thing with

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:40,110
thousands and like us oh and appeared in

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:45,900
going on and certain people I took them

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:51,770
so things up here using masks II got the

00:16:45,900 --> 00:17:01,590
plugs in there someone dead the future

00:16:51,770 --> 00:17:04,340
sir mano that and give off and the

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:08,250
moment but I haven't been with our

00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:16,140
system for everything top of the ball

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:20,670
ldap like so we all have our a nail appt

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:28,100
sir rang on Debbie through s cryptid old

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:28,100
and it work nuff oh it in fear

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,169
if you want one

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,940
I

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,890
the exporting is the end let's slow

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,890
today

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:22,680
right here we go okay so that's the gtk

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,250
java version that's running on my

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,660
desktop in the office back in Oxford as

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,360
you can see there's this big list and

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,460
we'll that God functions each of those

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,470
functions here's a different assembly

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,350
that advertises itself as the main

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,280
concepted all it says I need these

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:48,240
security requirements here is my mic on

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:53,720
so I click on also expiry and then it

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,500
waits according to an action

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,810
so your lightest and is grayed out of a

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:06,700
box here there's a grayed out selecting

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:06,700
meantime here user

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,169
let's let Jenny beach

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:26,059
and his past I would expire April

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,059
twinkle so okay and wait some more

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:40,240
I now have a pin access we've got kind

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,890
of sue do like being built into the the

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,300
user model that we've got in our LDAP

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:49,230
directory so every user can have a super

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,180
user signed to them so I can have a

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,880
regular user can gain privileges of an

00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,430
account leader an account leaders only

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,790
users passwords or whatever and that's

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,040
all built into the design of the ldap

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:07,980
steam up as well as tool so now i'm an

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,980
admin assuming that gives an updated

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,230
might be working might not have Delia so

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:25,250
now I've got there hey box I've got

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:25,250
select search that one Jamie eventually

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,799
and reset password expiring select box

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,010
yeah so get an extra day expiring

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,090
done

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:07,410
and back to me on that sir so Ward Emily

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,970
see there's one use reason to use curses

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,970
is it's a bit

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,050
any curses written in C sharp and Paul

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,050
same functionality

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:49,279
expiry patrol else should refresh

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:50,900
control L Rai doesn't but if you can see

00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,770
the fear in the goons very similar

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,770
sodium just one

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:10,760
so use the same tour same UI style and

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:12,110
it's the same back end of the functions

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,460
in my left I see there's a smaller less

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,280
should I haven't put that occurs is

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,420
gooey lot of them like more widgets and

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:24,110
I'm lazy but it's the same stuff pretty

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:30,950
much so that's that's the life that I've

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:54,290
done breathing it right so why am I here

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:55,940
talking about this now yes okay so as an

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,040
employee of Oxford University and I'm

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,470
sure many of you who work for pretty

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,410
much anyone why not sign in point P

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,960
agreement says that anything i do on

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,750
their time is owned by their full

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,670
stopped in the story the idea being able

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,660
to sell it to everyone to try and cover

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,070
some of their horrible deficits so

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,410
everything is copyright another boxford

all rights reserved and a few extra for

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:26,480
luck however there is a process it's

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,300
relatively new it's relatively

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,540
unpleasant and it's based in their

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,540
current process for mustard seed pack

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,309
needs so I do things like fill out eight

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,590
page forms with my

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:42,830
I begin to intellectual property due

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:46,090
diligence questionnaire I think that

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,470
I've had to do a lot of this stuff and

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:52,730
process started and that's true and I

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:54,620
finish these slides months ago so I have

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,700
made a request to the appropriate people

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,889
and that's currently in the hands of the

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,149
head of research I think was the last

00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,129
thing I heard was that it's with

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:07,370
research people who depended on by the

00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:10,879
university's company sales people to

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,529
them it's going to happen I make sure

00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:14,720
it's going to happen for there are

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,700
delays on every stage and I started to

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,610
worry about in my day job so I part

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,049
spent all my time trying to chase up

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,480
your apprentice short version so before

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:29,809
I get to Q&A soon it happens given how

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,399
like everything's running couple points

00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,730
that I'm expecting to hear what's the

00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:39,049
hand store why aren't we using QT is

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:42,669
beauty developed a short version is back

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:47,179
in two thousand seven cutie was either

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:50,960
commercial or GPL and much as I wanted

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:53,509
to make the tool we've got free software

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,389
I couldn't guarantee i get permission

00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:58,369
for that from the University and the

00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:01,759
license the commercial license for Cutie

00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:03,950
pretty strictly said you cannot use the

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,110
GPL version as a demo you have to buy

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:09,460
the commercial version and then use that

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:12,559
your tool if it's not great from day one

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,210
so all that was my understanding are

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
there any way I could be wrong on that

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,509
but that was my time reading of

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,369
licensing

00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:21,129
I didn't have to worry too much about

00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,539
about this stuff so I kind of avoided it

00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:25,659
for licensing rings Eames and that's

00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:27,729
fine now but it's a triple license for

00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:30,549
lgpl but I don't have to rewrite

00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:33,579
everything from scratch so I'm going to

00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:36,849
keep their with 80k I've stuffed with it

00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:40,179
and I'm really too lazy to change now so

00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:43,570
that's why not cutie next one hate them

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,769
okay i know that if there any tracking

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,879
people in the wrong i'm going to hear

00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:51,099
about this truck professionally we've

00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:53,169
had lots of problems with hyphen every

00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:55,419
time a user comes to us and says hi

00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:57,849
you've got this fighting thing we kind

00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,919
of high input they don't try following

00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:03,999
up from your email we've had problems

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,649
with the library's not fading rights and

00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,989
some architectures we've got problems

00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:12,759
meeting certain versions which change

00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:14,619
the way the other is done so hi thought

00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,809
I was kind of relatively disposed

00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:21,849
against it we took on the short version

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:25,239
I had to play around like and

00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:28,809
subsequently and I kind of fiddled

00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:30,579
someone's since what's on the done back

00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,039
in the early days of the wiimote packing

00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:36,249
so to make the playstation 3 remote act

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:40,809
as a as a keyboard we could eat at the

00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:43,209
mythtv and i found it i didn't really

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,289
like the syntax and i can understand why

00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:47,319
people wouldn't like the way that it

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:50,949
works but i found the syntax unpleasant

00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,449
for the way I approach coding and given

00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:54,250
the problems we've had with plants and

00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:56,260
stuff at work I was

00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,230
too happy with using it so that's why

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,620
not so no one needs to ask questions

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,340
about those two items because now

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,340
questioning

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:20,240
high drama most of the time was just

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,100
cold a discipline and again lazy people

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,040
doing stupid stuff is going to

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:33,470
yes just makes it very easy

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:35,420
yes very good at that if you have coding

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,020
standards pretend you can bite really

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,470
awesome pro but yes I think that's

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,440
entirely fair some languages make it

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,770
easier to be stupid than others on so to

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,970
repeat things for camera thing and

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,550
you're right that you can run very nice

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,350
pearl it is technically possible but

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:59,900
rumors on the internet to like very nice

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:02,480
PHP because some languages I know it's

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,000
mark fetch some languages and just by

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,370
design imports a little more structure

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,740
than others and to an extent I like

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,150
having a tablet structure enforced well

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,650
I'm trying to do something serious and

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,020
attacking something together in five

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,780
minutes then I'll go straight two thirds

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,540
it is great for that but what's I have

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,880
to start being disciplined it's good for

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,920
me as someone who's not too bright to

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,980
have the language kick my ass when I'm

00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,480
not being disadvantaged on sauce one

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,480
cooking courses yes

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,070
yeah well I'll tell you one of the other

00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,140
issues that would have arisen if I had

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,750
gone with Java is where business or we

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,730
ended up a titanium system and for a

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,040
very very long time we were having to

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,280
turn away users who wanted to run big

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:55,550
memory java stuff but needed a Java

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,640
newer than one for two because the

00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:02,750
newest jar available titanium was driver

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,570
142 until about six months ago and there

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:08,300
was a sudden update from Suzy to give

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,600
the the job of the runner honking de el

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,090
web which was 15 and it kind of exploded

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,080
randomly with the user codes so we

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,810
pretended it didn't exist so we had

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,340
problems similar very similar problems

00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,300
with version and distribution that we

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:29,120
faced with our users will conquer so

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,500
even if the if the JI thing has never

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,780
been needed if it was never a

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,030
requirement others they in stone I would

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,470
never need to do see than job would have

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,270
been a much stronger contender than it

00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:43,220
was as it was the existence of Jane I

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:46,180
don't think J&A has quite made it into a

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,700
stable release of anything yet that's it

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,840
jla supposed to be a fixed J&I which

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,840
looks a lot like clean vote

00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,810
well it's a legal issue because if that

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,950
thing ever makes it into Java then it

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,120
means that Microsoft was actually right

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,470
when they made those changes to the

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,900
language that they got two billion

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,570
dollars for so it's not like it's going

00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,460
to happen I'm not going to comment on

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,350
whether Microsoft had ever been drawn to

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,600
have anything because then I'll get my

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:27,430
ass kicked but even if he's going to eat

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,980
you so that that was why you why not job

00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,140
basically I agree entirely some

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,760
languages and you can walk in support

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,680
though I've seen very nice readable

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,280
pearl but I'm not good enough to watch

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,280
it okay anywhere else

00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,760
