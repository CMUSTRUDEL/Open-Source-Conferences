In 2007, the Oxford Supercomputing Centre received enough funding to put some infrastructure in place behind their clusters - but found a lack of adequate tools to manage it. This talk covers the progression from Perl-based prototyping to 25kloc of C#, due for GPL release in Q1 2010. 

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
