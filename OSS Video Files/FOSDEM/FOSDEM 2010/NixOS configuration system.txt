so for this user needs less

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,780
configuration system so just to clarify

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,120
how many person of you have install

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:20,640
needs first okay so I will oh I don't

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,880
know you so well first describes in its

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,210
packages and all that said versa i guess

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,210
nobody knows about it improves in here

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:36,710
so there is first language which is all

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,780
mix which is a functional language and

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,719
which is pure so we don't have side

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,800
effects it's the poor phrase and the big

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,129
step well knit packages which is a

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,129
collection of packages like a PMD pkgs

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,010
and we are necklace which is the

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:01,859
distribution based on distances and this

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,390
collection of packages and the main idea

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:09,540
which makes is to put at the same rank

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,490
segmentation fault or access to bind

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,390
memory package that you don't have

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,820
allocated and no such file or directory

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,820
because if you have a reference to find

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,009
your file system and you haven't

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,530
installed it you have a no such file or

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,549
directory and we put set as the same

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,070
rank to avoid confusing with the pine

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,400
leaves a packager we have the directory

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,650
which is an export and in this territory

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,420
we isolate every package so we don't

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,560
have the sludge bin and stuff like that

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:52,320
and we compute ash two for each package

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,850
in function of the sources so libraries

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,729
the compilers builds create an old Santa

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,719
terms that are used to build the package

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:07,530
so if you change one of these you may

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,520
usual get a different action so you

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,520
cannot multiple install off openssh

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:21,190
because you have came to

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:24,520
street or c compiler no we openssh we

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,940
have a nice tie which is almost this one

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,340
where we have been functioning this we

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,250
have a standard environment and the

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,310
function which is all make derivation to

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,770
phrase of the package in the nixle webs

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,170
name of the package where the sources

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,030
and the motor function to fetch the

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:47,500
sources from an your you are out and

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,450
mexican lunch about it just and our

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,890
environment and it's a function is used

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:59,200
to include default compiler z and

00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:01,720
compress chemical tools and you make so

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,760
this is the expression used to build

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,860
openssh almost to use this expression we

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,680
are the name dates five which is all

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,700
packages and we have also our index

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,300
force special purpose third packages for

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:24,490
example and in this thing that's fine we

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:28,209
say that openssl is this one and selling

00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:34,060
is this one and we use a nice language

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:38,770
to create this derivation and when we

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:42,670
evaluate openssh we evaluate the

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:47,370
relation we can instantiate it by very

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,370
conveniently a passenger next door

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,840
so now we have a bit of knowledge about

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:04,950
Nick we see that everything is isolated

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:11,280
and why not choose such thing for other

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:14,700
stuff we called use this for generating

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,910
configuration files if we suppose that

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,970
the configuration file can we then give

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,910
all its inputs we can generate the

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:28,950
configuration file for all packages so

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:32,910
we have done that and we afford the

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,940
system star jersey in liturgy we are for

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,790
Z in the street and wolves are stuffed

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,640
with which come with your distribution

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:47,990
and as long as you can express it in

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:50,340
need there is no problem so we've made a

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,000
distribution which is owning sauce and

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,620
this is version you can be all static

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,090
bar static means that we don't support

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:07,710
databases and every fine which is new

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:13,770
table in substance that we cannot

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:17,790
produce it when we go to the system so

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,460
as every package for every configuration

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,750
file is elated internet so we don't have

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,180
slightly more slash USR ever eggs are

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,890
non-destructive because when you install

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,040
something you install it in the store

00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,290
and in the store you have different set

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,060
of packages you can want multiple

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:42,000
openssh version in parallel so if you

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,990
change the configuration you can install

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,660
a new version and when you install the

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,360
version you just change the link to some

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,460
versions that you want to use so we can

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,700
roll by the basis using two previous

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,289
version and as we just have to change a

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:07,490
link upgrades are atomic

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:11,389
our Anthony is the funds that we need

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:15,349
salsa stateless helpers to reproduce it

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:18,860
because we are all inputs that we saw

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:22,339
before and we have a specific age which

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:29,029
is determined by its inputs so we can

00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:30,979
reproduce the same configuration and we

00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:36,110
just have to cook this a configuration

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:38,539
to reproduce something so here is a

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,959
small example with two terms and emails

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:46,219
and uses I think life and we only have

00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:50,959
Sh because this link it's Colonel Rick

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:54,139
Barnes it but flasher is empty and /

00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,199
baby same no it's not empty it does not

00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:02,439
exist and slaw should leave that this /

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:06,169
like this method is to but we have more

00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:09,229
funny stuff so not on my computer

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:12,490
because my computer is too old but you

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:17,059
have a complete at least getting stuff

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:25,099
for years so just use a eagle as a

00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:28,909
desktop you have big slice oh so to show

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:32,990
LG configuration file now generated we

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:36,259
have ssh comfy which is just a file

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,860
which is for in the next oh so we have a

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,629
function which creates a derivation we

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,729
need the name of the configuration file

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:50,409
and website web statement which design

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:54,949
the intention of the user configuration

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:58,360
where we choose to enable its eleven

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,360
forward or not

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,020
it cell needs is a lazy language and if

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,900
we don't evaluate everything if we don't

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,080
evaluate this configuration file we want

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,600
about ready and we won't sterilize this

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,940
information we want to evaluate each

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:29,760
folder it's odd so we won't install it

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:32,880
because it is not required and there is

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:38,010
one special thing is that when you

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,370
enable it's on for ones then your sh SSH

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,420
complete will depend on this program so

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,820
it depends on this edge with this with

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,930
this package it depends on this package

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,020
so by installing the configuration you

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:59,400
increasingly installed its dependence it

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,290
so you you when you insulted the

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,200
configuration you insult all programs

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:08,760
that are required to run your

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,310
configuration so you don't have to first

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:19,580
install the program and then find out

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:23,100
how to configure it and so generated by

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,820
what we see as we hit at this age 12 and

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:31,430
we have over four days and hands forward

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,430
it's 11 and the path to the program

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,630
so we'll go further in the configuration

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,970
and in this sauce we have a main

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,490
configuration which is both which

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:51,050
installation ET c in its all sample and

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:54,380
called configuration techniques which is

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,300
the funds that person activities and

00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:01,940
functionally we don't have graphical

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,650
interface it's a teammate or VI and you

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,740
put all the configurations that

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,110
germinate for your system like we're a

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,590
resistible folder should be installed

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:16,010
and once the physis mus you want just

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:22,490
one device that you want to use devices

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:26,810
and in this case we set the acct

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:31,100
configuration so here we have an

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:35,120
attribute set with options that are

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,550
defined so as a user you just a tease

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,220
this configuration file are the new

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:45,200
trend which are described in a manual or

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:47,150
email in main page and you just have to

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,270
run one comment to gather your wall

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,980
system you just run this command and you

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,680
say that you want to build the system

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,570
from both the system or you can switch

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:03,890
which will replace your tour and

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:05,870
sustained by the new one and when you

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:09,230
have installed this new system we have

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:14,170
to activate it because the same link is

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:19,090
not enough to make your configuration

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:23,300
use able we have to change back stable

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:27,170
wud we have to change some fun which are

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:32,180
required to be in / it easy and to be

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:36,020
simulants for security reason and as we

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,680
saw we innovate the needs system for

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:44,030
road bikes so as you saw in my group

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,170
menu I have a lot of versions for coming

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,170
back to previous configuration

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,980
so I wouldn't go I will continue in this

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,080
configuration and I will display with

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,300
incessant acts in the sink types you can

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,660
say that you depends on water font that

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,210
you want to embed their content so here

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,140
i have created a configuration for this

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:15,070
room and my configuration requires that

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,340
i need this room so i want to enable

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:23,650
each server yeah that's work and i want

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:25,720
to use a small footprint window manager

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:31,540
because it's very it's a very old

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:34,030
computer so the system x is that we have

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,630
imported files and optional definitions

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,490
this thing tax is used for / gtc

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,870
configuration that needs but you can use

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,050
a little syntax which works as well

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:51,370
where you define imports and option

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:56,880
declaration and option definitions we

00:12:51,370 --> 00:13:01,840
will go on option decorations so I

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,760
create the new new module which is an

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,040
attribute set where our defense options

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,120
and I defined that I want to let an

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,660
Egyptian to this firm if I attend or not

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,650
as a person so the default value for us

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:22,980
is true i will find the time which is a

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:27,149
nice function will use the cursor

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:32,220
and I give a useful description which is

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:35,730
not the case here as pipes are defined

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,449
in X we cannot look both types and we

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,750
can use next language to define new ones

00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:46,110
so we are boolean strings and we can

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,660
define out on the environment variable

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,800
and how to merge them merge multiple

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,930
definition of the attention so if one

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,930
person defines that he wants a path to

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,870
be sent to something and I'm sorry

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,490
module defines something the same fact

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,040
to be said to something else we can

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:09,300
decide ultra virgin with a little common

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:18,209
between say we can use the relation or

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:23,579
list of another time now we'll see how

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:28,079
to use this options so here we are in

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:31,649
this agent for option definitions and we

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:38,209
define the sshd enable in function of

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:38,209
the configuration so the this argument

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,750
represent the wool computer

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:49,010
configuration in this argument work

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:53,579
everything about your computer see we

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:56,819
add this feature the from the laziness

00:14:53,579 --> 00:15:00,540
of the language this argument is emerge

00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:04,529
of all of modules and which reproduce

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,360
the same types of modules so this is the

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,120
options that we have defined in another

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,500
module and we use its value from the

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,380
world computer configuration in this

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:24,740
case we want we want to say that we want

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:28,880
to disable ssage p.m. at the Fulton and

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,850
when I say this arguments merge all

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,509
modules

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:39,430
versions of this one so this module is

00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:45,100
included in the wall configuration so

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:52,209
this introduced tricky things which goes

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:56,139
the next control flow to break so if we

00:15:52,209 --> 00:16:00,160
want to check the value of abscess that

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:02,550
obvious option if we add an answer them

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,839
then we want to disable sshd

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:10,300
weather-wise we take positive values the

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,560
problem here is that when we want to

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,170
evaluate that you at an answer for 10

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,449
you have to evaluate this is the

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,149
argument and when you leave obvious

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:24,490
argument you urge all modules so you

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:28,660
have to feel what housing option

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:32,980
defining all modules and then you can

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,810
define CSS to it so no all options

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:40,060
define you have to evaluate all

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:43,120
configured in each module so if you want

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,880
to evaluate this one we actually like

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,740
this if this if statement and we have

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:53,709
one in fine I to and there is a rosary

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,829
kernel which is that enabled by as a

00:16:53,709 --> 00:17:01,829
verb function which takes by default by

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:05,709
default and true value we fall with all

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:08,709
so if someone else's if a another model

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:14,620
defines that you want to enjoy safety we

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:17,650
can force it with only defining force so

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:23,350
we need to introduce control flows for

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:26,049
modules and to use that I've introduced

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,449
properties properties are you type

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,820
definitions so here you have a

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:33,299
definition and I want to say this

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,750
definition is only valid if i added

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:39,700
function which

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:42,370
property which will allocate this is the

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,000
enable definition with the conditions

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:50,500
that I want to I want to define this

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,580
value only if I attend the folsom and I

00:17:50,500 --> 00:18:02,230
want to overwrite also value with us to

00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:04,500
10 priority so we we annotate each

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,260
definition and when we evaluate

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,320
configuration we just take properties

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,440
and we move then we do they do the same

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,510
until we can really say to them so we

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:22,630
can really execute them when we are in t

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:24,520
equal ear when we're sure that sir there

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,110
is no or a church and unless the user

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:33,040
made it so meaty like the if statement

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,980
on the service and when we go further on

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:41,010
ssage and when we go again further on

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:44,860
the enable definition to express this

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:48,100
properties we have four basis function

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,010
which are on delay which define out to

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,980
heighten the property when we delay it

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,760
we have on global delayed which is the

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:02,920
same thing but with not with knowing

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,800
what other properties we have only high

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,060
which is used when we evaluate the value

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:14,080
and we are on local about which is used

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:19,000
when we value into value but we signal

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:23,200
range of other properties and this

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,920
allows us to define many properties so

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,990
this property is used and cannot be used

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,260
to define that we don't have the

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,600
definition which is not the same as an

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,850
intelligent an empty definition for

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,010
example force is not the same as not

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,600
defining force we are the if statement

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,140
as

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,270
as presented here we have override which

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,669
a low us to decide which definition

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:58,799
takes precedence or not and we are

00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:03,419
ordering to order multiple definitions

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:09,900
as definition can be spread around not

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:13,169
all modules you know i will show you

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:17,039
some real examples so here is a simple

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:20,630
example where we unload time zone since

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:25,020
only this module we define an option

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:27,570
with default value as far as angles are

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,740
not mature and very castle maybe we

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:35,460
should change the default value and we

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:40,080
defined the configuration and out what

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:45,780
we show up using initial to a shell

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:49,200
script initializer so we were to add

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,169
that we export the time zone which is

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,450
defined here this option and we want to

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:58,140
say where to find the times on

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:03,840
information so only by adding this

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:08,220
module your shell initialisation will

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,620
depend on the agency so when you use

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,030
this module this will install the ship

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,030
see on your computer

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:25,200
no we answer a smaller window manager so

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:31,050
I truncated some parts because

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:34,930
unfortunately the qualities a bit short

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:40,360
and this is the same it's episode we are

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:44,020
some shortcuts here we have we define as

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:51,120
it's a tribute CMG to a shortcut to user

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:54,100
it's llamada options and we may only

00:21:51,120 --> 00:22:00,090
meaningful to configuration how to start

00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:05,050
the insulin window window manager and

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:08,020
just by defining the enable flag of its

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:14,020
vinod this will install the insulin

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,910
window manager so at this time we at

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,140
this time of the presentation we can

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:22,870
reproduce most of the systems that you

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:28,420
are used to with vivian on hoser

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:35,380
distribution but we can do more than

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:38,920
that what we can do is express things

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,400
with more abstraction what you see here

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:46,510
is generate configuration for this

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,660
laptop so if someone else which is

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:54,940
unlikely as the same type of laptop as

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:57,010
me i already searched him with defining

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,130
a default value which is just for

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,980
special kids over and over right which

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,550
returned out which supports the SETI so

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,930
it won't have a problem with the battery

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:12,820
I've already said worked hard the

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,240
modules which are required to boot

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,940
system it is locked up I've already set

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,460
the Cable model so you don't have to

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,900
find out what tichel defined for

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,879
deception and the same for the touchpad

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,769
and the same for

00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:36,249
is a video card also the same for the

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:38,409
pcmcia with config option which is quite

00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:42,789
different than what you can fall into

00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:47,019
web so this wall is version show you is

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:52,059
that you can go where you can have a

00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:54,669
very very useful abstraction compared to

00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:58,239
just installing packages and configuring

00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,459
apache configuring its word i saw stuff

00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:03,639
like that you can say that you want to

00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:08,619
have a configuration for your own

00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:11,039
network or for your cluster of computers

00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:13,419
with small differences between them

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,929
please give use the abstractions that

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:19,469
you want you just have to private module

00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,819
which is a really simple syntax and

00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:24,249
define what are the options that you

00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:27,129
want to define and if you need it you

00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:37,919
can take the options that are use by

00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:40,659
user modules so weakness we have we have

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,059
packaging management which are with

00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:47,319
isolation so we don't depends on water

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:50,649
program we have atomic upgrades so we in

00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:53,589
return for need sauce we have world

00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:57,339
bites that we're in every tube we have

00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:59,499
milk tea users which have been presented

00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:02,409
in this presentation which allow you to

00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:05,319
build your system as a normal user so

00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:10,109
you can do as a normal users Mitzvah as

00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:13,690
we go beyond you can also build in a vm

00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:17,979
to test your configuration in a vm and

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:24,899
as a super user which can just set it to

00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:29,169
boot or to switch it and we can

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:32,889
reproduce it because if you just state

00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:35,190
the configuration file you send your

00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:38,100
configuration file to somebody else and

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:42,890
well I go to reproduce

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:45,690
same as you because we only use

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,720
regenerate the configuration file and we

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:56,610
use this package manager which has

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:59,100
exquisite the balances so there is the

00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:05,190
link to exploit support if you want to

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:32,450
visit or you must visit it and if you

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:35,400
have questions see I is that you know

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:40,020
from the sources from the growth spurt

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:44,190
and from audio stuff is that you can

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:46,020
predict what I super left so there

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,000
actually is computed from the forces and

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,059
you don't have to build it to determine

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,549
this as the ash that usual that also

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,549
notice before to feel exactly

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,299
and these were questions

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:15,970
I phones I mean so much people in one

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,970
presentation

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:32,400
okay so let's continue need a small view

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:47,350
sorrys on the AC which is a cynic to the

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:52,200
neat store and dances working as is 80

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,200
oh let some comment

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:10,240
you believe it's wish me

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,240
oh yeah

00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:29,390
still working yes we are you have / UTC

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:34,430
and watch links which are the basis and

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:40,390
slightly in four sh and in / gtc we are

00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:40,390
whole lot of ceilings picture shows the

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:49,090
contents of the root directory should

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:54,620
contain my own configuration objective

00:28:49,090 --> 00:29:04,090
yes good territory yes you have products

00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:07,580
you have root m NT and right fresh and

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,210
other stuff which comes from my previous

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,210
systems

00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:26,629
and the sources of mix recharge for this

00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:32,079
so let's see so you use em season / EP

00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:35,509
seeds most of the same names which are

00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,570
this whole day this is our starting

00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:42,739
point for examples something that are

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:48,009
enabled by dat nation straight and

00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:48,009
suspected every jettisoning do sometimes

00:29:49,929 --> 00:30:02,029
in / ET seen its way it sounds we are so

00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:04,249
good we have configuration duck takes we

00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:08,570
have an old version should be nice and

00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:11,599
we have some sources were also on Mar

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:15,320
configure my computer configuration its

00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:21,619
resources and pocket the list of

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:23,869
packages if we go into the sources we

00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:26,419
show that the money or directory and

00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:30,489
this is an old version because i know

00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,489
very busy this computer

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:41,800
so we separate all modules inside the

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,800
list of directories

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:52,630
and we have a lot of modules so we have

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:55,690
modules for return stage 14 is the eight

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,350
server for its morale for my wind

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:04,630
forcing window managers at i'm using and

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:07,710
not for this video projector so we have

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:11,560
a lot of modules for this play manager

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:15,760
when the claim this file manager and can

00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:18,730
you carry p.m. so we have a lot of

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,180
modules on to our all works to generate

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,980
the wall computer configuration and

00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:30,670
inside each module but you have access

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:40,870
to the wall computer configuration no

00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:45,940
questions there are some projects about

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:49,920
price calculation to check that really

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:53,290
is a system is with respect to license

00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:57,280
currently it's only a project now and i

00:31:53,290 --> 00:32:00,460
bein faults and some jobs to manually

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,190
check that you have the right licensing

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,950
you're doing your derivation by checking

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:14,590
all I pages from which it depends so

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:21,270
there are some words like that za losers

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:25,050
I think research director distributed

00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,050
specifications of networks of

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:47,690
so they can reproduce le fedora yeah

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:53,550
with our ports also do other platforms

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:57,200
cross Blandin foundation yes it yet at

00:32:53,550 --> 00:33:03,030
least we have a 4th to the Shiva block

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:05,430
for this for the arm platform and xos

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:10,830
manages you good and all those things

00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:16,310
and we have so though all those

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:20,880
properties also in the sheer black and

00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:25,560
mixed packages also has some kind of

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,900
cross compilation to build this building

00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,280
exhaust system only for these packages

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,280
for another

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,680
let's take the case is whether in fact

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:55,560
we can break into an xls assistance and

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:59,310
modify about some install application

00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:04,230
bar some kind of built-in safeguard for

00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:07,560
detecting corruption of phones yes first

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:15,679
there is one thing which is that many

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:15,679
but all patents unix or are read-only so

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,610
this whole day time

00:34:34,100 --> 00:35:23,360
so so yes which one please external

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:56,560
yes see you you have a list of profile

00:35:52,750 --> 00:36:01,440
which is in which is incremented each

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:08,020
time you install a new package

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:11,040
generations yeah you want a narration so

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:15,250
the last one is my current generation

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:19,150
the two previous generation are what is

00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:22,300
the car coming from modification for

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:26,290
tabloid either install or and then sold

00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:28,770
something so you have generation I don't

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:34,530
have to make sure i may I can be related

00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:51,310
and you can go back to Freddie's profile

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:55,740
yes when you oh yes you can check it

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,740
with the repository

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:21,820
last 50 for this mobilize its name of

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:24,280
this pie as you can see I just include

00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:28,650
so computer January configuration so you

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:44,920
just have to do the same to use a

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:50,460
configuration for since we're using the

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:53,740
purely fictional message tremezzo matter

00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:58,080
Oh mates with you have beautiful poem so

00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,080
when I recycle transfer particular

00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:03,599
depeche mode we get

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,730
when we want to transfer particular for

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:17,320
both know its dependencies from justice

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:20,400
again depends are adapted that just

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,400
