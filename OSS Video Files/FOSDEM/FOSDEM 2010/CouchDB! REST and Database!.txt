CouchDB how does a document-oriented DB work or how does it work for you?

This presentation takes a look at CouchDB, a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. CouchDB design and replication features solve the problem of high-traffic websites, distributed peer-to-peer, and offline application, all in the same time.

The talk will cover the different CouchDB usages and integration in applications and its deployment. It will also present how to build and distribute standalone CouchDB applications on top of CouchDB using its REST API. CouchDB applications can run on users desktop an be replicated using a P2P system. Data could also be available offline.
