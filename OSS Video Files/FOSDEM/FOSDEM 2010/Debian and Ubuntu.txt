so everybody I'm you can use bone and I

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,560
will talk about the gentleman too so

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,269
before we start who in the room is a

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,910
debian developer or maintainer of

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:21,270
packages ok and with an ubuntu developer

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:27,390
is mo to go dev recio end I have oh it's

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:29,310
not much good ok so first I thought I

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,170
would start by explaining why i think

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm qualified to give this talk just so

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,680
you don't run away thinking I'm going to

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,210
12 for 45 minutes so I've been at the

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,980
gin developer in the boot to develop a

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,770
since 2006 and I've been involved in

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,620
Boston for involves distribution for a

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,610
bit more time than that I've been

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,820
involved in improving collaboration

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,860
between both project for since about

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,780
that time actually I've developed many

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,510
things many tools that help

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,899
collaborating collaboration between

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,820
those two distributions int @ indeed

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,159
both debconf and going to developer

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,280
summit so I have an idea of of both

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,350
project work from the inside and I

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,150
friends in both communities I would like

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,700
to keep so I know this talk is recorded

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:23,790
so everything I say is well carefully

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,920
said so i will first talk about the moon

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,680
to development process and oh it relates

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,490
to the w on development process let's

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,720
make everybody on the same level then i

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,939
will discuss the current state of

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,880
affairs between debian ubuntu and then

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,259
we'll try to discuss the future and what

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,009
we could do to improve the situation

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,890
further so first we win to determine

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,890
process and general linux distributions

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,890
so what's dulu distributions do say

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,229
still software from upstream project

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,259
they put it so nicely together there's a

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,500
lot of work going on this area and then

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,530
they take all the fame and the flames

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,140
for what they did usually so yeah really

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,929
the important part is this one that's

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,840
what linux distributions really bring to

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:16,590
use a standardization quality assurance

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,349
but so when two that's the same except

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,379
it has one special upstream that is

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:25,800
debian that also supreme and at the end

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,470
but does one one of them is debian so

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,610
that's how it works basically serve as

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,980
the user the Ubuntu user gets packages

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,500
from ubuntu and boot to text software

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,519
directly from the upstream projects and

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,209
also from debian but it's a bit more

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,489
complex than that because ubuntu often

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,370
can't just take the packages from debian

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,950
and need to change them for good reasons

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,989
for example for example the tool chains

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:59,299
that the compiler libraries might be

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:02,459
different then sometimes fixed bugs that

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,879
only occur in ubuntu or subtle clean

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,980
boss distributions you need to integrate

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,980
the various packages with launchpad for

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,530
example and sometimes then what i want

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,340
to provide new abilities for specific

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,620
packages to values us and it's often not

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,160
possible to do that work in debian first

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,470
so we're good reasons for 12 to proceed

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,420
like that and to modify packages that i

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,639
imported from the den so it's a real

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,299
workflow looks more like like this so

00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,040
where's upstream projects debian and

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,250
packages so software from debian gets

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,290
either in put it directly into ubuntu or

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,799
get touched before it's integrated into

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,889
ubuntu so the interesting question is

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:55,200
what has a percentage for this this and

00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:57,690
this of course so if you so this i'm not

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,319
giving the detailed process but those

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,599
are the results that you can trust so

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,150
about three quarters of the ubuntu

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,150
packages coming directly and modified

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,690
from debian verse fifteen percent a time

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:18,750
of Debian packages that are modified by

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:20,250
Ubuntu seven percent that are only said

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,450
that directly package from absolute

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,450
upstream projects by Ubuntu

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,440
and if you sum that up you missed four

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,340
per cents the newer upstream releases in

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,910
ubuntu and for Zeus is difficult to tell

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,090
whether it's just an update of the

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,910
Debian version or a fully new package

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:48,060
based on speed and by cash directly from

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:50,560
the epson project so if you look at

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,110
packages which have newer up to

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,300
melissa's in the main section of ubuntu

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,120
so probably suiting the back can't read

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,460
it so that's fine if you look at the

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,520
name you see lots of Katie Steph norm

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,650
stuff so that's really the thing that

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,100
matters for 124 which they want to

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,539
provide the newer village if you look at

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,789
universe it's a bit more interesting

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:16,570
because you get lots of London packages

00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:19,240
so it's really apparently motifs that

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,789
take the bed package and updated to the

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,500
latest upstream version sometimes with

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,990
that well often without collaborating

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,160
with debian solar is in the in that list

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:34,570
for example as ml donkey i think it was

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:41,860
oh it was there in the past I can see it

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:45,520
no sorry yeah it's a it's between ubuntu

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:49,479
karmic why its stats on the Ubuntu comic

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,560
and well it's generated by some

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:55,210
diversion in window kamik in a bit more

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,610
logic but basically you take the version

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,610
of the packaging gammak I look at

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,710
whether it's it's a same version it's a

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,169
well it's the same version as a package

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:10,930
in debian or its effects with ubuntu

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:21,639
something known open to well i won't say

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:24,190
okay naanum so if the package is okay if

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,630
if they folks at it is a change that

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:34,140
package say number it Google like that

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:37,409
so if a specific dash not 0 ubuntu one

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,399
it's a version is modified by

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:49,580
window so newer option release means

00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:53,839
something like that that blue bin too ah

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,839
that's in Europe seem reasonable to you

00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:06,300
is easy and but that was so that was in

00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:07,889
kamik and compared to the version of

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,579
debian package when this they stopped

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,529
sinking from debian obviously and i know

00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,159
if you compare it to squeeze two squeeze

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:20,879
the debian testing most of the packages

00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:23,039
in hammock i know are no older versions

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,769
compared to squeeze so squeeze as newer

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,139
releases and kamik which is relatively

00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:31,110
normal since chemicals released three

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,589
months ago and sewers are probably

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,509
packages which are which have for some

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,059
reason have not been updated in deadline

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:43,579
for quite a long time which might be

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:46,849
interesting to investigate actually and

00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:49,619
so from the ubuntu point of view

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:53,249
managing the divergence between debian

00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:56,909
and ubuntu is really difficult it

00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:59,519
requires a lot of manpower and because

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,559
after each really for each will new

00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,379
window release you need to update all

00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:06,929
the packages and merge the ubuntu

00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,599
specific change into the new version of

00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:11,789
the package in debian so that is strong

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,219
incentive to push changes upstream so to

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,800
the am so buzzed the goal is really to

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:20,069
minimize the belt I between debian

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,259
ubuntu invest three shanell three

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:25,739
different channels used to push changing

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:28,860
changes back to debian first a boon to

00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:33,180
developers file bug reports to go to

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,309
forward changes upstream as directing

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,809
the interactions within some teams like

00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:43,409
Simeon Vivian games team the Debian not

00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:46,079
a debian VoIP team apparently but while

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:49,500
there are some teams that with virgin KD

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,000
team I think that's that quite well so

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,890
with both want

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,580
person Debian developers in the same in

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,100
same group or simply with one person

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,000
view to side in the Debian maintainer on

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,210
the other side there's also the patch to

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,070
the batch of the valves the difference

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,150
between the Debian version to version

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:16,620
available on the pts the BTS is unsure

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:18,420
no I don't have it BTS is a source

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,020
patient view that the Debian developers

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,510
used to get the global view of a package

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,870
I'll show it later indeed EPO which is

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,970
the same but maintain eccentric so so if

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,730
I have talked about workflow for

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,690
packages now let's look at Berg's and

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,720
bug reports so currently we want to use

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,930
us when they face a burg other choice

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,300
they can file it upstream by example if

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,490
it's a genome burg Falcon signum bug xia

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,070
and they might get flamed and not sure

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,590
if it's the case for none but many

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,170
upstream projects don't like users to

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,510
report bugs directly to sams I prefer

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,730
because sometimes the burg is caused by

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,190
the local changes in the distribution so

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,450
they don't want to get spammed with bugs

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,920
are bound they didn't did not introduced

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:12,410
they could file the burgundy ends and

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,180
they are very likely to get flamed and

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,770
the third solution is to file the bug in

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:26,700
launchpad and zones are very lucky to

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:30,120
get big nada so and we on the open to

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,300
side from many users so many bug reports

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,280
and probably not enough we're clearly

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,320
not enough wind to developers for burger

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,820
jing and squashing to fix all the bugs

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,670
that are reported in launchpad also for

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,440
many packages there is no there's not a

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,950
lot of expertise on the UN to side

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,240
especially for niche packages which are

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:57,360
really for a few experts in them for

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,070
Zeus package it's really you really get

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,460
well was ever reported a bug in

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,990
launchpad and

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,160
if it was not in your odds I can Oh

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,820
everybody got a reply in this begin

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,010
launch pad would you not well read the

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,700
blog which was involved in launchpad for

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:23,940
a long time okay let's so much actually

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:26,010
guess they're doing better than I so I

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,470
think that's really important well for

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,390
packages I think we do okay we get in

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,630
collaboration it's very important to

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,940
collaborate on bugs first I quite a lot

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,860
of packages in debian which are niche

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,540
packages don't receive a lot of bug

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,360
reports and the talking here about

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:48,810
packages like eggs or ice wizard but

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,240
well even if you take well lots of

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,520
packages in debian of a really low

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,950
number of users but for zoos user the

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,080
package is really important for them for

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:01,470
the favor daily work and for Zeus

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,840
package what they don't receive lot of

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,660
bugs in the end it's really easy as a

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,980
bird's exist in the billion package and

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,440
just don't get reported so the

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,530
maintainer doesn't know about them by

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,780
mail users of ubuntu debian we have no

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,370
numbers to back this but i'm pretty sure

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,940
she's through so there's a lot more

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,890
opportunities to run into bugs and

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,200
others also a slightly different

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,150
environment in ubuntu like nuit will

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,310
chain you are its server stuff like that

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,440
so we are likely to run into the same

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,810
issue in deadlines in debian later so

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,060
even if it's not a bug yet in the beyond

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:41,240
it could be a bug in a few weeks or

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,240
months and finally i think that

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,390
basically my point is I think the bell

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,430
maintainer should try to work even on

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,140
launch on launch pad boobaloo edging on

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,450
web package on launch pad because I

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,220
think that's serving burg some observing

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,050
blogs is improving free software and

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,410
that's really what matters in the end

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,300
it's not about fighting another to

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,550
another congruent distribution just

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,230
about improving the world free software

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:12,330
world if you figure if you fix bugs that

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,820
fixed by everybody so currently we had

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,170
in collaboration bugs where are some

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,930
bugs that get fired in

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,899
done by Ubuntu developers but the most

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:25,560
clip bugs that are just about up

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:29,220
swimming ubuntu specific changes those

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,380
whose bugs are fed using user tags so we

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,800
get another way to track how many of

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:39,329
them file not all boon to developers use

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,529
that use without user tags but it gives

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:45,660
a good idea and they are about 250 to

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:48,360
400 bugs reported that way baboon to

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:53,730
recycle which is not much not much but

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,980
still a reasonable number there's also

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,199
an ubuntu box on the BTS and now i can

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:05,730
show you the BTS so that's the pts i get

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:08,399
r against them I think it's problem to

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:14,160
patch but I'm not sure and you did these

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:16,500
down so we can click and so that's the

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,660
pizza pie get tracking system the pts

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,870
and there's an ubuntu box there with

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,550
version of the package currently in the

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:31,740
ubuntu development release so that's

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:33,209
lucid the link to the batch between the

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:40,140
deadly inversions between two version

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:42,120
and the number of open bugs but the data

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,120
in that box is not completely accurate

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,190
especially the number of bugs because

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,670
it's really important imported using a

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,589
fragile ack so it's basically gets a

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,199
list of all open bugs in ubuntu lands

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,510
end and then w get each of them

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,529
separately it's a bit better than that

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,540
but not match that generates 80,000 HTTP

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,640
requests per day or launchpad so if

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,390
lunch pilots for its is slow it's

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,459
Dylan's fault actually and also it

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,529
doesn't include private bugs and where

00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:17,819
lots of private bugs in ubuntu because

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:22,110
they use a port which which allows two

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,550
files bugs with back trace and those

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,449
bugs are tagged private by default

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:29,760
because they don't want the user to lose

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:32,170
to provide

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,800
private private information about the

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,510
system for example so now there are

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,790
ongoing discussions when the launchpad

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,370
team to solve that we improve to remove

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:49,150
that I can have a better way to import

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:51,910
the data but is still not done so now I

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,100
will talk a bit about the current state

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,900
of the debian ubuntu relationship so

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,310
that's based on my perception which is

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,750
quite fair i hope but don't hesitate to

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:06,160
ask what to discuss this at the end of

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:09,480
the third preferably so on did began

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,130
side first i think that historically

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,310
especially in the start of one too many

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,890
cds when not very happy about 12 as i

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,390
was the feeling of being stolen without

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:26,020
many communication from v1 to side

00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:28,870
crediting debian as there were some some

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,060
claims of ubuntu giving back to debian

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,520
which were difficult to back with

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,830
reality and which are still a bit

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,720
difficult to back with validly but we're

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,310
not so much to wait i will tell later

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,260
but not so much to to give back actually

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,360
and there's also some problems with some

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,940
canonical employees which tends to

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,490
reflect in ubuntu as a wall so some

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,410
while open to developers canonical

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,190
employees are humans and some of them

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:01,620
haven't always behaved very well so this

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:05,470
usually adds one towards the world i

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,540
think that lately on the debian side

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,470
things have improved considerably and

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,900
most ddc good points in ubuntu first

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,080
ubuntu clearly brings a lots of new

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,360
linux users and the gin derivative users

00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,630
so it's still better to have them use

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,890
ubuntu than federal for example which is

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:32,400
not the gin based we can be mapped

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,400
a dove as if they used windows on fedora

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,840
it also went also provides something

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,340
that just works with two for a friends

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,380
or family I'm sure that there are many

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,960
duties even if they won't admit it's

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,790
there that's production that install

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,850
window system for our friends or family

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:58,290
as I did you install the systems so our

00:17:51,850 --> 00:18:01,480
next DPL even the dudes up but it's

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,160
going to also brought a lot of new

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,800
developers to the Janus the people we

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,620
started developing in ubuntu and then

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,200
switched to the bland so that's for

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:15,070
example buried the fries Scott Kittleman

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,320
Luke f 11 yah Emilio put put Zulu moon

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:23,680
for an Edmonton n which is in the room

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:26,170
there so and not most of them were

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,320
really good a really talented developers

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,050
so it really reflects very well on

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,980
winter winds apps of course improving

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,480
discussions between both projects and

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,610
open to also serve the technological

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,640
playground playground for Debian so

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,650
basically we outsource breaking stuff

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,410
breaking the distribution with new staff

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,170
to a boon to by example say they tried

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,900
dash has been essa and bin sh before us

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,660
that worked in various both boot

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,610
improvements and debug packages are the

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,100
new GT cflags who have do the things

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,950
that were already done all that are

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:08,770
being done in ubuntu and that are much

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:11,860
easier to import to the be on later when

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,900
we went to side that's clearly a culture

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:18,070
that contributing to debian is the right

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,810
thing to do if I qds really clear that

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,540
that's the message at what they want to

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:26,290
send and by many didn't put developers

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,630
that contribute to debian but often does

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,210
not a lot to contribute back especially

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,630
on the packaging level because most well

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,820
many of the vaccines I do I just walk

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,100
around for example it's not uncommon to

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,570
see a package heading to build from

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,580
source and

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,919
they fix it because well because the

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,259
destitute fails and to fix it's a

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:52,000
disabled the destitute there were some

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:55,509
texts like that in ubuntu so there are

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,929
some improvements packages in ubuntu but

00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:03,789
not submerged actually to to upstream

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:09,399
back to debian also something that is

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:11,769
really difficult to to deal with for

00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:14,740
many d and developers at the chemical is

00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:17,769
a company so it contributes back when it

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,809
benefits them and if you wants them if

00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,700
you want them to contribute back when

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:25,059
you have to convince them that in the

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:30,940
end it it's even if it's a meat improved

00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:32,860
by revenue or reduce bellows so it's a

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,889
debian as the world shouldn't expect

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,039
many free gifts from canonical just

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:41,710
because they don't do free gifts say it

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,470
was often a reason well most of the time

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,320
there's a reason for them to do the do

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,980
the gift but there is a wearisome by

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,779
example two years ago they put a banner

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:59,580
to celebrate the debian 15th birthday on

00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:03,340
by websites that wasn't front page of

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:06,850
www.youtube.com for more than a week i

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,279
think they also they also have been

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,279
sponsoring DEFCON for several years no

00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:19,509
but i think that's a real underlying

00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:21,429
issue that that we have with ubuntu from

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,070
the debian point of view is the last of

00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:26,200
relevance for the beyond Rosie's to tell

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,570
to communicate to the community so

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,610
clearly in the Debian user base or at

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,889
least market share so if you don't

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:36,519
believe the user bezar decreased because

00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:38,500
probably about many more linux users and

00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:43,809
a few years ago at least the market

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:47,379
share is clearly decreased ubuntu one so

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:49,510
the battle on the desktop and laptop I'm

00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:51,909
sure that many of you as you are using

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,799
Ubuntu laptops and not so much are using

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:57,909
the been laptops

00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:04,720
our next dps doesn't use ubuntu laptop i

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:07,570
think so that's good also want to is

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:12,669
starting to make a place on the server

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:14,739
because many young seaside means I've

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,619
always used ubuntu so it's kind of

00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:21,039
logical for them to use ubuntu the

00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:24,489
server as well and that's kind of

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,879
foreign to see that more and more for

00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:34,029
new linux users linux is just one to

00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:37,690
invest not much else to use an he also

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:40,419
recent innovations other point in ubuntu

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,179
first a lot of them where the beyond has

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:46,600
been kind of failing to innovate lately

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:50,580
and as a result of all this the young

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:54,580
becomes less relevant even if we another

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:57,249
the basis for the for the for the most

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,619
major community distribution where

00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:03,249
community in it well for 12 which is

00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:06,279
also an important fact so i think that

00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:08,139
even if we don't need to have a lot of

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,749
users debian doesn't need a lot of

00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:12,460
features and we are not running after

00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:14,830
getting all the new linux users in

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,960
debian that's not the goal of most

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,419
Diddy's but we need to be relevant and

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,239
to stay relevant because Debbie intends

00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:25,389
to fight for important values either

00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:30,820
technical or political for example there

00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:33,929
was the iceweasel versus Madea thing

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,940
where the gun took the position to say

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:40,659
that Mattias conditions about the

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,340
trademark were unacceptable and it's

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:45,249
it's really important that debian is

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,619
able to make use points and still be

00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:50,679
urged by the world community and if it's

00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:53,919
just the distribution used by only by

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,989
dd's by didn't developers basically we

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,470
won't be earth and people would just

00:23:55,989 --> 00:24:01,450
look at us saying oh weather what's

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,529
debian again what are you taking that

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:07,509
stance right well

00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:09,609
the depot is a problem is collaborating

00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,139
with ubuntu is really and improving it

00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:13,509
is right thing to do for free software

00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:16,059
world domination if you want to achieve

00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:18,580
world domination for free software the

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:22,210
test has passed the past with that is to

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,980
help ubuntu basically and so the problem

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,559
is all do we make the DN relevant again

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,129
and still help ubuntu because the

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,320
fastest patent a bit o just fight ubuntu

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:35,700
so I think that we should really try to

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,230
improve collaboration with ubuntu and

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,179
which which means improving

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,109
relationships with ubuntu developers

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:47,259
most of us most of them just very

00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:49,059
similar to Debian developers actually if

00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:50,769
are even some of them even in the room

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:55,570
so you see that they're not that

00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:57,759
different as we should have more quest

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,340
distribution packaging teams often while

00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,179
they're not so many ubuntu developers

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,820
with time to spend on 13 debian but some

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:09,759
of them are trying to find people to

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,369
talk to on the debian side and often

00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,739
they get kind of rejected by the

00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,659
gentleman tennis is quite kind of

00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:19,299
difficult from for new moon to developer

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,570
to come to the double maintainer and say

00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:27,009
I i I'd like to help with your package

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:30,330
and we should help going to maintain our

00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:34,239
packages so that means collaborating on

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:38,190
release like notify exam of important

00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:41,710
present transitions because it's a bit

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,359
well often we we have some transitions

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,460
that are not completely ended with

00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,129
dependencies in debian and it's

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,320
important for them to be notified that

00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:52,149
they know that fast something big coming

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,009
and should be yes they should be

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:59,619
prepared and also yeah we should try to

00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:01,239
force some packages where it's actually

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:03,669
possible because we have enough time to

00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:05,049
do it we should try to do blog fledging

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:09,039
and fits in directly in launchpad

00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,570
instead of waiting for bags to flow back

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:16,280
to the language which doesn't really

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:18,980
happen and we should also

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:23,660
allege that some high quality work is

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:27,500
done Ubuntu and often we tend in debian

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:31,720
to ignore that and just to redo the work

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,700
ourselves our way and we should try to

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,160
import the high quality words it is done

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,180
in some areas in ubuntu into debian and

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,220
create collaboration around it and

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,530
Ubuntu has been importing our packages

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,810
for five years there's no reason why we

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,640
couldn't import back some of the

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:54,020
packages where they do a really good

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:58,610
very good job also something that we

00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,320
have been failing to to do is to

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,990
communicate on why Debian is better

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,650
because yes Debian is still better

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,970
because it wasn't we wouldn't be

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,540
developing the gun we'd be developing

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:14,660
ubuntu probably so okay the gun might

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,520
not be better for everybody but we

00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,730
totally fail at communicating that

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,910
Debian is better that's quite well vera

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,030
bradley kuhn at as a few weeks ago when

00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:28,730
he stopped using ubuntu and switch back

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,700
to debian but basically it is the only

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:35,000
one communicating that yes the gun is

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,730
better so let's try to see why the dion

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,560
is better so the gen first has better

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,350
values Vivian is a volunteer-based

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:47,960
project and decisions are taken in the

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,580
open since 17 years ago lastly we have

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,420
been strong advocates of physical

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,950
philosophy ubuntu on the other hand is a

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,610
project that is controlled by canonical

00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:00,770
company some decisions some important

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,430
decisions are imposed by canonical and

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:07,160
was no way for the community to overrule

00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:10,070
these decisions where they could the

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:13,280
committee could try but usually I start

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,860
really it's quite clear that there is no

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,970
way for them to overrules of decisions

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:22,760
for example there was a debate about 12

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,370
1 which is a web service that allows

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,070
going to users to store data

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:31,340
on the internet and that's a proprietary

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,140
web service so well debate about the

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,750
naming because they use ubuntu name

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,580
which for proprietary service kind of

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,120
strange that could have didn't go

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,309
canonical one as i was the sole recently

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,590
to switch to yahoo search so that phone

00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,690
is interesting because it's a the

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,210
manager to the desktop team just melt

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,210
into devil saying we are switching to

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,460
yahoo search because it will in it will

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,429
allow us to generate a new revenue

00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,309
stream bo canonical and there's no way

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:03,950
for once i was discussion after that but

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,740
of course it's not something that you

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,280
can discuss when you are going to give a

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,870
community win to developer so yeah

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,690
ubuntu advocates proprietary web

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,220
services like kubuntu one I've in vain

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,920
stellar recommends to our proprietary

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,190
software and if you want to contribute

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,679
to projects in stated by canonical you

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,600
have to assign copyright to them like if

00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,300
you want to contribute to app statue

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,020
after a sign copyright which is an issue

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,940
because it's not the same when VFS that

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,070
requires the same thing but we assign in

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,260
copyright to the piece of a foundation

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,990
is not the same as assigning copyright

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:45,470
to canonical can occur the company's

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:49,250
EFSF has been advocating free software

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:53,000
for almost 30 years so clearly is not

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:56,030
the same problem but begin is also a

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,010
better distributions in debian all

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:00,590
packages are maintained except of fun

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,080
packages but they are not so many often

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:10,429
packages many maintainer in debian

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:12,530
expert of their packages if you take for

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,960
example scientific software maintainer

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,270
for scientific software are really using

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,600
it you are using that software daily and

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,320
a really expert for it invest on showing

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,990
emphasis on quality in debian in ubuntu

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,270
most packages week at Sweetwater the

00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,480
packages are just synced from debian so

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,760
where's actually no week no

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,030
acknowledgement will expect eyes on the

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,809
ooman to side about most packages so if

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,309
you have a bug

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:45,499
juice packages might be that they synced

00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:47,749
it from debian automatically at the bad

00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:50,360
time and the fix is already available in

00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:55,549
debian since three months ago and nobody

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:59,029
noticed it or was ads acknowledged on o2

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:04,269
to fix it in ubuntu and that uh turns

00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:07,389
very frequently and so people are using

00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:09,470
Ubuntu envelope top but i think that

00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:11,840
debian testing is really the perfect

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,690
distribution for your laptop event I

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,360
don't know many people using debian

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:20,720
stable envelop that I think Olga still

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,950
does that ok some people do here but a

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,009
deviant testing is really where you get

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,649
to verisign software and you get quite a

00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:32,119
few quite a few problems of course but

00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,789
still there are those problems that you

00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:37,820
get an interesting and useful ones that

00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:40,460
is a testing is closing close enough to

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,710
the upstream projects was not so much

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,840
delay between upstream religious and

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,909
when the package arrived in testing at

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,960
when you report a bug it's still at a

00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:52,940
useful time if you use ubuntu stable you

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,249
get at least a six-month delay between

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,119
the new extreme release and the package

00:31:55,249 --> 00:32:00,619
get some wind to stable so that's almost

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,539
no point in reporting the back upstream

00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:05,149
probably it has been fixed a long time

00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:08,809
ago upstream when the dentist in years

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:11,299
is a way to detect issues reasonably

00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:17,659
early while still having a very usable

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:19,100
system with very few problems so to

00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:22,249
conclude so I think I have something

00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:25,159
like ten minutes left so we can discuss

00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:27,740
it a bit I think that we can't ignore

00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,200
moon to it's really important that as

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:36,309
debian we acknowledge that are going to

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:38,929
exist and other other position on ubuntu

00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:40,759
we can't fight ubuntu because that

00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:42,230
wouldn't be the right thing to do to

00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,909
improve this if you want to improve free

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,049
software which is the thing that most

00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:50,690
ladies are interested in and win 2 is

00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,900
really a chance for debian i think in

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,370
which would leverage it

00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,660
to get back in the center of the floor

00:32:53,370 --> 00:33:00,690
ecosystem and we should work like with

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,510
ubuntu like a good upstream that is we

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,720
should be we should talk to them

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:09,420
communicate with them about transitions

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,990
back in a package burg Epsom fix the

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:16,050
bugs in ubuntu Luke you should also be

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:18,620
more vocal about ubuntu problems but

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:21,030
siesta in constructive not being

00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,830
companies and brightening completely

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,350
inflammatory block plus blog post but

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,800
that's a way that can criticize what

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:32,180
they do without being without starting

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,310
to many flame wars and this could also

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,640
help improve ubuntu and free software

00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:42,240
the world and i think that we can't just

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:46,040
be vocal about ubuntu because if we if

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,600
we start by if we if we ever going to

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:54,300
get to be in a position to criticize

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:56,910
them as well we can't well we can get to

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,070
be where friend but still be able to say

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,340
them when they do something wrong okay

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,340
thank you

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:37,960
questions comments now doesn't work okay

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:42,200
no it's nice and you talked about

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,679
collaborating at the very back tracking

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,590
system level and I'm asking magnetin

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,169
expert but is there some kind of a pea

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,790
between a launch pad are they under the

00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:56,750
gun bug tracking system because you

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,290
talked about a small widget that tracks

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,180
there they want to they want to

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,310
producing of different packages but I

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,360
don't know whether that's a nappy or

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:12,890
some kind of introduce systems work

00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:16,190
together so there's a way to press an

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:19,730
API for a launch pad as you can create

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,280
launch pad using rest as a web service

00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,950
to get information about packages and

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,200
bags but well you can write scripts

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:30,770
script using that it's quite slow so

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,630
it's not the right way to fetch all bags

00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,130
in ubuntu for example it works if you

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,170
have two packages want to get the list

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,810
of bags just packages that would work

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:42,770
but if you have more than 200 bags it

00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:44,600
gets really slow Easter that's just a

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,390
way to get information from launch pad

00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,360
then we're getting a linking of the two

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,420
bug trackers we have something on the

00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,800
debian side code God BTS link I'm not

00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:02,000
sure if it supports launchpad properly

00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,040
it was a Berg some time ago in lunch

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,070
pads are also other way to link bugs

00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,350
moon to barracks 2 billion bags but the

00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,290
problem is that that works if you have a

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:14,420
to barracks fired in both projects and

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:17,000
you want to link them together and no be

00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,230
notified when the status changed but in

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,140
most cases that just one bag

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,030
bhuntu norberg in debian so the

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,490
maintainer indian doesn't know about the

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,970
bug in ubuntu until someone forwards the

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:33,030
burg in debian so the person is a bug in

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:36,210
launchpad and so the game antenna just

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,910
doesn't know about it so for that

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,980
there's no real author solutions and

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:45,140
post didn't meet Anna to go to launch

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,140
pad and have a look at the list of bugs

00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,290
I think a launch pad automatically sends

00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:58,070
you an email as a debian developer if

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:58,070
our bar is filed in a window know how

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,130
well i am a debian developer and i have

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,890
an accounting i will do and I have

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,660
received such emails yes that's because

00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,720
you are subscribed to the package in

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:16,590
launchpad you can do that but you are

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,410
ready for you don't get mad I'm not sure

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:22,470
what Debian developers would think of

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,690
whoops of adding such a service probably

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,609
must there would be some complain maybe

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:30,480
we could do add something like that and

00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:32,869
send mail using the pts as an additional

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,869
service

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,200
ok so I'm I have a question about your

00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:48,560
expertise on the Ubuntu side of the

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,540
let's say issue so you said that

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,579
publicly is really well advertised to

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,859
contribute back to debian like in my

00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,160
guess in the code of conduct at the UDS

00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,930
or whatever i'm wondering if it is

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,109
enforced in some way within the

00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,339
community i mean if you it's if people

00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:07,079
in the window community discover that

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,310
you have not forwarded something to Deb

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,660
you know that you're not trying to give

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,030
something back to Devon do you have some

00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,690
kind of peer pressure that unfortunate

00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:18,119
that run well okay I think so yeah in

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:22,640
the community it's quite easy to check

00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:25,710
with this public and yeah i think that

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,670
example when someone wants to add a new

00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:31,410
application to new package to to open to

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,869
most of the times that get towed to try

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,329
to package it in debian first it's not

00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,369
always the case because often when you

00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:41,430
try to find a sponsor and deb young is

00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:44,460
really hard to find a sponsor but I

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,200
think that's yeah that's sweet yeah and

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,920
it's documented like that as well and

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,339
ubuntu vici yeah from talking to my

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,720
shuttle with regularly um he's made a

00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,130
point to saying every time we talked

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,740
that he is pressing his people

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,319
explicitly to contribute back to debian

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,300
wherever they can he wants us to work

00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:10,710
more closely together obviously you know

00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:13,170
it helps everybody so um we want to be a

00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,760
good upstream to boone zoo but the fact

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,619
is the sad fact is that there are bad

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,240
downstream because most of their

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,329
packages like it's at seventy-four

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,599
percent they have no maintain errs and

00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:26,369
the bags never get forwarded to us

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,720
because there's no one taking care of

00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:31,050
the Bible reviewing them and then for

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,420
loading them up upstream so for most of

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,940
the packages there there are abandoned

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,950
or unmaintained or whatever you want to

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,569
use the temple but they're dug

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:43,140
downstream and there's nothing we can do

00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:45,150
about it but Jeremy going to to join the

00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,720
lunch pardoned and review back there

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:50,700
which is not very fair for us to do well

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,920
most of the bugs in

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:58,320
ubuntu well some I don't know about the

00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:01,349
VoIP team specificities but most of the

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,089
bugs in wind to also apply or applied to

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:04,980
baby on at some point yeah but you have

00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:06,690
to go into launch button seeds I'm all

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,670
those with all pts and have the habit

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,890
integrate haven't have a boon to degrade

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,900
into our pts so we can see the bugs

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,910
because we don't get them on our bug

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,060
tracking system yeah we don't expect

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,770
known to go into bags debian org and see

00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,230
the buggies and reply there and fix them

00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,329
there yeah now I'm not talking I'm not

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,070
asking to do that for all packages but I

00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:28,650
don't know about number of persons or

00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,560
your packages but for some of my

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:34,230
packages i have like one backfired

00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,730
diamonds and two bucks five months in

00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,560
ubuntu and most of the backside in

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,579
ubuntu also applied to debian package

00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,190
which just a nobody in debian fired the

00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,500
file time yeah so those are interesting

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,810
bugs for me and i'd like to fix them

00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,630
because as I met her to both

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,490
distributions and just if you had ten

00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,890
boom to ten downstream I mean now

00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,650
there's miami that's a bit ubuntu is

00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,690
michelle i mean you can't say you can

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,540
say that won't we just another at the

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:06,089
gin derivative they are like ninety-five

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,760
percent of at least net five percent of

00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:12,930
the user base of our derivative so i

00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:16,410
think that we can special case bhuntu

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:21,060
and try to have a look at web web

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:25,349
tracker I mean what which other big the

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,960
beyond rivet if do we have I'm thinking

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:30,990
about other derivatives that may come up

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,760
in the future like my mo yeah but maybe

00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,130
it's at some point we'll have a mailbox

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:44,980
and we have 22 big didn't derivatives

00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:48,770
but maybe memo is not saying yet sorry

00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,140
in Brazil Azza WA life distribution for

00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:53,000
education with 30 million users yeah but

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,340
so there I'm there quite there are other

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,790
big to school they were to be don't hear

00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:01,310
from them about development so as a

00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:04,100
point is not about the row number of

00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:07,820
users also a number of users report bugs

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,680
were web expertise required to report

00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:13,430
bugs I'm not I didn't know about that

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,620
distribution and maybe yeah maybe we

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:19,130
could have a list of big the beyond

00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:23,230
derivative that a as Vincent moons said

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:28,820
yes it said said yesterday is talk about

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:33,230
we know in some instance is a gnome r is

00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:36,440
manager and in it tracks as Apaches send

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:39,140
mail to Nome packages in some

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,860
distributions and it doesn't check exam

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,470
for 100 distributions it Shh exam for

00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,900
something five of 10 main distributions

00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,780
and if we have five or ten men the young

00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:55,880
relative but still manageable to have a

00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,770
look at them and help Sam and and we are

00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,990
currently we have one where we have that

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,480
problem when we have five we can discuss

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:05,870
again find the most clever solutions but

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,640
I don't see any the point was that

00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,400
they're bad dansgame they're popular but

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,020
they're not doing the job right but that

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,380
would maybe yeah we're not doing our job

00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:18,140
right for many packages as well sure so

00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:25,190
not for the same example 75% of four

00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:34,460
packages oh yeah but well I'm not sure

00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:37,250
maybe no not 75 sure but they bring

00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,500
other things and what does I don't have

00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:43,610
infinite resource and as we don't have

00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:46,250
emphasis as they are just I mean it's

00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,860
really a shame that they are not so much

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,150
lot more Ubuntu developers coming to

00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,880
further on because I the development

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,370
sprint at the same time but really

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,490
they're just like us I mean there's no

00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:03,080
no reason to to see them that different

00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:07,330
so usually that a nice guy not all of

00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:11,240
them but I could say seven dead young

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:15,530
and i mean i'm askin cause you ready to

00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:19,040
the bug tracking system LG turn you said

00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,750
that almost three-quarters of ubuntu

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,600
packages are very greatly imported from

00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,760
there and without any important

00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,910
modification good weather in those cases

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,940
at least that people willing to feel

00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:34,340
back in a bun tool to be redirected to

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,619
the debian bug tracking system in order

00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:39,800
to into the area because there's no

00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:43,550
window maintainer it's a semester

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,020
another question I'm not sure all good

00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,350
young developers would feel about that

00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,690
because some birds can be caused by

00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:53,030
difference in the rest of the system so

00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,760
for example is all some bags can be

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,260
caused by a difference in other packages

00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,200
that could be different in going to

00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,610
compare to Debian like you could have an

00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,670
application that fails to build in

00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:08,510
ubuntu because the compiler is different

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:11,330
in ubuntu and debian so that bug should

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,220
not be filed directly to the young at

00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,720
some point probably it's it's a it's an

00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,670
interesting work for us because means

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,050
that when we will update GCC as well

00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:22,640
we'll run into that bug but by default I

00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:26,359
don't think that's a good idea to file

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,420
bugs there's also a lot of people are

00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,790
talking about linking links between

00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:34,580
backpackers where they work on projects

00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,810
in Paris at Sequoia I mean for a

00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,780
versatile probably specifically

00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:41,540
participating in that project so it's

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,880
likely zapped in the next year's will

00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:47,660
get the outcome of such efforts and

00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:51,980
there will be easier ways to share data

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:57,410
between bug trackers on this to get two

00:45:51,980 --> 00:46:00,740
questions oh alright I've been told for

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:04,850
a launch pad account for a Debian

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:08,380
developers should mark ok IMA wa

00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:11,019
developer is a

00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:14,349
one if so could you tell me more about

00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:19,150
that and I don't know anything about

00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:21,099
that no okay thank you s no special

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:23,079
status for Debian developers and lunch

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:31,299
fat burners bad i think that's no

00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:38,619
specific yeah but is it used make me I

00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:40,210
don't yeah I don't think there's any

00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:48,299
special ride for the BN developers

00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:48,299
English as another question just tours

00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:58,829
ah it seems to me that your buns who

00:46:55,089 --> 00:47:03,490
needs debian more than debian ubuntu

00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:05,769
generally and you burn to users the way

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,329
i see it are not necessarily debian uses

00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:09,039
and in five or ten years time there's

00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:13,029
nothing to guarantee that they will be

00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:14,710
so why should Debian developers put in

00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:18,180
the extra effort to support a project

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:21,670
that isn't theirs ultimately yeah um

00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,500
sorry what does in its cage would you

00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,930
repeat the end of the question you can

00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,789
get the less I just said so so why

00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:29,740
should he been developers as a whole be

00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:31,720
expected to contribute to a project that

00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:36,069
that isn't theirs and I have no control

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:41,380
over well I think that's a real final

00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:43,990
goal is not to have debian win that

00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,259
battle and the goal is to get a better

00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,710
free software in general and not just

00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:52,900
improve debian and the currently past 12

00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,329
which is a really important distribution

00:47:52,900 --> 00:48:01,720
especially for new linux users 12 is not

00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:08,579
perfect fairly lots of problems ubuntu

00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:12,069
users run into and we have the power to

00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:16,599
ya but I mean person okay should I stop

00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:19,089
all okay so i can I mean there's no talk

00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,579
just after me I think like

00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:28,210
I'm a bit so if you want to live you can

00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:31,420
live so what's the thing yeah bhuntu is

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:34,269
a thing going to its special currently

00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,979
and we we have the power to AB Sam and

00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:37,390
the right thing to do to help them

00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:40,299
because it's improved free software the

00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:42,910
world but clearly went with not perfect

00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:44,229
as well both from values and a point of

00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,509
view and from a distribution point of

00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:48,519
view when we need to wait to say to

00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:52,210
communicate that much more than we

00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,339
currently do so people learn about the

00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:58,799
difference and what the kind of values

00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:58,799
