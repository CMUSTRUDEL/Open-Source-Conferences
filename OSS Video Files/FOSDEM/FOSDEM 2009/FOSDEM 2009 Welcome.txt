I to this ninth edition of our little

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,389
conference and I have a horrible echo on

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,389
this microphone

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,110
yeah if you ask a conference organizer

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,689
what they like best about a conference

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,300
you will get two answers depending on

00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,849
when you ask them if you ask them during

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,360
the conference they will say in a bit of

00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,950
a grumpy voice the day after but if you

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,120
ask them after the conference or a

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,040
couple of months before the conference

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,750
they'll say I like doing the opening

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,160
talk it gives me a chance to talk to all

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,829
these people who are expecting something

00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:46,690
interesting and making them wait so yeah

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,480
I wanted to do a long opening talk but

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,070
it's going to be a short one again so I

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,700
would like my next slide from my

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:59,260
assistant and not that one that one good

00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,260
but wife of the conference organizing as

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,390
one of recurring nightmares last night

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,509
or the night before last I didn't sleep

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,090
I was thinking what if no one shows up

00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:12,220
how unbelievably stupid will I feel if I

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,740
am at the bar all alone no one will be

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,869
there or what will it feel like to talk

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,080
to an empty auditorium it's well not

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:22,960
quite empty with not full enough and

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,960
then after the nightmare phase there is

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,030
the firefighting phase the beer event

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,260
last night I'll talk a bit about it

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:35,229
later went fairly well but after i gots

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,140
to the couch i was surfing my phone

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,090
started ringing and it's kept ringing

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,210
that's amazing how many things can go

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,190
wrong when you organize a conference and

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,920
then of course there's the solution to

00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,920
all this it's caffeine there's lots of

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,890
its Leslie tells me it tastes bad but

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,010
it's caffeine and then there's the

00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,820
adrenaline you know keep us going so

00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,790
this conference would not be possible

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,500
without our sponsors we've got the usual

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,930
suspects up there for whom we are

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,030
eternally grateful O'Reilly has their

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,650
stand with books Josette has lots of

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,290
lots of books there's even a book about

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,209
a small dogs so I don't know what that

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,170
does in our shipment but she's got it

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,819
and then novel is cornerstone sponsors

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,180
as well and then we've got all these are

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,400
nice people

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,560
net worthy is cisco who are doing

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,709
wireless you see these people over there

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,260
they are not quite smiling yet once they

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,030
start smiling the wireless is working

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,159
there's currently a captive portal which

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,379
speaks ssl with a self-signed

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,909
certificates i suggest you ask one of

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,040
the cisco guys for the fingerprints

00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:49,790
before you trust it because it is you

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,829
know mozilla will complain last night we

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,170
had a little beer event it was little

00:02:51,829 --> 00:03:00,590
and Google was kind enough to sponsor

00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:03,620
some free beer we like that very much so

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,329
in addition to the sponsors we like

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,280
donations we actually love their nations

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,290
this year we made the donation form

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,530
easier so you can donate more and more

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,629
easily we've got beautiful t-shirts with

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,150
a new local with lots of cloudy things

00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,680
and Brady things the usual O'Reilly

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,590
books and pockets if you donate enough

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,989
and then tomorrow we will do our annual

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,840
notorious the nation's draw there are

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,569
some nokia gadgets to win again some bug

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,010
labs gadgets with arm CPUs you plug them

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,560
together and they do shiny things for

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,590
you and then there's the more books and

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,239
pocket-sized it gets 5 books you can win

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,889
two times five books so if you're very

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,139
lucky you have lots of things to read

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,389
and magazine subscriptions in various

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,430
languages so due dates much and their

00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:51,169
date often and get a free t-shirt and

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,340
share it or everyone so this beer event

00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:57,500
of mine how many people were to be

00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:03,680
ravens okay how many of you are somewhat

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:06,889
hungover mmm same crowds yes nine years

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,299
ago I have this bright idea of you know

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:10,639
if people are going to show up at the

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,159
conference on time we won't have time to

00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,479
set up the conference people will want

00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,479
to use wireless network and there won't

00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,070
be wireless network so let's treat these

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,930
people to a beer somewhere in the center

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,169
of Brussels and get them hung over so

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,259
they show up a bit later that idea

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,990
backfired slightly every year we bust

00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:32,330
some records which are on the next slide

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,340
if it's can get there

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,380
did anyone try to count how many people

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,100
were in there according to fire

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,650
regulations about 750 should fit in a

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,050
bar at one time of course we have the

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,360
bar and the bar across the roads and the

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,650
roads and the road next to the road and

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,010
I think there were people downstairs

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,490
probably oozing into other streets so

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,640
many people and my beer distribution

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,860
algorithm version 3.0 incorporating free

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,830
beer as a storm control system you just

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,900
have to be there worked very well we had

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,680
a total bill of not quite 10,000 theater

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,840
when i left at midnight and a three

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,390
o'clock one of my phone calls was from a

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,100
Swiss gentleman who asked me does it

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,950
still make sense to go to the beer event

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,570
at this time yeah probably let me know

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,340
if there's any people left and then ten

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,110
people then minutes later he called me

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,680
back and I said it's felt backed with

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,020
people here so yeah I think the total

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,930
bill was something to be proud of thank

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,660
you and thank you google for sponsoring

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:43,020
free beer wherever leslie is there says

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:44,730
e 3 BRS goods we like trivia so so that

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,240
was the philosophical part of this

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,310
opening talk at the info desk you find

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,410
these little booklets the booklet is

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,620
your friends it has everything you need

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,360
to know about the conference in it

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,030
there's practical information about just

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,120
about everything there are talks cages

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,360
which are somewhat up-to-date with

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,660
reality if I keep talking too long then

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,340
they get out of sync there's an area map

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,710
in there as well if you get hungry we

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,210
have our Belgian fries somewhere out

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,810
here and then there's all the local

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,190
establishment with tasty stuff for you

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,950
the network as I've mentioned is still

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,729
in a state of flux I still don't see any

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:29,490
particularly smiley faces but you know

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,919
the sins good vibes to them a little

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,410
work there is a I mentioned the captive

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,300
portal if that works it will point you

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,390
to any last minute announcements which

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,210
we might like to make like fire fire and

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,250
things like up the essid is forced them

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,780
with a capital F and small other letters

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,639
for

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,020
reasons unknown to me and well oh yes I

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,600
was going to say things about new things

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,430
the last minute slide we have a

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,080
cloakroom this year you can just leave

00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,940
your valuable stuff in there we're not

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,700
exactly responsible for it but we will

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,220
try to keep them safe there's a shuttle

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,550
service to the south station Sunday

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,830
evening there's times and booklets they

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,320
may or may not reflect reality but we'll

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,650
do our best to make them reflect reality

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,480
and if you get lost confused or arrested

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,230
during the events you can call this

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,720
number and we will try to well unconfuse

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,010
and unleash you we don't know if you can

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,010
do anything about arrested that we will

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:32,450
certainly try and I think that concludes

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:35,120
my talk that's it no it doesn't oh yes

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,850
we don't like trash we hate cleaning up

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,220
after conference we are not your mother

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,900
but you know use common sense and if you

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,479
see something roaming around which

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,940
shouldn't be roaming find a bin and put

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,550
it in there so that really does conclude

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,590
my talk and before I hand you over to

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,410
the capable hands of our real keynote

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,970
speaker mark sermons Simon wanted to say

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,650
something interesting from a sunny

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,820
software company who also happens to

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:04,669
sponsor us but here is Simon I'm sort of

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:10,250
setting out the laptop for market it's

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:11,660
laptop bounced a while well yeah while

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,669
we were waiting for this left of thing

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,010
the laptop dance will do the first in

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,260
dance so can I ask him/her over the

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,169
yellow t-shirts to come join us for the

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:27,370
custom dance that's we've been doing the

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,370
first and last for lunch down thank you

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,490
if some visitors also want to join us

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,490
they are free to do it

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:02,510
did that give you enough time yes it did

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:07,580
there we go ok so we're running a bit

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,320
late but I'm Ling fast moving fast but

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:15,070
don't worry this is first half an hour

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:18,530
break so ok so I've been tolerated for a

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,330
just a brief room up here because we're

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,600
worried that you know you might still

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,340
have a hangover I'd like to just talk to

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,880
you briefly about the problems of

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,070
long-term success unfortunately I think

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,970
that the free and open source movement

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,350
is beginning to suffer from let me try

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,870
to explain what I mean by those things

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:45,380
at 25 years ago last November Richard

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,940
was starting the GU new project he had

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,380
made you've written the GPL at that

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,010
stage that was something was going to

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,040
come 25 years ago this year before he

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:58,180
did all that there were some other folks

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,680
who were working on some other code and

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,770
they were working on a piece of code

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,040
that made computers work over networks

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:11,090
and we're talking here about deep

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:17,240
history about stuff that that works in

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:19,220
the distant unknown past and when we

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,430
look back at the things we did all those

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,800
years ago to license the code that we

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,250
wrote 27 years ago that is still in

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,260
Linux it wasn't necessarily licensed in

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,730
quite the way that seems appropriate

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,250
these days in particular there is some

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,520
code that's been hanging around in the

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:45,020
linux kernel for oh i don't know how

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,280
long that does some interesting things i

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:51,500
don't know whether you've got if you've

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,330
run into this code the onc RPC code has

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,380
been in existence i think the reference

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,420
implementation is now 29 years old and

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,600
it still has the original license on it

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,520
from 29 years ago just to put that into

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,920
perspective for you that predates the

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,430
bsd license

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,980
it comfortably predates the GPL now the

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,130
license that went on that code 25 years

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,980
ago was the the most liberal code you

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,800
license you can possibly imagine if you

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,070
are living 29 years ago it says

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,410
basically you look use this code but

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,959
please don't try and make a profit off

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,329
it because well unless you're going to

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,620
build it into something else that's fine

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,760
that's what the license basically says

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,029
now a number of years ago some fine

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
people on the Debian legal mailing list

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,899
discovered that this license was still

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,930
in there you'll notice that this this

00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:52,820
bug here was opened in 2002 and this is

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,180
so this is this is itself coming up for

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,490
a substantial birthday what happened

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,149
back there in 2002 is that the the fine

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,040
guys from debian got in touch with

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,329
Denise Cooper who was doing my job at

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,089
some back in those days and say excuse

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:12,529
me would you mind relicensing this sun

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:15,500
RPC code over to something which is d

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:21,410
FSG free it is that is the license down

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:22,940
here and so we looked at this and let me

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,240
explain to you what happens when you

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,730
asked me to relicense a piece of code I

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,490
have to find someone who knows what

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,050
you're talking about and that isn't

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,250
necessarily easy with a piece of code

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,839
that was written in 1982 because the

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,089
person who wrote it probably isn't with

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,550
the company anymore the piece of code

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:47,120
actually well no one owns it in Sun

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,550
because the version of a Sun RPC that's

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,550
in debian is actually a derivative of a

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,740
derivative of a derivative and so the

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,690
code that's in there has got an embedded

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,110
license statement that comes from years

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,279
and years ago so with this piece of code

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,860
we looked at it and so we have no idea

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,680
where that's from and so the bug that

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,680
the request inside son went to sleep we

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,990
hope that everyone would forget about it

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,540
and I needy people did for a number of

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,449
years if you if you look back at debian

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,700
bug 1814 93 you'll find it kind of went

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:21,040
to sleep for a really long

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,220
time and then last year it woke up again

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,290
and I got an email saying so look we're

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,390
going to take this code out of Debian if

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,850
you don't realize it and so I said well

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:35,620
where is this code he said well it's in

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,420
poor lib and it's in G lipsy so so

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:44,380
you're going to take gillip see out of

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:46,930
linux okay so we got some some lawyers

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,150
working on this big problem because it's

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,730
not actually code that my company uses

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,260
in any product at the moment there's no

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,910
product group to pay the lawyers and

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,500
there's no engineer who knows the code

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,020
to tell the lawyers what to actually go

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,430
and investigate so I had a bunch of

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,940
people working their spare time for

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:06,160
about 3-4 months trying to work out

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,990
where this code comes from I'm delighted

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,040
to be able to give you a room up today

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:15,730
to tell you that I two days ago I was

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,010
told we can rely since the Sun RPC code

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,290
so that it can get shipped in fedora and

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,870
hey if you fancy changing G lipsy a week

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,100
before release in Lenny you do want to

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:30,180
change Caleb's here we can fall release

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,180
don't you say yes no no so we've done

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,400
it's it's always good to celebrate

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:43,510
occasions so you know this is the this

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:52,480
is the birthday of this bug and that's

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:55,050
when i'll be down here and so we could

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,050
have a little celebration

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,860
it turns out that we can all live in

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,810
happen incident harmony from here I've

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,760
got another problem to solve so excuse

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,010
me for a few weeks while I don't fix the

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,680
next bug that Vidal has lined up for me

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,060
out of the Debian database I've

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,580
discovered that we've got to change

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,140
son's terms of employment so that our

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,730
employees can contribute to open source

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,920
communities we should have done that

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,570
maybe five years ago but we turned up

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,209
when we bought mysql that we had a

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,100
problem so i hope to be able to come

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,480
back to phones down next year and tell

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,520
you how I've changed our terms of

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,440
employment so all 30,000 employees can

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,260
join open source communities but this I

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,620
have to do for now so without any

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:40,339
further ado I will see whether the this

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,930
computer is working here for mark yeah

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,930
