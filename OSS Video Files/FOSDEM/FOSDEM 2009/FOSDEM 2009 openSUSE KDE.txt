so let's begin hello everyone thank you

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
for coming my name is Will Stephenson

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm a member of the KDE team at opensuse

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,960
and I'd like to talk to you about how

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,640
we're changing our development model to

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,160
make it more friendly and more open more

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,400
accessible to the Grand community and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,520
get there your input and hopefully

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,340
motivate you to join us we're a small

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,920
friendly community we're made up of a

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,270
mixture of longtime long-term KD

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,390
contributors and veteran users and few

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,800
new faces and we think that 2009 is a

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,719
real exciting year here on the free

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,930
desktop there's lots of stuff going on

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,850
it's a great time to get involved and we

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,140
do contribute there are a lot of things

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,059
that are going to be good for you and

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,930
good for the community so here's some

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,309
reasons when I was writing this talk i

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,600
sat down I thought why am I why do I

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,740
actually do free software why do I

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,390
contribute to speak from experience well

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,030
it's software that I can change to

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,740
exactly my taste I can make it do just

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,080
what I want if I put the time into it

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,869
and it's going to be interesting and

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,970
useful for me to use its software that

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,939
won't just fall to pieces that won't

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,860
expire that won't stop working when i

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,560
upgrade my operating system because free

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,549
software it can be maintained by anyone

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,140
who wants to work with it and it

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,869
software this easy communicate with the

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,259
developers you can go out there you can

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,380
find these people you can work together

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,799
with them get their feedback on your

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,659
ideas and that makes it all a pleasant

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,020
experience to work with you don't fit

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,390
fine you're talking to a brick wall

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,259
you're sending support emails never get

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,020
answered and you build a relationship

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,640
with a software

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,229
as a result you get all these people

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
working together and you get softer that

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,660
meet everyone's needs then my

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,830
interacting all these people you're out

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,560
there you meeting people from all over

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,550
the world you're improving your skills

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,349
you have a chance to share your

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,840
expertise and and pass it on to the

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,250
people around the world and the end

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,790
result and this is what really does it

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,209
for me personally is that week together

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:40,709
create a common good a body of work

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:42,989
which is useful and out there in the

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,630
world for anyone to take to use for

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,630
their purposes to make better and that

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,069
really inspires me and it's not just

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,390
something that ends up going as a small

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:57,030
plus on someone share price when I use

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,829
my software that I've helped write or

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,360
software that I've reported the bug on

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,360
and I've seen it fixed in the next

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,540
release of opensuse it just gives me a

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,040
buzz it makes me feel like I've got a

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,269
something I can do in the world that

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,269
makes the world a better place and

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:19,799
frankly it's a little ego boost so

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,079
contribution has loads of benefits you

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,760
improve your skills you get your name

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:29,430
known you get in touch with a lot of

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,500
people from around the world you improve

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,569
your skills in a in a down economy it's

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,280
actually great time for open source an

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,459
open source is great for people say who

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,889
are leaving university who were looking

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,660
for a job or anything you can polish

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:50,250
those skills make a visible and

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,599
curriculum vitae that is real benefit to

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,599
you when you're looking for a job and it

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,340
just makes your life easier the using

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,139
the software it just becomes fun because

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,799
you know it's tweaked exactly how you

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:08,090
want it and also I'd like to show you

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,209
how participation is in fact essential

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,160
if we look at the opensuse models to say

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,519
five years ago well I'll say open suse

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,870
it's actually just souza five years ago

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,579
need a bunch of hackers and enthusiasts

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,019
making software

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,180
for people like them for hackers an

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,789
enthusiast and that worked great it was

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,349
just stickity boo every six months re

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,939
every nine months we put down a new box

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:33,930
with a new fancy geometric shape I it

00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,949
everyone updated and it went but

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,289
nowadays things are a little bit

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,870
different sure we have more hackus

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:46,289
enthusiasts but we also have moms there

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,469
there there reading their fat doing

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,520
their family recipe websites they're

00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,219
keeping in touch with our friends from

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,780
school they're participating online

00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:57,599
communities they're uploading their kid

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,330
photo albums to Flickr and all the other

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:03,080
photo websites you've got the power

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,129
users these the guys who maybe aren't

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,659
developers and such but they're the guys

00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,069
who really know how to like to take an

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,139
operating system and tweak exactly how

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:14,789
they like it and that may be coming to

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:19,080
Linux from windows we've got the

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:22,189
students these guys who smart people but

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,189
they really want to get the latest

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,039
videos and things on YouTube they want

00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,590
to use all the social networking

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,319
websites they've got a very online

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,909
experience all these groups are using

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,889
things using software completely

00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:37,889
differently and we got the suits their

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,219
the enterprise users they're seeing the

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,900
opensuse as a base for make doing a

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:49,319
powerful enterprise software and in back

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,650
in the day we had 150 guys in their 30s

00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,479
in nuremberg in germany who knew exactly

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,659
what they wanted they wanted a really

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:02,339
good busybox black box or a rat poison

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:06,060
and an ex console our CI and view other

00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,349
bits and pieces but in order to make a

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,819
piece of software that really reach

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,770
meets the needs of all these different

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,150
disparate groups we need as much

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,460
participation from all these different

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,259
groups as possible so this is what

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,219
growing community is all about it's

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,330
reaching out so only people do have from

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:25,699
each with different groups we have some

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,810
students here with one student here okay

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,459
we've got some definitely got some

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,569
hackers and enthusiasts I know quite a

00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,679
few of you

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:37,649
we forgot any moms know mums it's Sunday

00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:39,659
afternoon so they're probably doing

00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,459
something with the kids I know we've got

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:46,800
a few enterprise people to I know you

00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:48,990
guys so if any of this touches our nerve

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,759
this if this means something to you

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,770
think about this model and think about

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,729
how you can make the make the pool of

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,110
people who work with opensuse who

00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,319
participate and give back to it just a

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,490
little bit larger here's another

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,499
metaphor free software is the highway

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,159
its motorway that creates all these

00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:12,419
benefits that we want to die spoke about

00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,219
in the first slides that we want to

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,169
create an in the world make soft it's

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,119
useful participation is the engine

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,399
that's the means by which we drive it

00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:21,689
forward and contributing into the engine

00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,089
is what keeps the engine turning over

00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,999
what keeps new improvements coming out

00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:30,089
there and also it's a question of

00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:32,610
democratic participation if we only have

00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,599
a small core of people who have their

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,029
own particular interest to a

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,539
contributing but we have the software

00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:40,860
which is used by all these people it's

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,029
not going to be very democratic it's

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,389
going to be going in one particular

00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,919
direction so in order to keep this

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,149
democratic process going we need to keep

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,729
on looking at and expanding the

00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:55,079
participant groups anyway you came here

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,869
to hear about KDE I guess so this is a

00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:01,949
little diagram I drew to show how we've

00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:05,459
started to introduce KD and KD 4 in on

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,439
souza so the bottom we've got the

00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,819
different versions of opensuse on the

00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:14,749
timeline you've also got the versions of

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,749
KD that went with those those lotions &

00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:21,300
2 half years ago we were purely kd3 kt4

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,649
was something that was just barely honor

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,389
her own horizons we were just starting

00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:29,129
packet and as times gone by we've in

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,229
kind of increase the mix of KD 4

00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,000
components and start to take out a few

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,099
KD three things where we think the KD 4

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,680
components have been it ready to replace

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,389
them and this is something that as a

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,709
community has been very important to us

00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:43,190
to communicate what we're doing because

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:46,070
people are very attached their software

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,970
I've talked already about how there are

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,890
so many ways that you can make a

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,230
personal investment in your software and

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,580
that means people really like it so we

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,130
didn't want to do anything which was

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,530
going to take away what people had

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,850
already put into the greatest system

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,350
that they wanted and this was something

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,490
that created a lot of difficulties for

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,990
us because at the time when kaydee

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,500
four-point-oh was released which was

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:17,450
about here the people a lot of people

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,000
had got into a mode of thinking well

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,010
this is very polished it's very good

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,240
it's just like commercial product in

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,670
fact something which i'm just going to

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,600
be able to take and run with and it's

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:32,420
going to everything kd3 did with and for

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,970
good or bad that perception somehow got

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,740
spread around what we're trying to do it

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,900
Cesar when we've talked to I use this

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,080
keep it very clear that we're not going

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,810
to force anyone like a certain guy

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:52,250
called Dennis 12 outs to give up his kd3

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:54,560
too soon so in 10.3 we had a preview of

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,770
a couple of KD games and KD I do

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,730
packages on a kd3 desktop still had the

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,500
KD three equivalents on 11-point oh you

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,960
had Katie four-point-oh point for which

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,030
was put out there as a developer preview

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,580
for everyone to try and use and give us

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:16,130
feedback on still the full kd3 desktop

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,840
when we would come to 11.1 now we've got

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:22,090
four point one on there with a lot of

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,040
tweaks from kit from KD 4.2 backported

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,200
and we start to take out a few KD three

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
things which are completely replaced by

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,290
their kd4 equivalents for example k

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,040
torrents it's already leaps and bounds

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:38,300
ahead of the KD 3 version this is where

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,550
we are now looking forward to 11.2 we're

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,440
going to have an almost fully kd4 system

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,740
hopefully based on Kady 4.3 point

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,850
something and the KD three components

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,410
are going to be take a much less

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,490
prominent role they're still going to be

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,650
available in the build service and

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,820
everything and still have live CDs and

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,350
things available people who want to use

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,510
them

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,100
but as you can see for the last couple

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,510
of years Watchmen maintaining to KD

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,080
versions there's a lot of work and love

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,660
things need to be done and this is how

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,770
we actually do it you're probably all

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,050
familiar with the open close to what

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,180
model but you've got upstream projects

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,280
for example out kd3 in the middle of

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,510
this diagram wrote distributions around

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,830
them they're taking the software and

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,140
putting it together and took here in

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,580
whole and then you've got all these

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,240
users who are taking this and using it

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,640
and this process is the one that we want

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,290
you to get involved in because your

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,180
people who come to foster you know you

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,920
have technical expertise you know what

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,720
you want you know how how how free

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,820
software works also your users you know

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,400
you actually have a stake using software

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,430
you know it works for it so by joining

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,560
in you can add your information

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,030
gathering abilities and your skills to

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:56,690
create some in which useful flood of

00:11:51,030 --> 00:12:02,430
other people and here's some examples I

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:04,350
comes on the desktop in katy 4.1 we had

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,610
a very incomplete implementation a

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,580
four-point-oh we had very incomplete

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,900
icons implementation so you didn't you

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,000
could put icons and desktop didn't work

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,920
as well as you can k d three people got

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,530
very upset by that and they even more so

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,170
when we try to introduce the KD 4.1

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,050
folder view which is we think a much

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,640
better way of organizing those icons but

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,700
a lot of users and especially these were

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,990
the long term mailing list people told

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,070
us that they really liked their icons

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,290
and they really panicked a little bit

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,330
when we thought they were going to the

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:37,350
desktop which was like a mac desktop

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:42,060
completely empty but we are a regular

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,800
meetings we listen to people and we came

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:49,890
up with an accessible alternative which

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:53,550
is the packaging a the play the folder

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,830
view containment and we made that

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,960
accessible then by making it and one

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:03,350
click away we do a default install of

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,350
11.1 from the greeter that comes up

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,800
then we have the cashew toolbox buttons

00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:12,329
everyone know what the cashew is here

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,060
yeah they will not know what the cashew

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:21,170
is here okay I'll demonstrate the cashew

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:23,399
tea so here we have a normal desktop

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:28,110
it's got my wife on it in fact i'll show

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:31,010
you the icons as desktop so this is a

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,510
folder view this is the replacement for

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,370
four icons on the desktop because you

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,649
can change the folder views that are on

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,450
different desktops let's get rid of that

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:47,510
one but if you really want your icons

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:47,510
back you can just choose your

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,850
ah it's a lot of stuff then this is a KD

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:04,470
4.1 desktop so don't want to tell me

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:06,480
what I've done wrong here yep now now

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,660
all the mess is because I have an old

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,040
psycho care of Katie 4.2 on the day on

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,040
this disk which is getting picked up it

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,670
couldn't happen at a better time

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,480
so yeah this is what happens when you

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,890
switch from one version Katie to another

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:37,570
and you have development versions

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:48,820
installed so it's a striker well that

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:50,050
rebuilds itself we add our have this

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,480
thing on the desktop called the cashew

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,970
which is a test desktop tool box which

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,770
allows you to zoom in and out your

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,180
desktop background and switch between

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,700
different versions of your desktop

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:05,290
background and manipulate the desktop so

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,850
you can have for example you could have

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,300
icons on one desktop you could have

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,790
sidebar panels on another desktop and

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,240
you could have on a on a desktop which

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:20,290
is for work you could have a icons which

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,270
are coming say from a ftp site or SMB

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,650
server whereas on your home one you have

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,060
something's on your local disk a

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,860
university one you have something

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:32,640
related to particular courses mr. if I

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,640
can demonstrate that now

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,140
hmm

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,310
so here we have the the cashew this is a

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,959
really going to be maybe in a six months

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,899
time Katie 4.3 comes out an incredibly

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,490
cool feature because as well as just

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,050
having your virtual desktops you can

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,060
also have kind of virtual desktop

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,769
furniture so different sets of icons in

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,529
each desktop so there we go resume out

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:29,760
we've got a different panel we can then

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:31,510
zoom in on this one and you can see the

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,190
picture widget that I've got in the

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:37,300
background is completely different just

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:39,720
as an example add some wickets the

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,720
folder view

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,350
change the location of the desktop

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,630
and they've all got different projects

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,990
on this view and flip onto another

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,990
desktop

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,299
and we're already stuck

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,770
so you can see this is a feature which

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,970
came from upstream and wasn't completely

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,530
finished which for us as the people who

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,200
talk to the end users who make something

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,000
as to everyone has to be able to use is

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,410
not something that we want to put up our

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,669
users through we don't give something

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,450
where you can say oh well what is this

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,669
crazy checkerboard stuff as we all know

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,660
it it's raw plasma but it's not

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:46,210
particularly useful are pretty

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:49,070
particularly pretty so what we did was

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,630
we took out the folder view because

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,820
plasma is very pluggable it's very

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,650
minute it's very customizable we wrote a

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,530
simplified plug-in which removes that

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,690
cashew that that toolbox and takes away

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:04,220
that ability to go into this unfinished

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,130
work and we got a lot of our users to

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,559
try that out and it worked we made it

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:14,240
the standard containment on kd4 for our

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:16,520
opensuse 11.1 and that's another one

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,360
goal which is quite interesting when

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,340
your take becoming part of the team you

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,049
then find yourself talking to the end

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,820
users who don't do anything at all and

00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,260
also to upstream and it can be get

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,640
really hairy because upstream of

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,309
passionate people who are putting in a

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,799
lot of work into making their features

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,000
work exactly as they want but sometimes

00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,110
it just doesn't meet users needs and

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,870
then you've got a bit of conflict there

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,970
so if you want to hone your project

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,440
management skills and your product

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,500
management skills it's a it's a good

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,200
thing to do and then we wrote this plane

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,799
desktop plugin just one knows showing

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,799
there which is

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:05,770
desktop settings and playing desktop no

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:11,130
cashew take it all the way back folder

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:14,830
view get rid of the other widgets landed

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:18,400
and then I cons desktop exactly like in

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,020
kd3 and that's something that we haven't

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,929
had a single bug reports about since

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,250
open sued 11 was released two months ago

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:27,160
so we're pretty happy that in this case

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:34,450
having open transparent development

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:37,210
model has helped and then we got

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:40,150
hardware adaptation problems it's kind

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,230
of obvious you've got we got say k when

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,910
comes it affects here and this is really

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,799
asking for trouble but yeah there you go

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:53,049
it even works on the other unbirth

00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:55,870
displays switching and desktops and we

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:59,770
chose to deploy that by default in in

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,270
opensuse 11.1 but in order to do that we

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,590
needed a lot of testing because there's

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,480
seven different combinations of drivers

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,280
and having that testing having these

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,549
active people in the community really

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,860
let's get that make that work and then

00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:14,710
we had to choose how many plugins how

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,360
many different effects to enable we went

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,100
out we talked to people we found set of

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,590
plugins which was neither so much eye

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,860
candy that you think I need to be 14

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,120
years old to enjoy this and but also set

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,440
of plugins which are actually quite

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,429
useful and support you in your daily

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,130
work so for example and a slight dimming

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,809
of inactive windows enables you to focus

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,690
on the window which are actually working

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:43,240
on and some transparency effects nothing

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,290
in your face but it works network

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,840
management something that we're working

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,980
on for 11.2 same problem you've got a

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,080
lot of different drivers a lot of

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,280
different configurations lot of

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,169
different networking cards a different

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:59,559
sport and it all needs testing and it's

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,390
something that even the most peripheral

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,669
e involved user can come and help us out

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:07,170
with just give us that feedback we've

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,340
got a debug page there that shows

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,660
to give us exactly the feedback that we

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,280
need to fix the bug and usually kind of

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,630
bug fixed in half an hour or something

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,720
if i'm awake at that time so it's a few

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:22,820
things that help making being munity

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:27,390
member work spread the word pass it on

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:29,460
this a great audience here and but i'm

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,230
not speaking to the whole world and i

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,470
hope that you could go out and do that

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,650
for me when using something if it works

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,940
well tell us what works it's nice to

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,380
hear about it and it's good to know that

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,550
it's working for you because it might be

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,800
working for us and we don't know if it's

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,720
working for one else conversely

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,560
something's going wrong don't just get

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,090
used to it don't don't get hardened by

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,440
things going wrong and you think oh well

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,330
that's obvious it's going to get fixed

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,380
next release it may only be happening on

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,090
your desktop or it might be only

00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,410
happening on your motherboard but it may

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,000
not be the one that we've got women may

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,230
not know about it so so it's better to

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,690
report too much than too little and then

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,370
also as you got start reporting problems

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,290
learn how to how to work with the

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,150
developers how to actually give them the

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,740
information they need you'll find the

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,650
bugs get close much faster it's really

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:20,250
satisfying and for example i was i was

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,690
on linux weekly news last week and it

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,940
goes telling me hey there's this

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,880
shortcut from windows that I really

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,320
really missed in KDE 4 and it's alt and

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,110
tab is your standard window switcher and

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,650
then there's all turned escape which

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,200
sends the window to the back its kind of

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,760
going backwards through the windows and

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,110
he told me exactly what he was he gave

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,300
me a a reference to the Wikipedia

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:53,370
article and we got that fixed in days

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:55,020
and days in hours sorry and then while

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,770
you're doing it have fun while you drink

00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,110
don't feel that you have to do this

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,790
don't get so bogged into it that you you

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,310
put aside doing things that are fun

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,750
because it just you won't stick it do

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,880
when it's fun when it's not doing on

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,790
play space invaders I don't care do

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,110
whatever and here's a few things that

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,180
you can do is contribute we have a

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,400
mailing list active main list good

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,200
technical resource opensuse katie dog

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,230
and show you the link at the end come to

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,880

always a very friendly town hall type

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,220
atmosphere people can come raise the

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,940
problems have lots of lots of in-house

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:49,630
developers go to that test our packages

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,490
we have a lot of repositories we can

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,160
always get the freshest kd4 so we've got

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,860
4.1 stable where we're testing security

00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,690
releases 4.2 factory where the next

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,480
product is being released and we've no a

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,710
4.3 which is based to KD for trunk you

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:09,010
can really get the bleeding edge with

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:10,990
that come along mete this lens package

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,640
you put your the software if you're

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,960
writing even if writing a little plasma

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,820
up loiter applet deployed plasmoid or

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,020
applets you might be writing something

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,250
in JavaScript or a little bit of Pi thin

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,260
will show you how to package it get out

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,610
there you can put in a wrapper and you

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,440

vocals and get rid of a few like get a

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,260

welcome to syndicate their blog their

00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,080
translations your language we have

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,010
because we're doing custom work we've

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,809
got some stuff that isn't getting

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,490
translated upstream and we have a system

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:13,059
for getting those translations back into

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,549
opensuse if you're a specialist any of

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:20,320
these things educators writers hardware

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:22,240
freaks sis admins we need these interest

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,980
groups to get your specialist feedback

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,190
you can come become a Decatur donate

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:30,780
domain expert in this area and really

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,780
become a figure in the group

00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:38,480
and finally plea don't want to

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,280
contribute that's fine we're still on

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,200
your side where it got your interests

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,610
their best interests art we want to make

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,160
your experience with open Cesar as good

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,110
as possible we can't do everything for

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,370
you but we are very well-connected in

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,410
the open source communities we can go

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,840
out there and we can pass on your

00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,340
information make sure that your report

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,320
bug reports get better and better and go

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:02,630
out there and and reach the ears that

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,860
you need to reach to get things fixed so

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,500
these the concrete things that we're

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,360
working on the moment and 11.2 is coming

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,670
up and probably but six months or a

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,200
little bit longest time we've got to set

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,400
one to set our goals and priorities now

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,410
and that means we've got little have

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,060
things to work on so we need to really

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,320
pick on a few focus areas things that

00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,210
really important to it and we'd like to

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,620
know what what you think is important

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,000
and what your friends think is important

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,360
so come on to those meetings tell us

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,160
what's going on we want 11.2 we're going

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,890
to have Katie for as the KDE desktop

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,360
that you get from the installer and

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,150
which means that any regressions which

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:40,180
are left versus kd3 we need to know

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:42,320
about now so we can get them fixed and

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,970
as you said there's lots of ways we can

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,610
join us and help out and just take

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,380
responsibility for certain area so maybe

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,890
making sure that our amarok packages are

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,080
always really good and then if you're

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,640
kd3 guy and no one's ever going to take

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
katie three way from you it's open

00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,090
source software it's there for you to

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,770
use it's still in the report build

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,050
repositories you can take that and you

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,490
can make live CDs you kind of one click

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,440
installs you can make customized

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:12,260
opensuse only source kt3 we'd love to

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:15,170
have somebody who take over that okay so

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,270
that's all for me you can start your

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,810
participation now by telling me what

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:25,330
else needs change or any other questions

00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,330
that come to mind Mike

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:33,190
just give it a minute to warm up okay my

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,470
first degree was in psychology mm-hmm

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,850
and I'm going to give a physical example

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:43,359
first the United States Army made a jet

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:45,639
with the parachute on the seat and they

00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,299
kept getting people that parachuted out

00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:52,960
of the plane without a parachute and I

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:55,570
felt something must be wrong well the

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,049
engineers had perfectly placed an eject

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,200
button just past the point where they

00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:04,269
had to open their seat belt so they open

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,919
their seatbelt and they plus the eject

00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:09,039
button and of course they're out without

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,909
a parachute well physical things like

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,129
that are pretty obvious how stupid it is

00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:17,320
but I've given up trying I've written

00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:24,249
dozens of bug reports about

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:28,419
psychological factors and without fail I

00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:31,809
get back what works for me you know I

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:34,899
can do it and several other Linux gurus

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:37,210
get on and say yeah yeah it's all you

00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:39,460
know just right you know leave that

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,489
stupid idiot alone that you know works

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,039
with common people right so how do we

00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:47,320
get over that kind of problem it's

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,700
definitely a tough one just tell them

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,269
for a second don't you might want to say

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,639
something else and one way around that

00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:58,779
is that we've got the mount just point

00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:59,919
it away from me Thanks okay one thing

00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:03,190
we've got we've got a voting system

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,320
which means that if a bug is is really

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,940
showing up we'll see not just one bug

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,590
report will see a lot of votes on it and

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,629
we're not going to go closing foot bug

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,340
reports we've got four people or two

00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,690
people saying that solar problem then

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,399
we'll always take that seriously I don't

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,320
think that works very well because it's

00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,480
for the people that already know how to

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,129
use the software rather than the masses

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,279
of people that don't know how to use the

00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:26,080
software and I think the other thing is

00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,739
really to become an advocate within the

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,070
community and you've got cycle

00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:35,230
psychology training Europe communicator

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,359
then you can go out there and talk to

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,120
people get the other people's

00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,559
perspectives on this bug

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,370
book and then communicate it to us in

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:50,850
the way that it actually shows it to us

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:54,570
so make some connections it's it you

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:59,670
know as a psychiatrist people have very

00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,440
subjective views on software and there

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,670
it's very easy for developers to get

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,620
into a rut where they only use the

00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,300
software in one way and that's lethal

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,180
because you're in that rut you're never

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,280
actually going leaving that Rutten going

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,679
over the bumpy bits where which don't

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,540
get so much traffic but those may be

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,100
unknown to you and unknown to me cuz

00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,130
i've been using katie for like ten years

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:25,080
now the most frequently travel paths for

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:26,429
people and so it takes a little bit of

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,990
persistence sometimes look at a problem

00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,940
from a different angle and formulate the

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,590
problem in a way that will make us see

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,850
it but when we do see it if it's genuine

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:38,090
we won't throw it out anymore for

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,090
anymore

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,580
and in terms of when you do find a

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,010
problem and it's with a que te package

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,380
like oh where is the dividing line

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,300
between reporting it through the Susie

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:03,040
channels are going directly to KDE

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:05,620
channels it's it's it's not a firm line

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,340
it depends very much on the severity of

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,200
the book and whether but in the primary

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,570
thing is whether it's in suddenly we've

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,730
done so for example like do you know the

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,650
sysinfo iOS llave if you click on my

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,650
computer I mean we wrote that originally

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,060
it's now used everywhere else but we

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:26,020
want to hear what books left in there

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:28,090
first networkmanager the UK applet that

00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,230
I've just been writing stick it in the

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,920
Vale bugzilla rather see it straight

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,990
away and but on the other hand if it's a

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,410
severe bug we don't want to put us after

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,510
out then let everyone run into it so an

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:44,140
example of tough my head migration of

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:47,040
email distribution lists to from kt3 to

00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,150
katie for its broken by designing KD for

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,930
the guy he wrote it as a particular way

00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,850
of using or it doesn't show up but it's

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:57,220
it's not for the for the basic default

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,540
user is broken so i'm fixing that and

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,750
i'm putting out a migration tool which

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,370
will copy people stuff across okay so i

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,990
have a specific problem and if you

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,550
wanted me to take this offline fair

00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,930
enough but i find k mail in KDE 4

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,640
horrendously slow in comparison the KDE

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,440
three now i don't know if that's a

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,370
configuration if it's the way it was

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,620
compiled or it's a bug in the KDE code

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,490
so it for that particular problem i get

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,160
what i thought points that in terms of

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,780
came out sense I'm a tack on came Ella a

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,730
little bit I don't got some small packs

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,950
in there but I'm not the expert but I

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,560
will i do a very good communications

00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,720
with the kml 19 so something that's

00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,870
there i will probably close up stream

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,870
with a reference to the upstream book

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,390
and then pursue it upstream and

00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,470
integrate the changes in our packages if

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,080
you want to go up straight in straight

00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:53,310
away that's fine do that as well if you

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,310
go through me it might get a bit more

00:32:53,580 --> 00:33:06,950
um if I put my name on the CC saying yes

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:06,950
this is problem okay all right all right

00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,470
so even if you've got any specific other

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,639
specific problems that are bugging you

00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:23,809
with that on 4.1 or on 4.2 42 is that

00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:25,460
when your listing email headers when you

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,470
when you switch to a new folder it takes

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,330
a while for the emails to appear in the

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,679
header list just even downloading email

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:36,080
I've used distributed I map and I have

00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,999
ten or twelve thousand emails on my

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,409
system but I don't that I'm not

00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:42,470
downloading that many emails it can

00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:46,159
might only be 10 or 15 what kmail hangs

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,929
for seconds okay now haven't seen one

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,879
myself and know about header listing but

00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:55,480
yeah report it and we'll take it

00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:55,480
upstream Thomas all right

00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,610
mozilla it's risky but you as

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,309
NM state being incredibly slow in q4 or

00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:08,630
Katie okay I don't know how to say this

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,630
but is it no

00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,450
it's always the traffic people who are

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:32,740
big bad k mental problems and shout the

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:36,370
loudest about isn't it so yeah look us

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,990
up online or ram or search for the book

00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,640
yourself and CC yourself onto it and you

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,560
can stick my name on it and see it see

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,550
list as well and I'll make sure it goes

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,010
into opensuse where yeah not so rather

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,930
than 4.2 but we are doing a big 4.1

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:57,310
update with all the things that went

00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:58,810
into sled 4.1 for opensuse 11.1 well if

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,160
there's no other questions that I can

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,760
hug the microphone for another two

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,920
seconds all right guy kt e kitty 4.2

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:12,310
icu's released with a cutie 45 while our

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,890
does those rpms in a in a repository

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,590
released on yeah pulling pulling these

00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,330
things like so i presume once once

00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,890
packages right there like that that

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,180
effectively means you guys are happy

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,360
enough with it that it generally works

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,970
or like what how do we know what the

00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,220
status is of such a repository go online

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:35,860
and ask question if it's referred to

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:37,660
from the KD 4 page on the wiki then it

00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,270
says what degree of confidence we have

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:45,090
in it otherwise there's no guarantees

00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:48,280
for example we building 4.2 versus q45

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,560
mainly that is froze its QA verification

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,310
that q45 can actually build everything

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,560
and we have discovered significant

00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:00,040
problems that that say trail tech

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,440
weren't aware of using that but yet you

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,990
you if you are using the repositories

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,770
you should be on the mailing list on the

00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:10,600
opensuse KD mailing list at least and it

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:15,520
also doesn't hurt to make sure you read

00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,810
our blogs okay thanks a lot of people

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,430
burnt fingers from that repository

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,430
because they'll went we and

00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:30,820
I have a new feature request in fact I

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,920
have it since 2005 for something it's

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,530
like so this is gonna be nobody nobody

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,120
wants to do it so I just proposed it

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,760
everywhere I go and somebody asks for

00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,940
new features huh I use contact and I use

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,730
wiki's so I want the diary finally being

00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:49,660
able to choose to be used as a wiki

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:52,000
client where I can choose the syntax of

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,690
the wiki I know the synchronization of

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,700
that stuff is quite hard but ok let's

00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,040
forget about synchronization imagine I

00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:03,160
want just a straight blank page and i

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,970
want to write on it offline and being

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:11,740
able to open it and synchronize and

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,200
created on that so the diary on contact

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,250
doesn't make it pretty much any sense

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,460
well it will wants it you can look for

00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,770
that information but since it sticked on

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:28,900
the calendar once the days pass you lose

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:31,600
it so at least with wikis you can still

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,280
a sub is missing information which is

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,010
pretty much all data and you can share

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,860
it yeah it's a nice idea I think that'll

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,720
probably happen in the KT 4.3 time frame

00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,140
with with our canale because that means

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,550
you have that separation between the

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,140
content of your application and where

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,290
it's stored much more strongly than we

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:53,680
have now and I'm not aware of a wiki

00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,900
client specifically for KDE but we are

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,470
seeing a lot of growth in access

00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,810
libraries for online services so blog

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,960
things remember the milk so I could

00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,460
imagine that there might be the

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,320
components to make something like that

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:13,330
fairly soon good idea I did look into

00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,930
doing that myself for a little while ago

00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:19,870
but I'm one of the big trouble some

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:22,720
aspects of it is complicated syntax of

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:26,590
for example mediawiki supporting

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:30,090
templates would be very hard and not you

00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,090
know those kind of features

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,360
thanks dude okay well thanks for

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:42,820
everyone for coming if you've got any

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:50,110
more questions find me Oh question nope

00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:57,070
step up well i started using the boon to

00:38:50,110 --> 00:39:00,100
for one reason uh-huh it had 0704 and I

00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:05,650
could know when it was done uh-huh oh

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:08,800
nine ten I mean oh eight ten I know when

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:16,480
it was done I don't know why everybody

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:22,840
doesn't adopt just you know some little

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:28,200
thing oh nine and we all and in fact you

00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:32,380
don't even need this until 23 you know

00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,980
what everybody knows hexadecimal and so

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,920
the next year will be a and the year

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:43,180
after that will be be you know and you

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:52,000
can keep on going down to 20 35 with you

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:58,900
know 2035 will be Z and and you can do

00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,960
the month right after that December is

00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,780
going to be C and you can do the dates

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:09,810
all the way down to 31 which is going to

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:15,310
be V and then after that you can put 1.3

00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:19,050
or 0.8 or whatever you want to do will

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:21,250
the SS 10 because so many times I see

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,110
something on the internet about some

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,530
great package I look up and it's been

00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,900
dead for five years if I at least had

00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:32,050
something like this before it I wouldn't

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,730
even look up to see you know what the

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:38,170
current status is once I saw that it was

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,700
this

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:44,660
alright thanks that's an interesting

00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,060
suggestion the good thing about the

00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,650
build service is it gives you the chance

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,080
to take all those ready packaged

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,180
software in not even the a knowing RPM

00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,800
packaging and you could make a

00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,930
customized distribution which added to

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,500
say a suffix containing this information

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:05,200
give it a go it might be a winner yeah

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,200
