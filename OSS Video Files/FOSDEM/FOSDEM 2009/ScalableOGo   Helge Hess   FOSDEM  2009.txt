okay but i want to give a small

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,619
introduction to scalable over which was

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:25,580
a progressed server written an object

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:30,350
the scene and first of it well to mark

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,840
this is a larger project which as well

00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,870
more like a framework for for building

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,690
you can as service pretty much like most

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,019
Epis framework for building GUI

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,620
application so we are focusing on

00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:50,370
building reusable objects for living

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,170
such service because the requirements

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,470
for who preservers are pretty different

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,470
so there's not just one who pair

00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,220
celibate which fits on but you usually

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,549
want to have different kinds of Buddhism

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,549
we had a lot of code pretty large code

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,430
base for Caroline calendaring and

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,220
conflict management we have some a

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,680
simple document management from you have

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,320
a lot of protocol communications by

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,470
protocols I mean protocols which are

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,490
used between client applications my ass

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:30,210
SP tweeters or calendaring clients and

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,670
the service and we currently have two

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,130
implementations of repair service the

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,880
first one is open group here the regular

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,980
cat or become fan scoffs monitor or

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,220
smaller work rules and has a pretty

00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:48,300
complex functionality and the scalable

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:53,530
which was of the newer newer was I think

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:56,689
started in 2004 something up 2005

00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,200
it's a bit repression has a different

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:04,460
portals which I come through well again

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,399
as I said oh boob there was no trust for

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,190
building those two implementations what

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,920
we really want to bring forward progress

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,250
than just standards as well like for

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,010
example i cal down and group that and we

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,660
also do not want to reinvent the

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,680
software for example we are not pulling

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:28,160
any AP software on email servers stuff

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,220
like that because they are really great

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,769
projects which already exist for example

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,110
i was born amir serve as a career

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:40,010
foreign service doesn't really make any

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:43,640
sense to replace those the divisional

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,780
American the evacuation coming with

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,730
metal taxes integrated into the email

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,340
system usually so it's not where you

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:59,110
later to the movie apartment interests

00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:01,760
and education as I said beyond seven to

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,209
look at standards we want to connect

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,579
neighbor clients so we do not want to be

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:13,250
in that country our program and of

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:15,799
course you want to be jewelry soft and

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,920
so on we won't use any non-free software

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,300
and willing to implementation that's all

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,750
GPR Malecha p.m.

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,030
so to get back to scale over it's a bit

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,810
difficult to explain because especially

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,330
end users do not understand why they are

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,800
different by different approaches are

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,510
necessary for example red oval has a lot

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,600
of functionality and it's not really

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:48,290
slow but it's intended for few hundreds

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,910
of users at most so you can waste a lot

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,520
of cpu on of doing complex cover in

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,530
contrast a scalable system is designed

00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,270
for hundreds not thousands of users and

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,510
to do that you need to take a lot more

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,000
care about processing power and storage

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:12,200
to eat and stuff like that so we will

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,609
track the functionality again scale of

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:20,390
the server so what does scalable would

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:23,750
do it's really based on this then that

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,979
stuff so for email what we use imap 400

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,870
just reuse existing mail servers and

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:32,270
address book and calendar and the

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,690
charity grated our channel completely

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:38,090
based on I clement v card so this we

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,930
actually store the data and I Kalina and

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,720
we guard so there's no mismatch between

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,960
native clients or open source native

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,750
lines and the server and it is also very

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,470
simple for example in the kettle movie

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,370
you can have records which are really

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,350
interconnected for some of you had a

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:03,320
company contact you can assign those

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,210
company records are other employees and

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,970
stuff like that as a system maintains

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,370
connection between them but database

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,190
wise this is quite expensive because you

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,480
need to do the joint between the

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,640
different tables

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,550
that is not possible and scalable or

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,100
unscalable over and contact is always on

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,440
its own it's just the vcard but just got

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,900
in the server so it's very simple to

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,560
remove and very fast to eat weave into

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:35,930
store doesn't alarm those complex links

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,570
between them object never ever fed a

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,150
common problem in group fairness that a

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,370
group provides more functionality like

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,460
what sample open call them the latest

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,860
lines usually don't support level so

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,840
this is why many who get projects

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,340
provide web interfaces because they can

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,920
do anything they want in the end

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,890
interface but made of lines like

00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,150
evolution or context they are not easily

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,250
accessible so it's our to add a complex

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,310
functionality but they are the perfect

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,600
fit for scalable because it just is a

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,460
sustained thing about this through

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,820
either scale over was initially

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:21,320
developed for large regiments we look at

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,090
about sixty thousand users which we have

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,180
to be supplied using that Cooper

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,820
solution and they have had we baited

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,130
require requires the earth what was it

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,260
would need to be scalable because they

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,080
wanted to a hosted on a smoke last out

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,590
was seen as more class than Thor in a

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,120
central location so they didn't have I

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:47,090
wasn't there so husband just one they

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,710
wanted to support native Knights mozilla

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:54,340
native thanks sunbird and an Android was

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:58,040
in France they wanted to replace a

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:02,690
proprietary lines like outlook by using

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,910
open source wise and that they still

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,470
wanted to have a web interface but the

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,710
requirement was that the web interface

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,930
should look exactly like Thunderbird was

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,259
handle like the desktop application

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:18,550
and well scalable although most

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:23,960
developed to meet all those requirements

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:28,300
first Cal ability as I said then it's a

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,240
very complex topic but one thing as

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,430
usual regular database based who

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,389
perseveres like open group vendors and

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,660
open or equal ground here think about a

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:45,110
hundred more they usually have a single

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,020
tables database tables for coming events

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,570
table we are all the events as a dog and

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,030
all events also system of thought in

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,910
that single table and of course it's

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,580
fine if you have a million events or

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,210
something like that that's fine for a

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:06,590
sequel database but if you have 60,000

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,270
users with the chair maybe 10,000 events

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,669
each it doesn't scare you anymore

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:16,880
because you get tables which are huge

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:19,400
and so scalable over the song because as

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,310
a middle of a are scalable over can

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,150
distribute the data between different

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,130
tables and those tables can even live on

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,199
different servers so actually in the

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,380
french project we had a three pack and

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,060
service so you could assign user boots

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:41,000
to the servers and the data would be

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:43,310
scored on the front cluster machine then

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,459
as i mentioned to performs drawers why

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,620
then my new card so it just takes for

00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,500
example Sundberg right sandy went into

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,270
the server it just takes that i can

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,459
announce tours that as it gets even so

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,600
it's very fast operational just a singer

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:06,579
updated the database and to stop watch

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:11,690
the vet interface he also

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:13,940
extra index over that information that's

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,149
necessary because of York just saw the

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,569
Eiffel and a coyote in the database you

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:23,180
can't use SQL to have more queries in

00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,250
that and then so for example people to

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,810
show week of events would need to pass

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:33,759
each icon in a fire and but that's too

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,860
slow so we have a separate table which

00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:40,069
extracts the core information from these

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,420
fights like start time end time and it's

00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:46,430
brought in an additional database table

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,829
for fast queries in the web interface so

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:54,259
that web interface can say give me the

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:56,420
poison super offers me the next tables

00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,939
can also be split by campus that can be

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,300
multiple tables and they can even live

00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:05,290
on different database service than the

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,290
content tables which stores as a panel

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:13,130
so it's very interesting because the

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,930
content tables are bound me to be on a

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:20,449
very fast storage because for something

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,850
could be honest no great great one

00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:24,829
something like that which ensures

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,230
integrity because it's the important

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,360
information where's the index tables

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,130
they can be reconstructed from the

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,220
content so you can place them on

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,800
volatile storage like a solid status or

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,230
something if a brace you can just throw

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,149
it away entry will index from the

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:47,179
content tables that makes a lot of sense

00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:52,969
so it can be more aggressive

00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:55,919
optimization of the next table well

00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:57,959
there are a third item if you would

00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,099
don't you selected to face at all but a

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,319
Native Client they just between those

00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:07,799
pre-rendered I Clemence or weaker triads

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:09,629
so it's not like and alone where service

00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,119
at the Eiffel Nov trans not be

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,269
constructed into a database fields and

00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:17,549
it will reconstruct it to the icon in

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:21,779
the fire on retrieval you just bought an

00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:23,849
M as I can well we just need to pull

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:28,649
them out of the database and sent to the

00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:31,739
client which is very very fancy Native

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:34,439
Client oil approach was to push open

00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:36,629
standards so actually we started out

00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:39,509
with group death which is not really a

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:45,299
standard but more like a convention be a

00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:47,729
town for the KDE developers and 2400 in

00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,859
the meantime there we have Calvin

00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,649
purchase amount official standard it's

00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:54,629
something I've seen for something and

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,459
allow the exact county button so

00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,619
rewritten expanded and it slightly

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,199
deployed it is gaining a lot of momentum

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:04,829
for example Google and Yahoo also

00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:07,470
suffered a helmet now cut up as in the

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:10,319
works it's also going to be 0 Nigella

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,509
iced tea so we are very close and

00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:15,649
finally having we're stem and explore

00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:21,049
for whooping and draw standards also

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:24,629
supported by a scalable over actually we

00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:27,239
extend some clients the open-source

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,149
clients which is very bad do not support

00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:32,759
standards very well unfortunately so as

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,919
a caliph implementations it was a lot

00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,289
for example do not provide all the

00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,389
necessary features as a headless for

00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:42,569
cannot do contact and stuff like that if

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:45,179
that was what the right I think in the

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,130
regular I don't know however we have

00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,650
plugins for us

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,330
clients which we get some missing

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,550
functionality for example the epic art

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,450
that address book for is a member for

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:02,070
the clan number address book and they

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:06,070
are also extensions for the Caliph

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,770
connect on Mozilla so it's actually the

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:12,640
primary client for scalable works really

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:15,190
well then you have a cannonball plugin

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,980
which is prob also javaserver just used

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,460
to synchronize all by devices like a

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,650
plan mobile phones and we have a plugin

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,960
which slightly connect the database

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,510
because the database go cycling let me

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:35,020
cut files you can just push that into

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:38,410
the funnel well because the support

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,360
those Dennard a especially in color not

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,950
force me you can use that icon for

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,080
setting the sir well you can even use a

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,630
regular better flying to cross the

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,720
collections and stuff like that just

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,850
looks quite nice well so that interface

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,130
as I said it was a requirement that they

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,710
wanted well the better the face that

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,740
looks exactly like the native clients

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:07,270
now the native son bird isn't very

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,130
beautiful actually quite ugly well the

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,770
latter the face looks exactly like that

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,260
so people ask us why I ended up at the

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:18,760
facebook so hardly stressed because it

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:24,250
was alone it looks ugly it's also very

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:28,030
scalable because we do a lot of a HDD so

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,970
that shows inside that interface issue

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:34,480
is actually a very scalable pudding

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:38,980
court as a lot of features to support a

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,770
double tier one of the ETA Z takes test

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:45,280
whether web page changed in the meantime

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,890
qui sont of the browser gets an HTML

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,000
page you can send a small token with

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,720
that witch

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,200
represents a state of that page scienter

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,470
if the plaza tries to we get the same

00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,960
page ition just checks whether the token

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,030
change but it didn't change you can pull

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,090
it from its local cache or in-memory

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:11,200
cache so it's very fast the same is true

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,510
for proxies you can between the actual

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,750
application server and the browser you

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,400
can put a proxy like security or there

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,850
are no proxies are patching also as a

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,400
proxy module in that which can catch the

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,430
information for multiple users for

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,330
examples are Rosa connects us as a proxy

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,400
server and the proxy server ask ask the

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,760
application just once and if another

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,310
user retweets the same information it's

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,680
already already in the proxy so it

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:47,350
doesn't even need to be bothered with my

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,140
people users and the the thing this is

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,090
working better females because emails in

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,060
an eye on so that can't be changed as

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,100
always the same if you will change in

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,910
here a lineup server you would it would

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,010
get assigned a new ID so if you have an

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,070
idea that i know i'm at servers that it

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,920
never changes sort of what is thought in

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,320
there so actually a firm and emails read

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,480
not by the web interface HTML page of

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,460
that email which should shows that email

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,520
that can be cashed by the browser

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,400
locally so i think we tweaked at once

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,790
and so user looks at set the same email

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,200
a second time it's already in profit so

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:32,230
it's really nice

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:38,560
well some password stuff so yellow oval

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:44,650
as rest is basically another word for

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:48,370
HTTP my opinion because well this dial

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,460
out right HTTP services and Alvaro

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:55,260
galanis implementing or blue toronto's

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,570
let the photo pods that she was the

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,090
standard HTTP verbs put to get the lead

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,390
to read and write cycle and now and we

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:10,089
got plans so if for example cool tools

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:13,990
Cesar I kadena the web browser you can

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:17,709
just enter the URL to the icon file and

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,410
instead of adding a lot HTML you at a

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,510
dot ICS and then you get the I to

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:26,050
another presentation directly quote

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:31,720
multiples the database pretty nice and

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:34,270
well even for email you can even the web

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,370
interface is built around a letter s

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,460
prime supports or that event that

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:44,020
hierarchy so you can actually use a

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,050
scalable over as an IMF HTTP gateway for

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,140
example if you have the user it could be

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,720
the local name and the imap server you

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,650
can traverse the I much a polar I repeat

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,950
to get to the email id like

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,530
we know if you'll retweet that using an

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,050
HTTP library or web browser or whatever

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,620
you want to do and you actually get some

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:11,070
mind the mind which represents that

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,140
email that has been better because the

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,440
eyelid service do not authorize the

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,410
facility to extract specific parts on

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,560
such a mind map for example if you get a

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:26,730
multi partner which contains a text text

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:29,520
and an image you can actually address

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,200
the image using a code for example there

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,990
could be the image with which is

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,300
embedded in the mine structure and what

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,150
work is done by a dinosaur and she saw

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:43,350
it's just the Gateway there's also our

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:46,260
the weapon density shows images if you

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:50,790
will bring us HTML page representing

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,820
that email something like 14 feet dot

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,430
HTML and then HTML page actually

00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,210
reference a part from the annex early so

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,460
it's really comes pretty interesting I

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,380
think it's pretty interesting for a lot

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,950
of different projects as well just that

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,130
gateway because it makes it very easy to

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:14,220
develop email life is much easier to

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:17,860
work with HD even the final dish can be

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:21,790
quite and quite comprehensive

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,299
so we are re actually we are very close

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,400
to a wonderful week 1 dot all released

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,100
coming at nine was freeze last week

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,460
actually it's a production at really

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:36,340
large customer site so then I think

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,070
Canada the guys wish to the main

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,470
development which is in Reverse they

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:48,070
have about three customers each with

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:52,240
about 40,000 units so it's like anyways

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,940
a final release will come soon the

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,100
development at this time is mostly done

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,740
by a company called worse which is in

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,140
Canada and they only to open source

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:07,570
stuff so it's not it will not sell

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,890
anything not a licensed business or

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,500
something like that they are basically a

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,740
hosting company for a large ministries

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,720
and education facilities in their care

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,730
and well you can get the code at

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,640
monotone repository from dingoes therapy

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,790
or from subversion every time they're so

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,429
leave my asking mine they pushed the

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,710
state to the subversion server so that

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:37,179
we have the properties is to reenter the

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,700
central server so actually the

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:42,280
development was going very well we don't

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,150
let much much help on the core server

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,640
but what we would like to see as more

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,309
suffer for more native clients and that

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,790
something i said before the situation

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:58,480
and open source clients and open

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:01,750
standards is very bad so you would

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,260
really talk to an evolution contact

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,330
developers for improving that because

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,330
God we are mostly doing more than

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,610
helping with it was the last bus order

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:15,840
this is a primary client but we would

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:22,980
really love to get some people on

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:29,100
being in contact with subtle then well

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:31,440
that portal turns an object is written

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,140
in objective-c totes rear compile code

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,559
and you get a real demon out of that mud

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:41,669
some virtual machine biology only to run

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:47,640
and something which takes can gigabytes

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:50,460
of memory and certain so badly

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,399
objective-c is something may not know

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,200
it's really a part of GCC as bother you

00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:58,320
compile back you get a regular binary

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,890
out of that God is very classic

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,679
optimized as long as boring like Jamaa

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:09,450
and its password compliant thanks to the

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,190
iphone because the iphone i think brings

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,620
a lot of developers to object a seat

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,980
because all software on that is we're

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:21,960
now in objective-c and so it's quite

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:24,240
rare and I've try to bring up a diagram

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,070
of how it all fits together it's

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,270
basically the object to see one time

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,980
which is coming the circle compiler then

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,710
we have Sigma state-based by word which

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,330
is useless here for all go and move

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,149
their first order reason to use a

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:42,539
different foundation I agree that most

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:46,020
foundation ivory contain stuff like two

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:48,960
twin Henley on net tables and all the

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,140
basic stuff then we have said so p

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,080
application server this is doing a lot

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,179
of things it's basically but as the name

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,929
say that says it's an education summit

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,850
does all the HTML rendering but it also

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,370
contains all the libraries which are

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,100
used by it scalable google and totally

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:11,520
fair for example generating icon in the

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,490
price of pausing them drawing eek

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,220
viewers an HTML all the segments and

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,419
other stuff in soapy and its i would say

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,509
it about seventeen percent of sales

00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:28,220
or maybe even or because I me was such a

00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:30,679
lot of shared code so well on top we

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,259
have the two applications the one which

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:46,700
is more complex and the one which is

00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:49,460
very light light and fast yeah oh you

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,679
can reach us well across using the

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,399
website and scalable overworked or open

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,330
book fair park and mailing is for scale

00:23:55,399 --> 00:24:01,899
the almost solo at Google power and it's

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:06,730
open to everyone everyone can subscribe

00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:11,840
well join us on command stop us testing

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:14,090
whatever first opponent questions what

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,359
this does is a packaging of the soap

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,369
very much and we are component of the

00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,279
scalable on booty but they are my cell

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:24,950
free there we go in studying yeah that

00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,519
book server and the for the compliance

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,289
between a libraries of the soup

00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:35,359
framework and all the upper compliant

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:37,519
was a mess with didn't step in didn't an

00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,009
actual there provided employment

00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,090
actually I know that they provide a very

00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:46,059
young pekka transformed from a record

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:49,520
but I don't mobile data

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:53,630
it is something I a purple manages their

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,790
packaging for our hands and that's

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,710
typically maintained by a millimeter

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:01,010
using the same technotrekker for their

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:08,660
customer informants or it's supposed to

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:11,510
work actually it's not that easy to put

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,799
on source code because scalable although

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:17,360
pictures of you things of soft peak

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:24,260
mostly because we use those different

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:28,490
foundations I discuss the role of our

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,580
nation is it beautifully or what by

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:35,120
moving it's clearly the better line we

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,559
because I worked on it but about the

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,169
foundation that hasn't really developed

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,309
any further test sites I mean it's table

00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:46,850
does what it does and we do not put a

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:49,510
lot of work into that reported over 2 mu

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,510
sub base but I think maybe this weekend

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,130
Sebastian is very active them in that

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:59,179
American convince with childhood if you

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:02,540
have global now he's on the scalable not

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:04,700
anymore on the other but Robin scalable

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,549
always use is already using most epic

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,799
like around said let me get back to now

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,440
know that there was an electrically

00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,000
active you basically would like to

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,280
replace this was the cancer it by read

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,210
the major advantage for prepare would be

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,370
that goose mfrs better unique or 10 so

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,750
on the foundation only really does is

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:32,179
11-1 so all look at which was straight

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,970
at the foreign languages

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:39,399
for example and check and check or co

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:42,440
london se8 evading advantage I mean

00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:46,549
stability wise it's done now nor made a

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,220
buxom that so it just works but I think

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:52,190
you move to participation what time was

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:56,269
that mostly depends on but people who

00:26:52,190 --> 00:27:00,190
work on my motivation was pretty long

00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:07,549
including that because it works for me

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:09,740
our like least a parent community how I

00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:13,369
don't know Nestle mailing us I don't

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,279
know most of most of the workers my

00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,309
experience with Professor versus what we

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,919
book and scalable all is that a lot of

00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:25,580
people are not interested in doing that

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,610
so it's usually a small circle of

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,460
developers which are also I think

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,789
businesses in that a domain is not like

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,679
there's some student which likes career

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:39,259
services because of the business

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,499
application vertically and it's very

00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:47,179
hard to give a brutal community around

00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:49,159
that but I think we about 10 to 20 guys

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,630
or something like that which I actively

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:56,710
involved

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:58,750
to address of the current status can

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,090
then ultimately with three complaints

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,720
it's hundred-person confirm the Potala

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:07,000
wave count I can scare the over doesn't

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,550
implement all of calif in fact i think

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,430
knows to irvine can support all of

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:16,270
health because it's quite complex moscow

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:18,480
prayer service actually implements a

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:23,050
subset you're just required to post

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,840
Ethel icon so that's we get more than

00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:29,140
three different frequencies supported

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,540
actually so that's also an add-on for

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,580
most it up beyond was the last extended

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,820
for free busy functionality and others

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:41,920
are scalable mobile so it's not too bad

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:44,010
but my opinion is that a portion rather

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,200
you scoop that because it's much simpler

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:50,020
and you can actually implement

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,670
implementable and cut office can be

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,400
pretty complex and causing me to

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,770
implement position resentment as a whole

00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,740
bunch of stuff which has connected to

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:03,690
that but I'm doing color talking Momo so

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,690
I can come tomorrow

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:21,130
because my observer the recent an

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:24,260
airline that get any time with EMP no

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:29,539
actually we are not using a lot of that

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:31,760
and scalable over because the GTR that's

00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:34,990
an object mapping framework for those

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,660
who don't know it where can met database

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,240
records to object and that's to snow

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,240
forward we are doing the exact scale so

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,850
we are only using the adapter they never

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,970
so it's like jvc or something like that

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:53,450
but so that's what people's in scalable

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,980
over so it's not no mapping stuff we

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,730
don't really need any features of

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:02,000
Chianti I was thinking it back in

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,679
because actually they are oracle

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,070
adapters for that which i could be

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,260
maintained there's pasta school yet I

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,690
think we have a lot in one that doesn't

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,419
appear one of soapy than Angie here too

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:17,990
I brought a simple like one the mines

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:23,059
dilemma what else we have thus I this

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:28,940
one I think pretty much my database on

00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:32,860
the front page it is actually I'm is so

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:36,169
bad timer yes its axis is actually a

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,559
multiple libraries so they're real damn

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:43,130
reusable code and the GL library is also

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:47,030
imagine one lightly as part of soapy but

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:49,789
us technically is at GES that lose that

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,559
database likely we just imported a

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,270
previous version into the soapy

00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,539
application server which was working for

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,700
us and clue service continuing the

00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,720
development of seduce the database

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,270
memory

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,700
separately from that so we built like

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:08,730
the foundation situation we have a

00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,470
pretty stable here one library and here

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:15,500
a lot of connectors and stuff like that

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:18,960
very well attested and could possibly

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,730
probably changed to Gillian to open it

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,670
doesn't buy us a lot at this moment

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,620
because the stuff which is new and two

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,990
year too it's not interesting class

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,600
because it's on a higher level modeling

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,679
stuff which was which we do not use we

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,020
need to go pretty much down to the

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,960
database tool together necessary speak

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,140
having their some something's year one

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:53,010
were stood away from the original

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:55,050
version what we mostly notifications as

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,380
actually a qualified to be our bond

00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:01,200
which we did some stuff adjustment makes

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,470
it fast or more reliable for example all

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,110
version doesn't doesn't throw exceptions

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,210
do more exceptions but returned just

00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,429
caught the error codes or closet

00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:20,370
exceptions and object to see are always

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:24,510
walk other division I don't trust them

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:30,540
yes Sarah plan to make education against

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:34,590
cameras the open where the rain was

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,140
there very very much I know that who has

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:41,160
also had some deployments which actually

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:44,420
use active directory as a Sadie API

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:48,450
service and i think but i no knockers

00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,790
exported about that upon ever knew who

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,809
are inside development this is going on

00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:56,809
are now and coalition's well for example

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,720
Sebastian is working on the news that

00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:03,630
very spot but functional device well

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,160
there's a lot happening more than

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,920
birthday today there will be hit a

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,320
certain group queries I mean three years

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,700
later than they acted in an oven and

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,820
they are enabled now by users I was

00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,460
mostly a matter of time because the

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:25,380
people i know a final letter to face but

00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,390
a plan well basic plan for me was using

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,950
the scalable over interface and

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,860
something which is called a spy store

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:35,610
solon open-roof am so psyched or server

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:38,580
does the iphone in and because stuff for

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:41,309
open book bag so it maps things to

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,740
eiffel enemy crack and it's pretty

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:46,500
similar to what is a scalable over user

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:50,010
defector so it could possibly really use

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,020
as integration I wouldn't like to have

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,940
some time trying this category for the

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,990
open cooper one interracial the

00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:03,240
iCalendar IndyCar do what you promised

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:06,410
only can be actually I am also doing the

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,410
charm of project

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,720
so I actually implemented this is the

00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,470
worst back from the fair coconut engine

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,690
so there's actually in OVO je maar but

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:21,359
whether it's only there's a customized

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,280
susan head for one specific client but

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,649
its users exactly the same database and

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,010
it's also a modern user interface with a

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:32,339
sweet i'll enter the information system

00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,909
for diplomacy chamber so they are pretty

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:39,260
specific requirement but maybe a dozen

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:42,089
balls into it or people found employment

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,659
yes integration with proprietary

00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:50,369
something is allowed this equation are

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:53,310
open Koopman handbook but a lot of

00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,349
stockist lgpl I mean if I'm I broke my

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,030
damn my first question for the next

00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:00,480
question is can i make some question

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:03,980
about proprietary regulation can ask for

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,079
when I outlook is integrated in there or

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,810
but actually I'm working for company

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,410
which lesson I'll and you won't

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,480
come it's just we used to have an output

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:18,030
plugin for just hope you finish was

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,300
using an old quater college and torches

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:24,599
open professor and we are just in the

00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,670
last three years we are even retargeting

00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,740
that offer clapping to use colored and

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,829
cut it so you can actually use that

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:34,800
plugin with any so that which supports

00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:36,839
caught up in coming here so that's in

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,510
the works and can ejaculate you're going

00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,430
to seeing called a kind of mobile phones

00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,490
and I'd like that because was not

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,859
compatible you are my points you could

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:49,740
use panel born the scalable in-depth I

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:52,260
am we are gone okay but we can you could

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,869
actually can be a crime the so-called

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,450
crime restore our box so you can replace

00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,369
your peacekeeper that store and then you

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,510
can use equalised already once astral

00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:03,430
plane

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,650
so it's much better because I remember

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:10,150
that the sink was going you have to

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:11,800
store as basically the one which is your

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,600
primary one of the client and the

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,090
secondary one which is given by decline

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,740
like you care you know but was not

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,830
thinking because was finding the first

00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:23,020
one yeah it's mostly a problem of

00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:27,420
awkward cause of work I can only say the

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:30,610
so called a deep chord Callinan okay and

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,760
to replace a PSD file you need to

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,800
support primary storage wine and see

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,540
what could be one it is not

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,770
complex in more than you I but only one

00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,290
can be our only one but we worked

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,830
completely actually use a sicko light as

00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:51,040
a database and you can take it as a

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:53,050
replacement for 65 I had the resin which

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,750
we used up in Gruber to subdue

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,540
completely change by that look yeah well

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,490
a lot of a lot of them up the current

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,100
 which we had about developing and

00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:06,010
coming to email yet so you would still

00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,900
have to guess the primary storage does

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,500
the calendar and said let's box and then

00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:16,390
you have the imac connector from and so

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:19,240
it's one additional community they keep

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,310
buying the completed nearly never said

00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,930
it's not different at all perkins a

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,630
general case the people set an

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:28,030
opportunist i know you still also get to

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,930
hear the API Valkyrie an exchange the

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,930
money need to get really

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:56,720
okay more questions why are you working

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:59,300
with Auburn missiles I was expecting but

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,850
because i'm also doing the work in java

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:07,730
i can assure you it's much more awesome

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:13,869
for an object to see I I know what I'm

00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:13,869
