Description: 
	By Robert Lazzurs and Jasper Capel

During this talk, we aim to give you an overview of the Cobbler project, explain where we'd like to see it going and explain a few use cases.

Cobbler is an installation server, written in Python, which allows for rapid deployment (and re-deployment) of large amounts of physical and virtual machines by defining distributions, repositories, profiles and systems as objects. It's easy to get started with Cobbler, but we ship a lot of advanced features to make it as versatile as possible, so you won't get bored with it.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
