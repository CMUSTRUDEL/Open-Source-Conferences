doing is absolutely elegant it can't be

00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:05,189
true that software is free and that's

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:08,610
why we do this one just to tell you we

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,789
are doing free software and yes we want

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,710
to tell children about it we want the

00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:19,619
children uses free software and

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:25,009
something somebody told me it's good to

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,009

package or science 2007 and I'm proud to

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,530
join the education project last year I

00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:15,430
started as a normal packager but later

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,709
thanks to Lars I I became the one of the

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,769
four administrators right now i maintain

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:25,959
several packages in our repository I

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:28,599
lost the counts really and my job is a

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,019
the technology teacher in a QSI

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:35,440
international school that is a school to

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:39,269
the International where sons of United

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,220
Nation employees go on on several states

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:46,780
he is large swagat and he can talk ok

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,470
welcome my name is Las I'm

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,920
formerly known as last rope and my

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,620
nickname is kleiner i spare it's a

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,670
special name for the Germans under US

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,680
and currently I'm working for the altar

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,609
build or distribution team for a Sousa

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,750
and joined the education team around two

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:13,120
thousand six before I worked on a

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,600
special product called Susan school

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,799
server and therefore I have some

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,450
knowledge about the education thing i'm

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,410
currently maintaining around 250

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,980
packages in the education repository and

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,680
as you might see that's far too much and

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,170
i hope i can give away some of those

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:42,210
packages to the upstream developers in

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:48,930
the near future ok we so

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:56,700
that's our goals the main goal is Paris

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:59,880
do you teach tomorrow we first goal and

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,220
currently the main goal is to get up and

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,750
zoos and schools and to support those

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,620
schools using opensuse and help them to

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,240
get it spread around our pupils of

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,240
course we want to provide the best

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,670
integration between opensuse and our

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,060
application for both server and desktop

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:25,500
why that's why for us clients are

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,590
important like servers because without

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,930
them we can't provide a good environment

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,840
in schools you know lots of schools were

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,470
using Active Directory and we think that

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,170
we can completely substitute active

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,350
directory with opens with an education

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:46,740
that's why we provide both will also try

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,120
to contribute to improve opensuse that's

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:55,050
why large told that will hopefully we

00:04:51,120 --> 00:05:00,810
can send upstream our packages well else

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:04,560
you can see here to two goals of green

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,680
and off blue the debt goals are still a

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,930
kind of working progress in fact we will

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,360
try to build across distribution

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,140
education community but is not really

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,570
easy right now the same work is a the

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,140
same thing is to work together with the

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,320
developers even if when we have some

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:30,020
examples like salami developers and took

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,780
spint once and lots of others what else

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,350
last last point support home users means

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,990
if anybody of you has a kid perhaps you

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,080
might know what's the critical aspects

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:47,130
letting kids working alone on your pc

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,120
and that's one other task we have one is

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,550
to work for schools and get educational

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,920
applications in schools another one is

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,890
to help home users with

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,250
kids so they can even use the same

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,800
applications it's really simple or even

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,270
get something like a filter software for

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,850
Firefox and so on what does we have

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,180
right now we have a very very big

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,880
project and is growing day by day we

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:23,810
have something like 800 packages for

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:27,810
both x32 and 7 24 bits we release it the

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:31,710
one dot zero at dawn for opensuse 10 dot

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,840
2 10 dot 3 11 dot 0 and 11 dot 1 and

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,400
also for seasoning of center prices that

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,330
are forces in Linux Enterprise stand

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,180
sorry we provide on our wiki description

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,670
for not all the software right now but

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,630
we are working to do that for lots of

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,190
them anyway we have our bugzilla and we

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,640
have to say thanks to end well for

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,460
providing us that we have an SF land

00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,690
repository a developer wiki and our own

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:04,170
page you can see some URL on the bottom

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,150
of the page and we are also maybe the

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,430
most important things to repositories

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:15,000
the development one and the frozen one

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:17,640
there are two why simply because one is

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,610
intended for end user the other one of

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,910
course not let's see why the build

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,330
services repository I we wrote as

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:30,390
developer one is not for end user we

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,950
can't add a license dialogue we can

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,770
write everything on that license

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:38,700
dialogue but we can't add into the build

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:41,550
service repository known as features we

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,740
cannot control files we can't add

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,610
package translations and everything else

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,220
we tried to ezel all education software

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,280
using the standard control file provided

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,770
by the opensuse DVD and simply doesn't

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,430
fit so using the build server repository

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,580
we can't work with it is not available

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,610
without an Internet watches because it's

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:09,569
you know a single package sometimes

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,089
trigger several packages to build

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:16,969
so you need the internet access to

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:20,550
download anytime the latest package look

00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:22,379
to enhance the the third point it's not

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,969
available without internet access means

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:31,499
at least if you have schools with 50 60

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:33,990
100 pcs you don't want each PC to

00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:36,690
connect directly to the Internet to get

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,259
all the packages that's one point why we

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,099
release and add on ISO image so people

00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:47,519
can just burn it on the DVD and use this

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:52,019
DVD instead of connecting each PC to the

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:56,970
Internet okay next point zipper ad

00:08:52,019 --> 00:09:01,139
repository is non refresh well here it's

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:04,709
simple just use the command line tool

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:08,420
zipper and at the opensuse build service

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:12,540
education repository will notice that

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:16,170
separates this repository with a marking

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,810
non refresh so what can happen you try

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,230
to install one package one or two hours

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,500
later and in this time the build servers

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,939
rebuilds the whole repository the

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:34,829
package super has on the cash is version

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:36,860
10 and release 35 no the build service

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:40,259
has rebuild with a complete repository

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,100
sipper has the cast repository and says

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:47,939
hey I wat release 35 but the build

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,980
service has 36 and that's when super

00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:54,720
tells you sorry this package is not

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,389
available refresh means now Lord at

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,189
least the metadata if even if you have

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,930
an internet connection to refresh all

00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:03,990
the time we have to download at least

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,660
four megas so is a waste of time is a

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,500
waste of Internet bandwidth and

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,509
everything no end user information why

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,060
packages as an aggravation or release

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:18,990
number this is maybe one of the most

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,730
important points in fact on using a

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,010
build service repository we can't

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:29,040
provide information

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:32,400
before so before install a package ok

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,350
you can have informational only after

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,870
you excelled at reading the package

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:40,530
changelog that is not a good thing you

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:43,940
know you want to know what we change we

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,940
made before install a new version

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,540
packages can be broken during testing

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,180
you know that's a develop a development

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,600
repository we up reach age we ugly

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:59,010
patched and sometimes packages are

00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,110
broken and even if a test is any always

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,960
welcome and end-user don't care about

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:08,100
broken repository otherwise it wants

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:12,570
only stables one but wait so nope one

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,510
second please okay that's our reasons

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,720
for using the build servers for

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,710
developers and for testers that's our

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,270
reasons at the moment why we can't use

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:29,460
the build service for end-users and

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,550
hopefully in the next future of the

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,780
build service releases all these topics

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:40,650
will be gone but until then we stay with

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:43,320
this seven points to tell people if you

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:47,040
want stable packages if you want

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:54,750
packages that just work please use of

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:58,790
frozen repositories so this is a short

00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:05,040
overview how we work at the moment I

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:08,280
have this one so on this side you see

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,610
what we as developers do it's just

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,880
simply the same process every developer

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:17,340
knows we get the sources put them in the

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,160
build service the build service builds

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,820
the package hopefully and afterwards we

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,980
can test the package we have additional

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,180
testers around the world testing

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,090
packages from the build service

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,620
repository and add back seller entries

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,780
to our bugzilla

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,630
afterwards we can just restart the

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,820
process fixing the packages rebuilding

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,480
them testing then again and so on and so

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:47,570
on so at the moment once a time when we

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,860
decide that we are in a stable enough

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:55,190
state we say okay now it's a time to

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,950
create a frozen repository ready to use

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,540
for end users that's when we begin to

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:06,590
sink the build service repository

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:10,450
outside we start just putting down the

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:14,810
packages on a separate server and

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,080
reassign them with our own gpg key to

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,610
make it clear that this package has

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,300
nothing to do with original build

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:27,500
service it just has another gpg key it

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,270
has another signing if you test such a

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,940
package in the frozen repository will

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,280
notice that these packages are already

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,260
signed with the gpg key from the

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,770
opensuse education team and not with a

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,350
build service one another one is

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,980
building this repository enables us to

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,930
use all the just features so if you add

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,580
this repository you get a license

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,980
dialogue it tells you how you can reach

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,770
us how we can talk to us how you can add

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,230
axilla entries and so on if you enable

00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,470
this repository you have patterned files

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,140
which means a group of packages which

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,470
are useful for small kids for bigger

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:11,330
kids for really universities and so on

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:14,630
and even for servers and that's why we

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:17,270
use this step to sync the packages

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:24,520
outside of the build servers repository

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:27,260
and well I was a cold beep happens and

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:31,580
sometimes always packages in this frozen

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:35,390
repository are broken well the same is

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:39,890
for every distribution I think and for

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:41,930
this case we have also a frozen let's

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,620
call it frozen it's just outside of the

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,490
build service update repository so if we

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,930
detect

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,330
the broken package in this frozen

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:56,690
repository we are already have enabled

00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:00,950
and installed an update repository in

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:04,190
your zipper if you install the frozen

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,620
repository and look at several you will

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,950
get an additional update repository

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,339
which is para fold disabled because if

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,190
you have a school with 60 or more pcs

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:18,500
you don't want even to search for

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,600
updates in this repository that's the

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,720
reason why it is able to parry fold but

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,670
if you enable it you can get updates for

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,540
these packages in the frozen repository

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,450
and these updates are coming for example

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,640
with patch infos so you can see before

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:39,950
you install a package what has changed

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:43,550
and of course we don't have to forget

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:47,750
our community in fact using mailing list

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,570
ears and the weak and the bugzilla wiki

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,020
request we can have all the information

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,660
we need to provide new packages to fix

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,180
the bugs we can find and everything

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:02,329
works with our bugzilla everything would

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:06,410
be moving there without it our work is

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:11,360
very very difficult so our community is

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:15,800
maybe the the core of our work of our

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,860
team without it we can't work oh we're

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,740
we've talking unless work forums and so

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,800
on all your possibilities where you can

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,860
talk to people outside talk to the

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,200
community and often the community tells

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,540
us hey I want this package or this

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,829
package could be better package or so on

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:39,320
and to not get lost this information we

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:42,260
currently just use bugzilla so we have

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,570
for example and on wish list in our box

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,769
allah so people can just add new package

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:52,860
wishes

00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:57,139
going on okay but we talk about their

00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,059
about that yet but we can review again I

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:04,439
saw we have updates and frozen

00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:06,779
repository but what are benefits using a

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,020
frozen repository you don't need to

00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:13,380
refresh it is frozen we follow the same

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,779
policy as open to the repository we have

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,000
a frozen one and an updated one the

00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,089
first one is not only to be refreshing

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,659
is well tested and the state and

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,939
packages are stable is food we have one

00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:30,600
gpg key that can fully control

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,179
everything and is an add-on media we can

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,320
we provide an iso and weak and

00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:40,260
everything starts automatically it is

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,200
easy and easier to document we in fact

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:49,380
usually provide a documentation about

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,870
the most important packages in stay with

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,179
the repository and the ISO image and

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,399
it's easier to fight back reports

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,270
because you know exactly which version

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:03,120
which release of a package is buggy

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:05,399
using the bug the open sensible service

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,120
repository you know the package is build

00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:11,480
any time and maybe you file a bug report

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,450
that has been fixed on the next release

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:19,470
using the update repository is that yes

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:23,070
is a added automatically and is not

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:26,850
refreshed is not set as how to refresh

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:30,360
you have to enable it but most important

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:34,350
things as as we told before is it

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,690
contains patch infos you see in the open

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,820
source updater applet what kind of

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,950
change has been made on the package if

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,409
you agree with that change you can

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:48,049
install the package it is something you

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:51,029
can compare before the installation and

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,039
its really smaller than the main

00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:58,350
repository is Jack we saw the metadata

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,600
and was just 100 50 kilobits so dense is

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:05,240
more megabit

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:08,270
a whole repository okay we have to say

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,929
thanks to lots of people starting from

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:15,140
opensuse novell my linux user Brook with

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:18,770
a group the Linux debris look sorry XTS

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:21,799
tooks for my tux for kids and did ask is

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,440
a tally on group that provide that

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,830
provide opens to the air so sorry open

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:32,659
source a CDL and all the others which

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:35,240
have no logo of course i can like like

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:40,360
like communities and our developers and

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:44,659
so on but if you can see at this slide

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,280
what we want to do is to try to work

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:50,110
together with upstream work together

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,929
with other partners to get opensuse

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:57,700
education spirit around the world yep

00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:01,039
that's why HP and noel started an

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:06,890
education project and last week maybe

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:10,010
they they fire in use telling the tanks

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:12,980
to us for our work day and noble looks

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,530
like looks like that would two work

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,320
together with us to improve our packages

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:24,440
and provide any time I best and better

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,120
add on media for education just just for

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,690
the information currently we have around

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,690
20 packages alone in the education bill

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,950
service repository which does not mean

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:40,159
that these are all we have many more

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,530
people around the world yeah starting

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,309
testing by testing they are helping us

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:48,830
or helping people with their packages so

00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:51,740
if you look at the forums and such for

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,480
education you find many many requests

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,820
about packages for the application

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,409
repository and already people in the

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,039
forums helping each other to get this

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:03,710
running and even upstream developers are

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,770
now starting to work with us so if

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,600
upstream says hey it's a good tool we

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,179
can start something for example we have

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,510
already packages for fedora and some

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,600
people already asked

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:19,290
to build also their packages software

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,660
for debian and ubuntu the only reason

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,640
currently that we doesn't have such

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,620
packages for debian and ubuntu is that

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,140
we are not Debian packages at the moment

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,480
and we just have to learn it so if

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,900
somebody who is able to package deb

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:40,290
deb's link it ok join us great great

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:42,300
journey yeah okay Kiwi ltsp is maybe the

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:47,190
most important server project we are

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:50,600
working on and it's been awarded in 2008

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:55,560
of free open source software in India

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:58,890
well what's Kiwi ltsp well Q ltsp is

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:03,570
based on linux terminal server project

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:07,020
called LTS b5 it provides simply a way

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:10,640
to use from the from T clients that

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,890
means clients without an art risk and

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:19,230
without an R disk application from the

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:21,480
main computer lots of terminal server or

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,450
and many thin clients that many teen

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,530
clients means also very obsolete

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:31,950
computers in schools supports pixie

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:34,230
support they are able to pixie boots

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,520
they can boot from the inter from the

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:42,000
internet net well we use also Kiwi to

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,730
build our system pigs client we create

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,660
an image of the world operating system

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:52,800
and a benefit using the Kiwi is that

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:55,110
Kiwi is widely used is a stable resource

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,140
right now is use it with the suitable

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:01,170
sorry is used on to the studio on bill

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,750
service is integrated into yours is the

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,930
easy to our local application and going

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:12,960
on I would ask you well test ltsp works

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:15,690
simply install the it use ltsp to send a

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,600
single image but the single image is not

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,780
a single application is the image is the

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,630
image of the world operating system so

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,639
thin clients computers without an our

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,399
disk

00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:30,799
re obsolete computers are able to start

00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:32,779
the wall operating system with all

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,570
application installed on the main

00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:40,669
computer right now with the computer

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:44,089
with 4g gas or ram right we are able to

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,489
boot something like Terry thin clients

00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:53,049
or something like that so you know with

00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:57,649
a very good pc you can create a nice

00:23:53,049 --> 00:24:00,409
computer lab in your school with just

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:04,459
few money just just by reusing old

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,940
hardware which obsolete normally and

00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:12,820
doesn't run the current applications and

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:17,539
I forget to tell that Q ltsp is not

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:22,279
limited to a pxe boot you can also

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:25,219
thanks to Kiwi both using live CDs USB

00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:28,639
mages and everything else you have in

00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:32,450
your mind we also provide an integration

00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:38,389
with the talc and with ice cream to

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:41,809
provide a kind of build farm one I mean

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:45,229
that's that's one reason why we use TV

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:48,469
it's really easy at the moment even if

00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:51,859
there is no GUI for it but you just have

00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:54,349
to edit some configuration files restart

00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:58,279
the build and for example if you can

00:24:54,349 --> 00:25:00,829
have an old hardware you have for

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,499
example a pentium 3 or something like

00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:06,679
that and you said okay running this as

00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:10,759
normal thin client without really using

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,309
the processor is not really useful for

00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:17,229
me because then everything runs on the

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,570
terminal server so we can try to find a

00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:23,089
way to way solution just saying

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,599
something like okay I integrate a

00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:28,549
Firefox in the key view image it's just

00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,919
by adding the package name to the

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,320
configuration fire rebuild the image and

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,319
now you have a Firefox running on your

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,239
local client if you start it from there

00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,440
so the terminal server doesn't have to

00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:42,620
run Firefox

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,110
all the clients run Firefox and so you

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,230
can test how much your hardware works

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,279
and you can find the best solution for

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,889
your setup by just adding packages which

00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,409
can be run locally for example I don't

00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,929
think you want to have OpenOffice run on

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:03,799
your local client but other apps maybe

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:08,889
are useful for that and we are we have

00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:14,360
also cyborg and other developers that

00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:18,529
builded a kind of gooey 4ql TSP called

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,429
easy ltsp is an easy configurator that

00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:25,399
allow you to set up just few things and

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:28,370
press ok stop everything is working but

00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:30,379
I'll Canyon is the Q ltsp well the

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,110
easiest way is to use their one-click

00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:37,029
install or maybe use our patterns

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:40,580
provided on our frozen repository and

00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:43,399
that's all install the packages start

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:47,179
easy ltsp and you have to configure at

00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:51,200
least the server IP address and a DHCP

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:54,259
range that are the minimum requirements

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,899
for ever ql TSP working you can of

00:26:54,259 --> 00:27:01,519
course also other packages you want to

00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:03,950
resell you can customize your your

00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,559
configuration but that's the simple

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:10,639
things you need to work on so you did it

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:14,240
just press on ok easy ltsp will start

00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:18,139
the setup process will start the tftp

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,730
server that dhcp server and nothing else

00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,980
you simply have to boot your thin

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,240
clients from network maybe or using your

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,269
cds or USB sticks and whoa you have now

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,480
your tea clients working opensuse with

00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:36,590
the educational software of course

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:44,540
yeah so I think this is the time where

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:50,530
everyone can ask questions ya know okay

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:55,850
so yes I'm going to close here sir I

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:58,460
know I'm I'm 0rg country yeah it's often

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,010
in education and you so you're talking a

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,830
lot of infrastructure that you build to

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:07,100
deliver open seas and you didn't talk a

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:10,580
lot about the content itself so where

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,620
are we in terms of content as a teacher

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,070
of the school can already find

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:19,580
everything they need in the open cheese

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:22,820
or in the free software community or do

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:28,940
we still have some bigger miss in the

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:33,799
application stack yes by the time were

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:36,410
cameroon yes question about applications

00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,679
that are there or that are missing it's

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,290
not easy to answer because we have a so

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,350
told you already over 800 packages g

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,450
accompli is one of the things physically

00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:52,610
or the other applications for small kids

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:55,970
are also there so if you like to compare

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:58,130
the opensuse release and other reasons

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,490
like fedora or debian we are currently

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,470
at the same stage so this is not the

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,380
problem the problem is that we need

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,900
feedback from schools from the users

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,230
that's the really reason that we have

00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:16,340
because we can package thousands of

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:19,730
packages if nobody uses is or better

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:25,190
nobody tells us which packages are

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:29,660
useful it's not worth the work not at

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:34,640
least so for us it's really nice to see

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:38,360
as HP starts and tells us hey here are

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,200
40 applications we need those 40

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,770
applications that's when I start to ask

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,830
why and HP tells us yeah

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,110
we have a marketing and marketing tells

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:55,310
us that people want these 40

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:58,970
applications that's why we want to work

00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:01,880
together with other parties because if

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,420
you can get more information about what

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,970
people outside need outside our

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:11,990
developer brain let's say it so we can

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,090
just easily work for them and if i told

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,800
you in the beginning that we are trying

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:21,950
to work for home users every time i talk

00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:26,600
to people having kids at home they say

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:28,940
hey yes my kid want to get a pc but i'm

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,750
not sure if the internet is the right

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,630
thing for my kid and that's where we

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:39,050
should start thinking about why is this

00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:42,020
so and how can we solve this and so in

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,570
this process it's very important for us

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:48,350
to get the feedback out of the community

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:53,360
out of our users and start adding cells

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:56,270
feature wishes to our bugzilla to don't

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,190
get them lost so it's really important

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:03,020
hopefully this is answering your

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:05,300
question or so yes there are plans

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,580
already for the next version we are

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,180
currently releasing open to the

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:14,810
education 10 which for us means at least

00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,910
we have all the packages that we think

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,490
that are worth to have in our repository

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,800
the next version will be at least one

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,810
dot one or something like this having

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,790
additional packages and the first

00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,580
applications developed especially for

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:31,520
schools and for home users so for

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,700
example that the Kiwi ltsp is is one of

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,610
those as we talk to teachers that he'll

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:40,940
associate terminal servers wow great

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:44,380
wonderful but can you it's really

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:47,840
difficult to set up and maintain it so

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,900
we are going closer and said okay how

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,060
can we reach us to make it easily to be

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,420
installed by people not having the

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,260
technology background so they just

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,480
should

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,610
at least take these three steps and

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,970
everything is up and running so I'm

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,910
really appreciate that the fedora

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:12,120
success providing an USB stick where you

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:15,720
can say okay put it in boot it and your

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,670
terminal server is ready well okay

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,220
that's the next step opensuse will

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:25,110
follow but yes with with such simply

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,560
simpler system means it's it's really

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,690
easy to reach the people outside and

00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,870
show them that it's really easy to use

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:37,020
and that the packages that we have are

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,060
also useful for them with the problems

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,380
that people have tons of applications

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:45,960
but no description and don't know least

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,320
talk with teachers if the time hey it's

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,600
wonderful application you can get your

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,930
vocabularies learned automatically

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,110
within result at the end the 38 and

00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:00,300
where's the documentation in my language

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,210
and that's the main problem that we and

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:11,250
I think every other project has at the

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:13,500
moment my company does a lot of internal

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,080
training so it's not only for schools i

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,750
would say and I'm an application

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,810
engineer sometimes we do training on

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,210
Linux so we get the live CD and we can't

00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,190
store any of the results so that would

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,070
be one of the key benefits of having a

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:31,440
live site did live CD that could

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,750
directly connect to server where you

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,330
could generate automatically a home

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,550
directory so you could retrieve data

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,220
that would be a big benefit I would say

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,290
if you had that type of function okay

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:48,180
thank you that's one of the features for

00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:50,670
a box allah and it's not easy not really

00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,160
complicated to implement because we have

00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,920
already such life easels you can put in

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,200
there booting via peaks ii and don't

00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,370
touch your hard disk so what we have to

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,610
do is integrate that into the domain

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:08,659
okay we also forget to say that we

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,980
provided some some month ago the first

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:14,399
education life CD

00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,580
build it using me Suzy studio and allow

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:23,810
you to try opensuse education without

00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,810
installing no stuff's on on your pcs so

00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,770
what you also could consider it's all

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,050
since they're restoring internal server

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,690
is that you built from the live CD and

00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,629
then you have a USB key as your harddisk

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:50,639
yet that would also make life a lot

00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:54,899
easier sure oh just okay i think debian

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,930
has a popularity contest which when you

00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,609
sign and you say okay you know

00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,890
afterwards they even will collect how

00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:05,060
many programs and which programs you

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,920
used I think something could give you

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,410
automatic feedback from your users just

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,080
put it into the one-click install and

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,650
add okay you may send it and you get

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:20,550
information yeah one such as the other

00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:25,830
one is a mmm from old pc switzerland do

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:28,890
you package also sugar on it but they're

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,350
complete Noah development repository we

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:35,090
don't say they are ready for use okay

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,090
but you are working on it and there is

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:50,810
yeah I have a question about your

00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:57,260
development model when you when you are

00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:59,810
seeing your I mean do you froze the the

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,990
build service rapist and give the same

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:05,270
thing we have in the frozen repositories

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:08,390
so if you if I look for an application

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:11,869
on your build service I it would be the

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:15,230
same version as in the frozen yeah kind

00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:20,710
of a kind of we when we reach the froze

00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:23,780
the frozen state we disable building on

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:27,020
building and sometimes also updating on

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:30,230
the build service repository then we go

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,630
to download everything real packages all

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:36,770
that one we consider stable enough and

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:40,010
then with a simple bash script that last

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:42,290
wrote we are able to resign everything

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,420
they are simple the same package coming

00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,940
from the build service for reason of

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:51,350
camp for compatibility reasons sorry

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:54,710
because it must be built using the open

00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,690
source software repository and stuffs

00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,940
like that we simply download and

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:02,780
resigning adding on the frozen

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:06,109
repository then we go to recreate the

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:10,250
world repository structure using tool to

00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:15,770
write like create repo and repositories

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:20,800
is ready for use right but yes I should

00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:20,800
be the servicer is a really big back yes

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,920
do you have a you talking about open

00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,600
school server where I don't know exactly

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,720
what it is that's a straight with a

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:38,350
school tool the sister that made ubuntu

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:41,540
to administrate a school laboratory or

00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,460
horses could infrastructure and how

00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,550
could we work with the application

00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:51,000
because many school don't use a not have

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:55,050
a login / user some add some don't have

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,550
and they want any way to get was a

00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,150
neighbor interested to have feedback

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:03,030
from the application to the user to save

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,310
the data into the user directory even if

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,200
there is no no login because I don't

00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,210
want to there are a lot of questions

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,600
around this I don't know if you have

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:16,980
some ideas or investigated or how can we

00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:20,340
work in this area well currently we are

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:25,020
working on yes model that should be able

00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:30,090
to manage rights on clients on on

00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:33,930
students and teachers pcs and using Kiwi

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:36,630
ltsp you are also able to create one

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,390
single user and allow login for

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,670
everybody or also if your school is

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:46,170
integrated into an active directory

00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:48,720
domain if you install an SSH class

00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,290
server on your Windows Server you are

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:58,320
also able to login in queue ltsp using

00:38:52,290 --> 00:39:01,790
Active Directory accounts so one thing I

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:06,360
have in mind thinking about storing

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:09,060
results of tests and so on for users is

00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,480
something we already evaluated with the

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:17,970
school server we have two options at all

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:20,760
one option is to use the ldap so what we

00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:25,080
have to do is patching each application

00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,830
to allow using ldap and to tell the

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:31,080
developers how to patch so it works

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:35,730
another option is to use a generic

00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:38,460
database back-end and that's something

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:42,300
the KDE developers already working on it

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,640
with the KDE new applications but it's

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,370
in a very very early state there are

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,970
currently just talking about the API and

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:53,460
so on so it's not really that kind of

00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,220
stuff that you can we can say outside

00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,730
users they can use it but there are

00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:03,240
discussions about this already but not a

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,530
real solution and I just want to wait

00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,710
until we have

00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:12,180
one or two solutions which can work

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,900
before we start a more generic

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,200
discussion with our people to get these

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,930
things working for all applications

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:30,360
hopefully but it's it's in the

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:35,910
discussion yes do you think that this is

00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:38,310
usable for remote education you have a

00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:44,180
server in Stockholm and you're running

00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:47,940
your training here yeah yes absolutely

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,950
but depending on your bandwidth that's

00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,190
that's the reason we have already in

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:56,550
Germany Germany schools have normally a

00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:59,340
free internet account but this account

00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:02,130
is very very limited in bandwidth so

00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:05,070
schools can download nearly everything

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:08,190
but if people sitting at home and trying

00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:10,050
to reach the school server they're

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:14,610
sitting there and saying hey my modem is

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:17,310
faster so at least I think theoretically

00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,830
it should be possible and I know already

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,620
schools are working like this I know at

00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,790
least one school in Germany heaven 10

00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,540
megabyte or something like that

00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:31,130
bandwidth and teachers working at home

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:35,100
just connecting via web dev to the home

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:38,180
directories on the school server so yes

00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:41,690
even that's possible but it's a

00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,690
multipoint decision

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,970
depends on your uses this is it's not

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,490
really a unique to say okay you need at

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,630
least this bandwidth depending if you

00:41:53,490 --> 00:42:01,830
want to start with video editing or

00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:03,630
audio editing don't try this but for the

00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,390
normal user trying to work with open

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,780
office or something like that it's

00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:11,550
really a small bandwidth it works but

00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,470
transferring the whole application or

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,980
transfer making the next connection like

00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:19,260
something like this it's sometimes kind

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:24,120
of funny but free and eggs and so on

00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:27,800
already works so I if neither question I

00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:31,650
think we can okay can we have one kiss

00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,450
so our time is a just a single one a

00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,750
couple of years ago in tradition of

00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,600
educational software you mentioned that

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,820
the software and education part was

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,190
written with the Spanish language and

00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:49,070
english language how easy is it at this

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:53,480
day to translate it you other languages

00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:55,890
what with wrong let's develop a question

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,210
we're working on a web front-end to

00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,360
translate at least the package

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:03,290
description and so on but translating

00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,790
the packages the applications it's

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:09,540
hopefully something we can do together

00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:13,200
with upstream so every distribution the

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,600
benefit of it okay so if you have

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,080
further questions please contact us at

00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:22,910
the booth we will be there at least

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,910
until we go to sleep fix

00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:26,910
