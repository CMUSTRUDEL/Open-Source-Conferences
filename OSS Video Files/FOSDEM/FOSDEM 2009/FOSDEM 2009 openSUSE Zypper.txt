are we ready okay so hi and welcome my

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:28,580
name is young kupit I am member of Suzie

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,640
esteem and I mostly work on software

00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,310
management on software management

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,460
library lip zip and the command line

00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:43,940
tool zipper zipper is what I will be

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:46,309
talking about now and the talk will

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,870
consist of a quick overview overview of

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:54,379
all consumers commands of well before

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:58,780
that I I would like to ask you how many

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:03,920
of you didn't use zipper at all so far

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:07,670
okay not many okay thanks so a quick

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,600
overview at the start most of the talk I

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:15,050
will dedicate to give you some tips and

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,740
tricks that you may find useful then

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:22,009
maybe you don't know about them yet and

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,320
I will conclude wait list of some most

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:28,130
interesting future plans that we plan to

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,360
do in the time frame of 11 that to

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:35,390
release of opensuse so let's start with

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,090
the features first pot is zipper for

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,110
those who don't know it it's a

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,149
command-line software manager of I like

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,469
taking screenshots of command line

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,680
software survived made this beautiful

00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:54,110
one for you it's showing zipper

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:57,860
searching for key word eclipse it is a

00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,829
interface to lib zips the software

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,149
management library which does all the

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,509
package manage all the software

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,670
management stuff and zipper is just the

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,580
command line into interface to it but

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:16,190
nevertheless it is several thousands of

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:18,860
lines long so even the interface is

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,500
quite a lot of work a few words about

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,010
history zebra is two and a half years

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,490
years old it started in august two

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,640
thousand six when Duncan like we got

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,720
started to write his own command line

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,520
tool to test the lipsy bribery a few

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,530
weeks later Martin Widner took the code

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,330
and named the project zipper and a few

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,310
months later at the end of two thousand

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,800
six so zipper was first released in and

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,550
opensuse tended to distribution current

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,430
stable release is in opensuse 11 that

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,000
one and it's version one that's zero and

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:08,280
development releases are versioned one

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,400
dot one so to the features we can

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,420
categorize zippers commands into several

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,070
categories most obviously when you when

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,830
you are managing software on your system

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,290
you want to manipulate repulses of the

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,239
repositories you want to query for

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,880
package information you want to install

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:33,090
obviously you want to manage updates and

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,220
several special tasks so when managing

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,480
repositories you want to be able to add

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:43,530
them of course you can edit the text

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,110
configuration files in etcc repos d but

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,720
which way the command line tool is just

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,799
more convenient you can add them remove

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,220
them list them modify them refresh which

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,860
means download downloading package made

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,620
naked metadata from the repositories and

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:05,940
compiling them into internal cash for

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,840
quick access these service stuff i will

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,890
mention later so i'll just keep it now

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,019
queering you can search for for packages

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,950
by their names descriptions summaries

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,410
and so on you can print detailed info

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,530
about packages patterns patches and so

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,580
on you can list all patterns or packages

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,979
or patches that are available available

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,480
you can query for dependency information

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:40,900
in fact this is the only comment now but

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,520
I'll I'll tell about future plans the

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,550
main thing you want to do is install

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,560
there is an install command about this

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:52,510
install new recommends command i'll tell

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,680
later you want to manage updates we have

00:04:52,510 --> 00:05:01,570
three approaches to to update software

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,930
with on opensuse the first one listing

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,210
updates and updating is packaged wise

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,940
where you just take new versions of

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,240
packages that are installed and if they

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,170
are installable then then you just

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:24,100
install them the new versions another

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:28,660
approach is batchwise this this is a

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:32,290
specialty mostly opensuse maintenance

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,330
update are delivered dispatches of you

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,540
have to have a special special

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,930
repository providing patches in order to

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,960
use this feature and distribution

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,690
upgrade is a special update algorithm

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,680
that can handle split packages or

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:54,010
obsolete packages and stuff like that

00:05:49,680 --> 00:06:01,090
you usually use it to switch to newer

00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:03,760
newer release stable release then you

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,690
can protect packages to avoid changes

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,960
like don't list install specific package

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,850
don't remove specific package don't

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:22,350
upgrade it and so on for example you can

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:25,810
avoid updating kernel for example and

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,450
then some special commands most of it

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,080
most interesting of these is this verify

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,820
command this will check the integrity of

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,710
dependencies of your installed packages

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,800
and if there are some broken

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,650
dependencies it proposes to install

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,120
packages in order to satisfy them

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:48,550
a zipper has quite nice help system if

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,850
you just type zipper it will list all

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,389
the global options and commands that is

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,650
available to it and if you type zipper

00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:01,780
help and specific command you will get a

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,810
specific command description and all the

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,750
common specific options that is that are

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:12,490
available for the command also the man

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:15,610
on page is quite extensive to the

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:18,490
general features I will talk in detail

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,680
later about them just to listen just to

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,710
name them now zipper has known

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,810
interactive mode xml output it can work

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,810
on an alternative route directory and

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:35,050
this feature is actually shared of with

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,360
just as well because it's it's a little

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,099
feature not the feature but it's quite

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,919
interesting so I wanted to mention it

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:47,530
now the zipper can work with many medium

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:51,520
types I'll more details later so now to

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:54,039
the phone the basic things that you can

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,289
you want to do with zipper is install

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,080
software well the most obvious wave is

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:01,840
to type zipper install and the name of a

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,580
package if you don't care about which

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,120
version it will install from which a

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:10,599
repository and so on but these are some

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:14,139
special cases one of my favorite is that

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:19,840
you can install a plane out p.m. file

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:22,419
with zipper either local or remote or on

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,990
any media type that the trip support

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:30,490
later on that you can also install

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,729
specific version most of software

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,560
managers can do that I just want to I

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,020
just wanted to show you how to do it and

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:45,700
zipper you can install specific

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:47,860
architecture as well if if you for

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,740
example are compiling some source code

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,310
and it is complaining about some missing

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,290
library you can try issuing comment like

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,560
this

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,920
if the package metadata contains provide

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:07,050
symbols with for example it girl shared

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:10,230
object if you are lucky you can you can

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:16,470
get installed you can get this library

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,779
installed just with this command one of

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:23,930
the nice things are software pattern

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:27,660
buttons you can install for example a

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,389
lamp server which we just want with just

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,810
this command use first you can search

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,819
for patents just give the type option to

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,880
the search command it will list all the

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:40,920
patterns available and then you can

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,500
install with with the same time option

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,829
and the name of the pattern the same for

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:51,230
products and patches and packages as

00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,230
well but package is the default here

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,139
this is one of my other favorite

00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:00,480
features whole zipper you can install

00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,230
source packages and their bill

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,829
dependencies this is very handy for

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,720
developers just search for search button

00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:12,690
for for source packages in your

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,040
repository like like with the patent

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:20,010
case and if the repository contains of

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,290
source packages it will list them and

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,180
you use the package name in the source

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,180
in style command in will install the

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,130
source package and all of its bill

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,000
dependencies which are not installed yet

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,680
you can also there is also option to

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,170
install only the bill dependencies or

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:43,230
only the source package this install new

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,100
recommends command is a special feature

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:51,449
of lips at solo the lips SAT solver of

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:56,040
the underlying solver and it's it is

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:58,920
handy for installing for example

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,170
hardware drivers or language packages

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,430
for install and for already installed

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,010
packages for example if you plug in a

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,300
web camera there is a good chance that

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,779
this command

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,980
we'll install the needed driver for the

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,320
camera or if you have a graphics card

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:25,040
and you add a repository can providing

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:32,940
the driver for the graphics card it will

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:35,790
propose to install this driver ok now

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,190
for managing repository zipper has quite

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:43,290
a lot of options to make this convenient

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:45,450
for you for example you can modify

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,209
several reports it once with these

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,570
aggregate options or remote there you

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:55,829
can modified repositories of specific

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,640
media type and so on for example this

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:06,589
command terms of automatic refresh for

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,589
all repositories this command turns on

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,829
cashing of RPM packages for all remote

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:20,270
repositories like HTTP FTP Samba and so

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:22,740
on you can backup and restore

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,140
repositories you can export all your

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,649
repos from the system with this command

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,230
option on to the ripples command and

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,959
then you can restore them with a triple

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,120
and given the repo file as argument or

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:41,820
you can restore them on your new

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:44,730
computer and so on with each command you

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,880
can use temporary additional repository

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:51,149
without having to add the repo

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:58,829
permanently to your system just give the

00:12:51,149 --> 00:13:02,190
plus repo and repo URL then many

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:06,449
commands of for many comments there is

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:09,149
this repo auction available which makes

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,339
it only load the specified repositories

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,529
and work with them for example to do a

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,560
distribution upgrade with only main

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:19,560
opensuse repository and for example

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,470
Backman Backman repository you can

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,050
specify these two repositories just like

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,380
this

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,380
and perform at the distribution upgrade

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,990
this this one is handy if you don't have

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,850
internet connection and you have many

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,250
repositories without the Refresh turned

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:43,690
off in that case zipper would check will

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,060
check the repository if it's up to date

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,790
it would need connection for that you

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:54,600
can use this command to avoid that about

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:57,370
zipper connecting at all can be handy I

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:02,910
should mention repository priorities

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:06,310
here actually I screwed that up a bit

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:09,970
lips lip supports them but zipper ignore

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,730
stand now I'll be fixing it for for the

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,130
next release but it's a very handy thing

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,339
you can assign priorities to

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,709
repositories and be for example the

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,769
install command if you install specific

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:25,899
package and even if there exists better

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:30,070
version in a repository which has lower

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:32,079
priority it will take the the the older

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:37,390
version from the repository from with

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:40,240
the high priority this can be handy if

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,459
you if you have several Reapers

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
providing the same packages and you

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,500
trust one of the reports more for

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:55,360
example for having more stable packages

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:57,399
and so on one of the nice things of

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,360
zipper is that you can use it use it

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,970
from from from scripts and front ends

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,370
there are several things enabling this

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,089
for example begin on interactive mode in

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,790
which you can specify this global option

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,790
to any command and in that mode zipper

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:20,230
won't ask for in for confirmation or for

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:24,120
any user input on standard input and it

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:29,769
will it will use default answers of

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:32,020
automatically this option can be useful

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,029
if you if you are working for example

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,100
with your own repositories and you want

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,529
to avoid questions so

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,290
or prompts like whether you want to

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:47,639
import new repository key to the

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,639
database and RPM file checks and so on

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,540
then they are for their positive levels

00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:02,310
quiet is obviously the one which you

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:08,230
want to use when scripting normal is of

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:11,380
44 common use out of out of scrapes and

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:15,370
front ends and purposes for debugging

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,250
debugging obviously then there is xml

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,410
output for general put like normal

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,800
messages error messages warnings and so

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,069
on and also for prompt and some special

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:33,420
output all of these you can use in

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:33,420
marios for example graphical front ends

00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:46,149
you can tell z / to use alternative root

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:50,049
directory this can be handy for creating

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:55,029
a change route environment or for

00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:58,869
building your own appliance actually TV

00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:02,949
at least was using it of in order to do

00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:11,769
this I'm not sure if it's still that yes

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:16,299
product creator as well it can be handy

00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:19,360
for example also too if if you specify

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,000
an empty root directory and tell zipper

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,669
to install some package of first you

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,699
have to add a repository there and then

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,769
you tell installs tell zipper to install

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,679
some package you will like you will

00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:34,990
immediately see what other packages does

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:39,100
that package depend on and how many

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:42,490
machs megabytes it will add to that root

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:48,820
directory when installed and how many it

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:54,010
will need to retrieve well to the media

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:58,720
types of here are some examples for

00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:04,450
example you can use an ISO image of for

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:10,080
example Susa CD like as a software

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:16,419
repository the same for samba share the

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:20,409
most obviously HTTP FTP ripples also NFS

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:26,830
shares and many others here are more

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:31,659
examples of for example you can plug in

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:35,470
your USB hard drive and tell zipper to

00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:38,549
install an RPM package from it just like

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:43,860
this you have to specify the device

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,860
under which it is known to the system

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,309
all these URLs in the in this shape you

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:59,130
can use also mean yest it's a lipstick

00:18:53,309 --> 00:19:05,279
feature okay what we have here a similar

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:07,909
thing like like I mentioned in with the

00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:12,690
root directory you can do with this a

00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:16,169
global option this will avoid loading

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:20,340
the installed packages to the into the

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:23,549
memory so zipper will act as if no

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,940
packages were installed in on the system

00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:29,070
and if you tell tell it to install

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,760
zipper you will immediately see what

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:35,490
kind of packages that sleeper depend on

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:43,200
nitin this can be useful for developers

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:45,779
for packages mostly okay this this is a

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,929
workaround for a feature that it isn't

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:52,740
in lip zip yet but it we are working on

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,779
it many people request that we should be

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,169
able to first download all the packages

00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,590
and then install them at once you can do

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:09,120
it actually with this work round you

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:11,490
turn on cashing of RPM files then you do

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,350
a command for example install update or

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:18,270
dist-upgrade or any other that installs

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,820
packages with the dry run options this

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:27,000
passes the test option to the RPM

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:30,450
command and by these the older needed

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,929
packages get downloaded but not

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,230
installed only test it and then you do

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:40,440
the actual install so they first get

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:44,970
downloaded and then then you get in you

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:48,240
get them installed for for real it's

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:50,940
just a workaround and currently it is

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,700
being worked on the real support for

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,530
this

00:20:52,700 --> 00:21:02,720
now for the services this is actually a

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:06,380
new thing and it is not used widely as

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,780
yet but I just want to tell you what is

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:13,430
it all about so that you can probably

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:16,310
pick it up and provide services the idea

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:19,370
is to to provide the list of

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:25,990
repositories relevant for your

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:30,800
architecture for your target system on

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:35,720
under one URL you add this URL as

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:40,100
service and you get a list of services

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:49,490
as a response which zipper uses to add

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:53,480
or remove repositories and bile by doing

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,120
this you can leave the the task of

00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,260
maintaining the open the relevant

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,780
repositories on on this on the service

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,740
provider you just do refresh services

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:09,500
and it removes obsolete repositories it

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,730
will add new repositories then you just

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:16,580
choose several of them enable them with

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:21,530
modify repo command and then you just

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,570
use it like usual repositories more

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,240
information here you don't need to write

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,710
it down the slides will be available on

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:35,030
the first inside I guess all so that's

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:39,380
it for the tricks and now a few words

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:42,260
about future plans first we will be

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,840
working to improve the current

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,900
installation summary to include things

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,450
like version changes are changes vendor

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,050
changes the least recommended such a

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:57,490
state packages apart from from the

00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:02,300
others from the hard required packages

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:05,750
of we would like to include the viewing

00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:08,690
of change locks when updating packages

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:13,070
and maybe also dependence in three of

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,590
the packages being installed then we

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,110
will introduce a configuration file for

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,790
zipper there is many things special

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,250
spaces specific for zipper that can be

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:31,850
that would be good if it were

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:33,830
configurable then this this option will

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,890
be available everywhere we're currently

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,590
repo option is used and it will

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,230
basically select packages from the

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,560
repository you specified not it wont to

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:52,910
disable the others so it can satisfy

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:56,180
dependencies from the others we will

00:23:52,910 --> 00:24:02,720
completely remake the info command to be

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:07,070
more useful I mentioned what provides we

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,940
recommend of the plan is to add more

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:13,310
dependency querying commands well these

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,470
are similar to those that are available

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:23,870
in rpm command-line tool but a pattern

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:26,450
or what's different is that this command

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:32,140
will query also repositories not only

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:35,290
installed packages like rpn does well

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,630
then there will be some output polishing

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,850
most most wanted feature the overall

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:45,740
installation progress with estimated

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:51,740
time and these are the most important

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:56,390
ones the ideas the number of ideas is

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:59,390
quite a huge so we won't get angry if if

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,780
you take some of the ideas or bugs that

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,840
are open and fix them and send them send

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,840
us a patch you can get all the

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,210
information needed how to contact us

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,330
what are the mating mailing list for our

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,740
iron but what is our IRC channel and so

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:23,850
on on this wiki page on open

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:29,370
to say ork so we'll be glad if you join

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:35,520
us and here are some links jeepers home

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:39,030
page my blog where i will post some

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,220
interesting stuff about zipper and this

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:45,240
is the git repository where we well

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:51,390
we're where we host our project so
