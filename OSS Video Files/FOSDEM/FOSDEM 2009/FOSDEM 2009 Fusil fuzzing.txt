The talk will present how a fuzzer is written and how it works. Then we will analyze a crash. And finally we will see how to report it to the vendor and typical vendor reactions.

Fusil the fuzzer is a Python library to write fuzzers and a collection of twenty specific fuzzers: ClamAV, Firefox, mplayer, poppler (PDF), etc. A simple fuzzer can crash most (all?) applications.
