welcome everybody I want to introduce

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,920
myself first my name is lots of huts PLO

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:26,680
and I'm the develop our that is more

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:31,090
company member and used to use the

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:34,239
object and not cursive actually pipes

00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,559
stuff is very similar so I'm explained

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:44,379
with multiple decks mr. application

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:49,989
database application using all the TB

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:53,679
mugler and projects Allah first I want

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:58,440
to show you a small database application

00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,440
I hacked together and in this before

00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:09,030
it's called available manager and i

00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:09,030
already prepared it usually you would

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,740
open it by double-clicking on the app

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,200
folder but we are on patrol there's no

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:23,890
native support floor who's definitely i

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,990
have to go to the binary turn and i'm

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,960
using you point to move because i want

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,590
to show you that you don't need to

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,520
switch to do step at all you want to use

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:41,080
it ok very much better environment but

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,120
people mostly are thrown away by in the

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,930
face that's

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,390
a little bit outdated nowadays but it

00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,260
fits pretty well in to know me in the

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:59,890
face xiety menus is made with the

00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:02,230
application and meet you here this is

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,570
currently real-time and future versions

00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:09,490
you patent application it fits in your

00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:14,800
environment perfectly well so i will

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:17,200
show you this application first see here

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,790
to windows the intention of give the

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,610
application is just a mock-up of

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,660
demonstration of small app which you can

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,050
use to organize your developers the

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,540
project is tasked and i already put some

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:43,240
stuff into the database I can fetch it

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:46,240
now here see some developers then

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,780
project and this past that are assigned

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,560
to the developers they can now choose

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,570
one developer Nicola for instance and

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:02,730
say you should get the task assigned

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,730
Nicola which classically designed

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:15,000
estas when I saw pink there can tuck

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,000
vinia

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,599
i hope i get is fitting right

00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:31,240
and businesses misstep project

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,920
all the stuff stays in and shapes still

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,830
at first and I have to hit save to make

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:47,860
it possesses a database now I can quit

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:52,060
the application we started catch the

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:56,560
developer second and what I equalized in

00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:05,950
this task site and to show you this not

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:09,340
just sound really inside the application

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:17,040
I the different databases which each

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,040
other and you can see

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:25,860
this is the database in our table side

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:36,750
and if we look into this tables see busy

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,750
orders entries

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:52,690
the task table and you see all the tasks

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:56,710
tonight and is it it's usually making

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,410
database there were several tables and

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:06,220
you have to join those tables pioneer

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:08,650
nice very basic spell and like this is

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,139
good for the database in terrible to put

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,870
for working business but because of that

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:18,780
you want to make your own interfaces for

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,780
the database your applications

00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:33,399
it support is smart application now now

00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:35,319
I asking you should you can you guess

00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:40,719
how many lines of code I work for this

00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,459
application so you're going to live did

00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:46,839
not like it's written out I've effect

00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:49,169
until I both work and now i want to show

00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,869
you how to build such an application

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:56,709
with all the stores i mentioned the

00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:59,289
first we needed data model and for that

00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:04,989
i'm not trick you into leaving without

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:13,299
cost and doing some magic stuff i'm

00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:23,889
asking you two years from what about the

00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:26,759
database application should be ok well

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,169
what kind of the horizon what we

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,069
implement some kind of application age

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,069
any ideas

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:42,000
you're gone we can in Montgomery that we

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,880
meet them some amenities like for

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,760
instance lending library books okay

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:58,410
books entity you are table which is

00:06:50,760 --> 00:07:04,620
named and we want the library we want

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:21,720
also have from users Roger readers read

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:24,240
each one of us a book okay I mean you to

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:29,220
find out but in population goes both

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,280
energies are obviously the reader can

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,690
from levis and many books up to three

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:41,060
votes that's HS many make it too

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,060
complicated okay I

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:51,550
correlation first and when we look at

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:56,110
have any books what one book can

00:07:51,550 --> 00:08:01,360
actually be only or by one reacts read

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:06,430
by one we are no one too many relations

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,680
is rather simple and drifting the add

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,830
some original stuff to make it a little

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,320
bit more advanced but don't galaxy

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,730
radley are we tiniest and maybe start

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,140
with this first and add additional

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:28,950
features later though I show you now how

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:35,229
to create a data model that purpose we

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:37,950
need to make use of the am even modular

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,950
application

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:56,880
and if you use who patrols then you can

00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:01,930
install some of this stuff i'm using now

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,290
actually although in you but most

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,430
versions that are available that you put

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:12,400
a little bit by Britain they are limit

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,040
outdated you know give me an space of

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,790
virtual everything that goes a little

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,640
bit slow so I installed the stuff from

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:25,060
you going to patch installed over all

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,700
this latest version from svn we're a

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,330
little some toxic effects and so you can

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,710
use it now so don't be surprised if you

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,900
want to do it yourself and you install

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,000
this cup watch which comes out of the

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,810
box for when you go to that may be made

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,000
America great they are now you be more

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:53,170
none this is an application to map

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
database tables to objects which like

00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:01,360
essentially the same life and whatever

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,740
let's meet em entity normal from you

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,000
wanna pay or water and the lot levels

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,720
the modeling application for POF POF is

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,630
the end of class objects will work very

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,890
much it name but again would have became

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,930
available paper nevertheless and let's

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:31,660
not now

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:38,380
in a moment I heard set up for albany

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:41,110
now i am the person a couple of help

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,080
files minute and then i have made a

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,320
template for us which i create a copy

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
now

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:26,630
then we cover what we call this

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:29,079
application librarian baby hope's the

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,079
bookshelf

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:46,000
now I get the step length copied which

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:51,430
contains several files we need there's

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,160
em all those stuff that and educational

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:59,110
earnings later actually here's some coke

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,060
desire we had a prize the control of us

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:07,650
and everything else is still names like

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,650
Ross a new template i renamed us now

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,320
my desktop

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,570
sorry

00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,470
 with mistakes

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,949
now everything inside here country we

00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:38,930
need the cooling is just a little shell

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:48,610
script nothing and we are ready to win

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:51,170
the application back to you be maudlin

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,579
there's already empty model inside the

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,819
application template I've opened this

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,819
now

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,710
we need better shoes us without instead

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:14,730
this file called butcher we all one will

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,440
be when the distance for directory

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,690
because it's not actually hired to

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:25,190
bundle contains all the stuff to map the

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,190
object data to the database at the end

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:37,230
now we got an empty ego money and we

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:50,690
want to play X and it is first name my

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:53,900
first energy boss now did it crash I

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,440
can't eat anymore must have been crashed

00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:03,730
edit

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:08,920
just stick away what accident the icon

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:18,790
is going Papa nyamuk a neuron arrested

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:21,060
seriously it's three it's crushed ensure

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,060
that

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,740
now we had an entity here 2x is actually

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,850
called books and

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,200
Oh

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,910
actually mean chick better take a single

00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:07,110
dog where form Rita and cook because

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:11,280
it's bonus one entity here are several

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:14,790
other columns you can define a class but

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:20,610
you want to USB now resolved to be with

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:22,860
Jenelle record because we don't want to

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:27,980
do any special stuff you could do women

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,980
especially fine plus but not needed now

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:38,670
no here are no our energies first I give

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,220
you the database name the external name

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:46,350
is the name for the table any database

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:49,890
lay down and it's better to use

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,560
lowercase naming here because I found

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:57,830
some conference is the adapter to create

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,830
database of us okay

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,909
and maybe try to save it now we get

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:07,789
checking each there are several things

00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:10,299
been missing for instance here the

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,919
primary key for both engine is missing

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:17,960
wouldn't make a good kicker in the

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:23,029
database without keys that tips never

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:27,350
desperate we need or to do so we know it

00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:31,270
attributes and the first attribute is

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,270
preferably the ID

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:50,670
cuddle name she's in the deep and we

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,670
wanted to have them

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,950
and is

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:06,490
number this is clay's this is a class

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:12,760
one from Bob step or a clue step which

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:14,470
is used to implement number values an

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,679
external type is what's needed in the

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:22,769
database and fish was here in it because

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,769
we want to know not really another force

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,820
let me add an attribute the way to first

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,799
we make this first add this first time

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:38,289
attribute at the primary key and we make

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:43,720
the locket so that means if you change

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:46,470
it change this afternoon you can change

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,470
it basically

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,240
first the community book is the title

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:09,200
this will be an NS string the glass

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:14,450
which can hold string values and the

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:18,980
external time will be a variable

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:23,690
character then we make it quite long

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:31,549
let's say two to five fights since

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:35,510
sometimes long and we want to have a

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:38,779
good inside a glass visible this comes

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,919
the disc alone if you clicked it is a

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:50,630
diamond you'll make sure that and you

00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:53,659
can see it nem me just check the object

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,260
there the idea is invisible we don't

00:20:53,659 --> 00:21:00,679
want to mess with it and GJ two texts

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,500
completely control of its so kind of PHP

00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:06,740
or whatever who handles around these are

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:11,080
these we won't careful it's tough you

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,080
know object oriented and

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:19,850
gel column is where r is allowed to have

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:23,390
the entry quoted us with empty or not if

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:26,270
I click it it's allowed to have a book

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,680
without a title it makes sense no idea

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,240
like the tape that neither if you had

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,730
the data that you don't need to end up

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:43,630
everything at at the beginning then we

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,630
want another contribute a txt or so

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,060
you

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:15,919
also named conducted long it takes 30-60

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:22,779
screen characters in arena popular to

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,779
see abuse obviously also needs an ID

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:46,060
and people their first name your last

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,060
name it's just enough for now

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,960
another custom very American English

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,960
keyboard

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:12,289
it's all the attributes we need you save

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:16,549
it now there are no problems so far but

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:20,269
all about relational database and about

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:28,789
relations and so we need to model a

00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:33,049
revelation from reader to book so since

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:36,710
the book can be read by just one reader

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:43,389
but every reader can have many books me

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:43,389
to add in foreign key in the book energy

00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,309
this is called

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,090
look

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,700
I d means foiled again

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,560
and you need sleep same size as the idea

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:36,150
in the book editor of course as we can

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:41,700
join it and this will not be visible it

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:46,200
will not allow okay we can have books

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:54,380
the darkness then currently but I just

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:54,380
need ultimate purpose now or maybe limit

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:09,620
and now we are going to join those two

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:13,080
entities for that purpose me going to

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,320
cook every its read a very very big

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,320
mistake

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,590
we have purposely alien relationship

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:13,220
and since the natives are not that easy

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,900
to enter here we have an inspector for

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,940
that purpose we protect yourself before

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:28,929
but I believe it's time and we call that

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:28,929
religion read on 1-ranked enabled

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,860
and we go to inspector

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,830
and now we join

00:27:52,970 --> 00:28:03,840
community rita and they take the

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,890
resource reservation we going with a

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,780
very calming from reveal already and it

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:14,630
destination who put it here we are 30

00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,870
nectar

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:26,840
and now we're going to Zane for Drita

00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:30,320
click a reverse relationship and this

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:37,070
week all books because many books are

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:42,550
available and this goes again community

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:48,170
to the read every one facial many

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:52,070
connected now we can have a look at what

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:57,320
we have done in diagram editor and you

00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:06,470
can see that one looks similar to what

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:11,030
we hear it's really swapped around you

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:13,490
can use that to get a better impression

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,580
of what always so new models or one of

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,170
its usual repetitive and I've tried it

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,340
in the day what are you can use rating

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,340
later to you

00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:38,789
so now we got everything in our model

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:41,460
what we need now we need to now we need

00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:47,399
to create the appropriate database for

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:50,460
it and for that purpose we get an they

00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:53,940
generate SQL button here but we need to

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,760
first say which kind of database we want

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:00,779
and I'm choosing your post class as well

00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,630
because i like it and goes it's really

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:09,299
cool database as flight never used it

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:13,620
but this way and they can go down and

00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:17,720
outside outside nice guys outside put up

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,720
a Hanukkah yeah they cut

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:30,669
black ottawa's co-star leave a poster if

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:33,360
you pass for Tia's kamusta we host this

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,360
local host

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:47,980
report this as usually any database this

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:52,420
book shelf I had some troubles while

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:55,150
creating databases using is a vector and

00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,940
the end I realized you have to write

00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,670
database name in a lowercase otherwise

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,110
you get some unknown travels maybe

00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:07,750
Sobotka I mean one life doesn't matter

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:13,770
it has to be lower case now you can

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:17,830
generally SQL and is a great database

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:21,990
execute this then come now if look into

00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,990
Z into pgadmin

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,810
no doesn't taste as not real

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:49,860
hmm sure effect

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:54,480
but if this this doesn't work we can

00:31:49,860 --> 00:32:00,120
also save the stuff and SQL files on

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:03,899
there and do it mentally it's the memory

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,679
round that always helps don't know

00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,679
myself giving it

00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,590
they come on business

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:31,160
whatever maybe 1 should be closer

00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:46,260
now I should work out hopefully we can

00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:51,360
create tables and stuff like the way

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:53,820
it's supposed to be you can check here

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,120
several features you want to have three

00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,710
tables toilet a balloon you want some

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,810
tables articles I dropped a US resident

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:12,149
you see all the SQL its general right

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:16,130
here and I hope it works now sometimes

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,130
locks the D levels when I

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,690
I'm still in there and pgadmin

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,190
look

00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:44,919
no fumes your kibbles good Choi picked

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:18,540
because some reason it doesn't work hmm

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,310
whenever I drilled into traditional way

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,130
we just chose how to make the

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,050
application on with the other example I

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,200
guess you all know how to create tables

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,960
okay we're all right i think i'm no air

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:54,780
probably to me down almost done right

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:58,410
now we need a database vice we can't

00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:03,280
sure what you can use the other example

00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:08,100
it does no throw a limited area or the

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,100
whole thing is awesome everything done

00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:24,390
here is my blinds

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:40,370
grants and worked fine

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:43,810
we got our lives in here I think I

00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:49,300
didn't need to church two tables forever

00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:49,300
No now comes the interface part

00:36:52,660 --> 00:37:02,369
without purpose I go into another

00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:02,369
application which is called

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:13,380
gone for kamusta object collision Marla

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,900
it's basically a clone of the interface

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,900
builder from next level and

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:31,480
I hoping he prepared interface model

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,480
file now

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,210
the interface model file consists out of

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:56,100
CMS objects which are DZ realized at

00:37:51,210 --> 00:38:01,040
runtime and connected with proxies with

00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:04,200
the action code we now need the window

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,080
for two minutes actually you can easily

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:20,340
created by drag and talking the windows

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:24,450
out here we got a window and inside that

00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:32,550
window we need several and interface

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:35,490
elements to make those and object to

00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,850
show them to show those subjects at

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,850
attempt

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:48,320
this is in his table view which model to

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:52,150
just the table and give several columns

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:58,430
inside and we will bind each column to

00:38:52,150 --> 00:39:04,990
something out of the database first I

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:09,790
need to resize the stuff a little bit

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,790
you do back doesn't look correctly

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,580
and they leave out all the additional

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,040
stuff to return in the face I just need

00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:35,910
fault table titles and so long to be

00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:38,550
able big pasta now we need some button

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:46,110
which will trigger the action to

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:46,110
actually fetch those readers first

00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,850
some button to add arena and somebody to

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,850
remove one

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,410
now comes the interesting part

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:44,200
comisión international sports

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:44,200
applications and I'm now going to track

00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:52,720
them it's an entity over here

00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:09,450
into the and gone 11 is

00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,930
that's why at the table what did not

00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:36,490
in there

00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,890
window

00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,270
and as Tim of you

00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,540
some columns

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,460
sometimes

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,310
pitching

00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:04,819
now i sip this i can use it again that

00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,819
is the beach

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,180
maybe just watch the kids no it

00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,220
shouldn't was living in one version of

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,140
London's mccray if you have a non

00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:22,009
template but can we had attempted might

00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:25,269
be long to get quickly so ok now we're

00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:25,269
going to wireless all up

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:39,980
and I just drag the book inside here and

00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:43,530
what we've got now is editing context

00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:48,690
the steps for adding in context and this

00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:50,460
is a cemetery and Itzamna book entity

00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:57,150
anything context is something like a

00:45:50,460 --> 00:46:01,440
transaction you can use this editing

00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:04,849
context to make your changes editing and

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:09,990
then you talk within context day and

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:17,089
everything goes in three variables now

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:17,089
