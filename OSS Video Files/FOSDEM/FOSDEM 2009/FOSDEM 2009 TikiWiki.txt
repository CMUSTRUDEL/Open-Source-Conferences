I

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,520
you

00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,910
hi everyone settle down class this is

00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,010
going to be this is going to be a speedy

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,090
talk

00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,520
a challenge 15 minutes all right want to

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,100
talk about with the wiki way in mass

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,450
collaboration tikiwiki obviously at an

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,220
example of the Firefox support site now

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,170
what are the most important

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:40,489
collaborative projects in the history of

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:40,489
humanity anyone yes wikipedia what else

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:50,790
nothing else wikihow to okay what else

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,129
we could travel lots of wiki stuff how

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,570
about nine wiki stuff which is highly

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,610
collaborative international space

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,129
station okay but I did I did write

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,199
volunteer mass collaboration so i'm

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,570
guessing a lot of those people do that

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,549
for their job so i've asked this

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,190
question maybe 20 times in 20 different

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,580
talks and nobody has ever convinced me

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,150
of a better answer than Wikipedia so I

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,590
think it's quite fascinating that within

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,440
less than 10 years we have built

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,640
basically the largest collaborative

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,440
knowledge base now and when we use

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,330
wiki's for of course Wikipedia is the

00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,920
most known that's very obvious nah

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,990
encyclopedia a lot of people use it for

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,870
documentation for documenting a project

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,400
why is it efficient well more people use

00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,140
it for collaboration for project

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,080
management because it's flexible it's

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,120
adaptable lots of uses in corporate for

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,360
example the previous talk about xwiki

00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,790
very popular in in corporate space now

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,740
it's great for unstructured content but

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,360
you can structure it using tags and

00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,000
categories now why Ricky well here's

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
here's what I think so give someone a

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,510
fish and you feed him for a day teach

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,230
someone to fish and you feed him for a

00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,450
lifetime you all heard that now I have

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,430
that knowledge to a wiki and countless

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,370
people will be able to learn on their

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,120
own and share their knowledge and many

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,489
many

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,620
many more will feed their families so

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,620
it's all about empowerment that is only

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,269
one problem with this it's not good for

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,430
the fish because it right it tends to

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,599
have to get replete to overfishing but

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,430
then you have to have another wiki

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,629
unlike fish bank management so one of

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,250
the big things we're trying to replace

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,409
his email how do we have a more

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,230
efficient and then using email which is

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:44,250
still the most use application wiki's

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,709
are designed for that now what happens

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,989
when you apply the wiki way but to

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,019
software development okay think about

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,660
this not the wiki way to design content

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,870
to write content but the wiki world to

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,079
develop software okay now do this for

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,680
over six years and have over two million

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:08,359
25 people coding collectively on a

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,950
single code base and that use their own

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,709
to use the application for your own

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,220
needs that's what we buy dog fooding who

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,560
here has heard the expression dogfooding

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,260
okay so for the other ones imaging a

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,919
publicity about dog food and then they

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,709
say it tastes better have you ever

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,440
wondered who tasted it and who says it

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,690
tastes better so that really means that

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,970
you use your own tools to solve your own

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,879
problems and basically you suffer

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,750
through your own dog food before making

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:47,639
it available so what happens when you do

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,379
our rat is basically tikiwiki so it's we

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,150
found a bathroom so that's an acronym

00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,870
that you find after you've started the

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,449
project so it's basically tightening

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,660
integrated knowledge infrastructure so

00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,669
it's a imagine 200 people have added to

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,310
this and have solved their problem so

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,419
basically it's a huge application

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,209
there's a thousand pages of

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,220
documentation over a million lines of

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,109
code and that's why in 15 minutes I

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,730
can't tell you everything it does i just

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,489
want to get the message across that it

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,900
does a lot of things every two hours

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,810
there's somewhere in the world that's

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,450
committing some your code it's a started

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,270
PHP my sequel application you can run on

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,669
banana just about any host

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,530
it's basically a combination a hybrid of

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:36,000
content management system group were and

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:39,509
a wiki obviously now I just like copy

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,090
pasted the list of major major features

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,349
but just the first level features of

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,669
course you know we're preparing the

00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,590
slides we're not supposed to put more

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,729
than X words on a slide but I figured

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,580
this would get the point across and

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,490
imagine each one of those features has

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,259
other settings right so if you install

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,409
the fire gallery for example it has sub

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,120
feature sub settings so an hour there's

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,680
over a thousand settings and you'd meant

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,580
at all so it's a massive massive

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,190
application so that's good because

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,050
there's lots of features and what that

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,849
also means is that there's not there's

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,190
not the concept in like in your

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,620
applications of third-party modules

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,280
extensions add-ons whatever you call

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,960
them everything is in the court now

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,180
that's really good for some things it's

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,620
not so good for other things so the good

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,690
thing is that makes it easier to upgrade

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,360
it makes it makes it easier for all

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,849
these features to build there and it's

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,050
great because developers will

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:39,180
collaborate on these features um but

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,400
it's complex right so you really need

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,110
the two best use cases for you Tiki

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,060
Wicki is if you have lots of projects

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,539
and you always want to use the same the

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,099
same base to handle 20 or 30 or 50

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,870
different projects and you want you know

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,639
reuse always the same thing or if you

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,199
have one project or two projects which

00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,699
are fairly complex and you need lots of

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,770
features that's where tikki wiki is

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,110
really good if you just move the blog

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,029
although it's totally overkill and your

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,590
big more complicated than what you need

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:09,419
but you can do a blog anyway um the big

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,949
thing I see is about like people

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,250
collaborating on features and lots of

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,110
projects you have various modules or a

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,060
bonds that do more or less the same

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,039
thing in our case that's not the way it

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,529
works people will collaborate together

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,949
and because it's the wiki way they'll

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,300
collaborate to extend features now just

00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,759
I'll just throw in some features so

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,069
basically it's a permission system so

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,199
basically you have users that can be in

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,599
groups and groups can be in groups and

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,340
you have over 200 different permissions

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,139
just for the wiki you have 25 different

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,990
commissions so can i view the history

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,690
can i edit the page can i attach a file

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,290
can like comment and it's very very fine

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:53,080
grain and then each feature will have a

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,699
different number of features and we can

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,690
have these speech these conditions which

00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:00,610
are system wide or by item and there's

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,850
also a category level but category level

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,410
is not as fine grained so in terms of

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,970
permissions that's really that's right

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,710
an Internet setting it's really good

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,460
because you can really control who sees

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,710
what who can do what there's obviously

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,229
the wiki engine which is which is very

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,700
powerful some of the cool features rd

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,260
for example you can make a book you can

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,150
have a table of content have structure

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,169
typically wikia's will tend to be very

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,960
very well very unfocused very chaotic

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:31,450
well there's a way to to organize this

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,860
case using structures or tabs or

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,260
categories and all these features are

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,210
here so it's a very very powerful weak

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,479
engine if you just as a Ricky engine

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,760
it's very good now there's a tracker

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,260
like a flame generator so basically this

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,450
is to build applications so you can

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,100
build your forms for example I need to

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,710
anything that you would do in a database

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,960
or in a spreadsheet you could do web

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,599
based with our trackers feature so

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,830
basically just to give you an idea of

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,229
these are the field types you can have

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,660
so you can build I want a text field I

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,970
want to drop down I want checkboxes and

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,950
I want to make lists well you can do all

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:11,139
of that plenty quick without programming

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,340
and it's multilingual so basically what

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,010
that means is that you could create your

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,930
form your your your labels can be

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,210
multilingual but your drop-down menus as

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,690
well so we don't have to create several

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,970
forms for several different languages

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,990
this calendar pretty standard just for a

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,940
group prototype event event calendar you

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,130
have news news and blogs basically any

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,120
type therefore portal type system

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,180
discussion forums of course it's a

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,800
collaboration tool so discussion forums

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,930
which are quite quite advanced you can

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,279
integrate with a mailing list so some

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,620
people prefer male and where some before

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,030
people prefer to deform so they can each

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,130
be in our own world but things are

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,930
synchronized

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,190
and define image gallery so if you want

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,410
to have a more of a document management

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,720
system type thing we're just galleries

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,580
far sub galleries which one have their

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,160
different permissions you can have that

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,690
the file gallery in the wiki there's

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,730
something called staging approval this

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,980
is basically a way for people to have

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,560
the wiki way so you can have it open and

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,450
let people edit your content but it has

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,550
to be approved by someone before it goes

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,040
live so this gives you put the

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,020
possibility getting suggestions from

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,180
from for example your customers or

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,740
whatever but still having that tight

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,780
control and making sure there's not any

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,730
spam or nothing gets through even for a

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,810
minute okay so this is just use case

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,670
they're not going to read them because

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,620
it's just give you an idea of these are

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,730
the things that Tiki Wicki does very

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,380
well considering basically installer

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,580
this is this is the type of things that

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,380
it's really good at I'll just touch on

00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,850
the multilingual aspect that's really

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,320
one of the strong points typically in

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,140
the wiki world it's quite difficult to

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,850
manage translations because normally

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,280
when you translate something you wait

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,690
you're supposed to have the source

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,000
document is supposed to be complete

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,530
before you start translating of course

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,110
in the wiki world the source document is

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,670
never tried never finished so but you

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,930
still have to start translating so how

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,120
do you coordinate that how do you

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:14,230
organize that and tickle Vicki houses

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:18,040
system for that these are things that

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:20,380
ticular if you can do fairly well but in

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,660
some cases it's just like for example

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,760
you can have a blog wiki wiki but it's

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,120
just it should be easier but you can do

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,760
it you could use it for all these these

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,200
uses and this is still very good and

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,280
then you have a bunch of things that

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,170
icky Ricky doesn't do well yet but it is

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,850
our intention to eventually as we

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,790
involve more people as projects come

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,680
along to also improve these aspects so

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,480
as you can see it's it's a quite

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,850
ambitious to sell you know we're trying

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,500
to do everything and and some people

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,410
will say that's that's that's crazy and

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,510
maybe it is but so far so good so

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,090
basically people would just join in and

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,540
the thing is as you add use cases you

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,610
don't have to proportionally add the

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,259
same number of features you add a few

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:09,290
features and you can hit other use cases

00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:12,139
so one example of a site is there a

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,649
Firefox support site so basically I'm

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,290
what Firefox needed is a wiki based site

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,970
so for collaboration they need

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,380
volunteers to be able to to to

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,630
contribute it had to be multilingual

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,339
with good mud similar features and in

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,740
either the scheduler staging an approval

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,620
that's and they basically a contributed

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,110
that feature and that's a good example I

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,389
think of to open source projects working

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,069
together to improve and basically

00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,009
everything that's been done in this case

00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:41,720
is available obviously as open source

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,089
now so when you're exciting things

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,100
that's coming version 3 so a version of

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,899
three is coming out in a few months it's

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,490
already pretty stable in trunk for

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,199
anybody who who's a developer who's

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,380
being could be interested you can check

00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:56,060
out trunk it's working fairly well and

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,850
the big bull features our web services

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,339
semantic wiki links and the mind mapping

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,800
so basically more and more intelligence

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:06,350
on a metadata organization around the

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,170
wiki pages I will also have a new system

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,250
to manage large numbers of ticky wiki

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,990
installs now I've talked about one of

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,120
the things right that's often comes this

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,670
and it's like how can you have all these

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,170
features how can you have 225 people

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,930
working in the same code base and I

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,449
realize that that's not the car the most

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,120
common model the most common model is a

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,880
small core and lots of external

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,480
third-party add-ons that's not our model

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,310
now I believe but for what we're doing

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,500
our model obviously is better that's how

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,810
we'll work now the advantages are

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,760
there's no future duplication because

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,769
someone comes alone they have to work

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,199
with what's there so they have to extend

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,209
the existing features and there's

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,579
excellent code review because if you're

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,199
going to code something then you're

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,370
looking in a code you figure out where

00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,170
it's supposed to be if there's something

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,149
already there maybe it's not finished

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,980
maybe it's not quite there but you have

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,389
to extend it you can't just like oh I

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,040
don't like that I'm just going to start

00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,060
from scratch and that's that could be a

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,600
problem because you end up with all

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,100
these duplicate functionalities and here

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,560
here going to throw out something

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,899
as far as i know and i'm looking forward

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,579
to people correcting me tickle a key is

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,100
the web app with the open source web

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:22,040
applications will application with the

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,339
most built-in features as far as i know

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,290
if i'm wrong i'm sure someone here knows

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,329
and please tell me but as far as i know

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,040
that's the case and why because that's

00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:33,620
our motto other systems that are very

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,160
popular and very very important don't

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,660
have the same model so i guess i guess

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,850
that's the case but it does bring

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,139
challenges we will open up to key we can

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,209
you see the admin panel there's a

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,120
thousand checkboxes there's a thousand

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,769
different apps in settings to cover

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,209
these hundreds of features so that's

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,730
quite a problem there's a learning curve

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,319
there and it's quite difficult as well

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,899
what should be the sensible defaults

00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:59,839
because if you setting up an internet or

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,839
a public website what should be the

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,310
default for permissions for example so

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,279
what we've come up with is called

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,110
profiles basically profiles are low to

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,569
pre-configure a ticking Ricky it's like

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,470
a package of settings that are all

00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:17,060
together and because if you say like an

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,500
application is really good for the code

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,389
but the important thing is your

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,649
knowledge of how to use it right so

00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,240
that's why it's really cool if you need

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,730
help if you were setting up a system

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,259
with X and you have your firm that's

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,269
done it before it's great because the

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,490
first time you solve a problem it could

00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,380
take you five hours the second time it's

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,079
five minutes so it's very important to

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,120
have access to expertise now how do you

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,949
share that expertise so there's ways for

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,350
the code for coders to share to reduce

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,970
they just code but power users and

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,040
people that configure systems how do

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,319
they share it so what we can lap is

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,600
profiles profiles but it basically a way

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:53,420
to set a tick you Ricky in a certain way

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,730
for a specific issue problem use case

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,889
which is collaborative in a wiki page

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,680
and that could be shared and we could

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,130
easily have hundreds of profiles 14

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,410
chicky for charity one for multilingual

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,480
website alyssa's are limited and

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,800
basically those are shareable and

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,310
distributable so this

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,310
