I'll be going over some of the particular UI and workflow issues in editing, media uploading, and other areas that we intend to tackle, summarize some of the existing work toward those ends, and give a preview our upcoming Wikipedia Usability Initiative.

MediaWiki was born in 2002, when Wikipedia's editing activity outgrew the concurrency limits of its original wiki engine. The first 6 years of this open-source wiki platform's development were largely devoted to scaling and performance, ensuring that the world's most editable online encyclopedia could keep up with the number of articles, visitors, and changes that come with being an insanely popular user-written site. But the user interface hasn't changed much since 2003; if anything, packing in more features has made many aspects of the wiki harder to use over time.

In 2009, MediaWiki developers are turning their eye towards usability and design issues. As with the scaling problems we've tackled before, we have to be able to target anything from a tiny personal or intranet wiki to the massive Wikipedia sites, making a range of different use cases with different needs... It'll be fun!

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
