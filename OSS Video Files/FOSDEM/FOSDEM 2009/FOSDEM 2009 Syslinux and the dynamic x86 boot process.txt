Title: FOSDEM 2009 Syslinux and the dynamic x86 boot process
Publication date: 2011-12-22

Description: 
	By H Peter Anvin

This talk will discuss the x86 boot process, how to make it work in a dynamic system, and the tradeoffs between versatility and reliability. It will also discuss the Syslinux modular interface and how to use it to quickly add new features with a minimum of coding.

Originally written during an all-night hacking session in 1994 with the intent to better support the then-ubiquitous install boot floppies, Syslinux has evolved over the years into a widely used boot loader suite with an advanced modular interface, with emphasis on ease of use and reliability. It is now the most commonly used x86 bootloader for removable media, and is increasingly used for conventional hard disk booting as well.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
