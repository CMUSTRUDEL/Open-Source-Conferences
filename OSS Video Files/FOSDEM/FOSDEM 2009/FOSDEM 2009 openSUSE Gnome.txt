okay just closing the door first so uh

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,210
hi I'm the salsa I'm so first I'm French

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,210
so it's not Vincent its vessel which is

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,730
quite important you know so I'm going to

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,040
talk about what we are doing in the

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,680
chrome team what's new since the last

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,640
year what has changed in the workflow

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,219
basically a lot of change and I guess

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,469
it's quite interesting for that but

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,039
first let me talk just a bit about

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,690
myself because for I mean I'm beautiful

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,120
I think it's quite clear and it's

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,829
important to show that I'm one of the

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,489
most beautiful person of the on the

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,559
planet so yeah also I'm really serious

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:08,729
as you can see but my point is that I'm

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:12,150
also oops like that so stupid a lot of

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,760
thing idiot you can just come to me talk

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,280
to me make some comments I will always

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,619
be happy and have time for you so don't

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,810
hesitate to come to me or drop me a mail

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:28,070
or whatever but so first the motivation

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,470
of the gnome team as you probably know

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,600
we have quite some well we're a small

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,720
team in no Valentine novell who is

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,210
walking on opensuse integrating noming

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,240
up and susie but we want to grow that

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,790
team and to have people on the canal of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,070
the committee to walk on that team to do

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,030
all the stuff we're doing and the

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,840
question is why so ah the first reply is

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,369
this that I don't like to walk so I

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,969
would like other people to do what I'm

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:04,500
doing that's the first reply but it

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,630
doesn't really work well because

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,190
actually I'm walking a bit more since

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,289
we're involving outside people than

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,950
before

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:18,049
so that's not really the the good answer

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,480
the really really reality actual answer

00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:22,090
is that we want to do more stuff we want

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,939
to move faster and what we want

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,579
something which is better in the end

00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,709
what does it mean it means that we want

00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:33,290
to have more package we want to update

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,180
all the loan package faster like if you

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,939
look at all the other distributions when

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,299
there is a new comer release they have

00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:44,359
all the new versions of gnome in two

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:47,030
days and we didn't choose to do that now

00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:49,579
we're doing that actually we stopped

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,669
doing that and we want to do that better

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:54,680
what does it mean well we want to have

00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:57,019
the better packaging we want you have

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,950
less bugs all the usual stuff actually

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:03,280
and it turns out that if you use well if

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,290
you have a community who is doing that

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,720
the people who do that care about know

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,109
and they will do something of good

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,530
quality because they really care that's

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:18,799
really a big difference when you take

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:21,949
people like me I mean I care about you

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:25,159
know sure but I'm paid so I don't get

00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:28,190
that much maybe and that's not true but

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,379
I'm trying to explain the point and so

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,870
maybe I'm not doing the package that

00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,909
well if you take the community they will

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,359
always do the right thing that's the

00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:41,930
point because they care so it's a good

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,359
thing for the long term how are we yeah

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,879
some figures first maybe I think that

00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:49,849
will probably explain the point of the

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,280
genome community first the chrome team

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,939
maintain stain ten percent of the

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,010
package in opensuse so I'm just talking

00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:01,159
about the package that we have in opencv

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,419
factory right now really that's when you

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,079
look at the numbers this really ten

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,879
percent so that's a lot really a lot but

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,790
you might say that it's all small

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,000
packages that I know just the small

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,190
utility but actually no it's really ten

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,219
percent you look at the Dybbuk size of

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,989
all packages it's ten percents really so

00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:24,930
it's being it's really big big big so

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:30,690
it's a lot of work and we need people to

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:34,889
do that yeah we're good the chrome team

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:38,280
is really good when we released open z11

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,949
dot one we were frozen and we were still

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,750
frozen for a few weeks after that and we

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,720
had a small team of volunteers who start

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,330
working on packaging the new Nome and

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,690
they did that in their own projecting in

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,539
the build service and so we we merged

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:59,130
that after a few weeks and this result

00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:02,190
in 201 package updated and they were all

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:07,650
done by the community not novell people

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:10,650
so that's really impressive and if you

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,650
look at what we did last week last week

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,449
we did a one packaging day to update to

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,720
the latest no because we attack dome

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:22,250
release last week we means 100

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,520
submissions basically that's huge really

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,759
that's in that you have probably

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,630
something like 60 new version of

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,280
packages and then fixes to the package

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,860
so we put all that to chrome factory and

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,360
we would try to make sure that

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,509
everything compiled everything is

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,080
working fine like it character so that's

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:49,530
really turn approach the daily life of

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,909
technology I will try to move fast and

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,120
flat because if you all know that I

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:56,250
guess so we have a mailing list which is

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,099
called open signal we have an icy

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,530
channel opensuse genome we have lots of

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:05,009
people on both if you look at the

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,860
mailing list it's usually not that many

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,370
males because people took a lot on I see

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,740
actually so it's good to join both and

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,490
if you look at the RIC channel is quite

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,460
friendly people don't talk that much

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,759
about open sea dog gnome but they just

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,440
chat with each other and it makes really

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,759
a good atmosphere and it's why it's

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,000
working quite well I think so nothing's

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,440
day to come that's nice we don't really

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,830
kick people out of the channel 4

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,080
we don't like that that's bad we have an

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,900
ID by a wiki page where people can put

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,280
their idea they want to see become true

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,130
in the future of vintage ink gnome and

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,770
now we've decided with open fate to put

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,230
all the ideas that are good enough and

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,520
well developed in app and fate so that

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,130
we can really track them and make sure

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,760
that we don't lose track of everything

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,650
so we can quite happy with open face we

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,790
really happy that it's out and that

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,350
people can use it so it's good good good

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,390
it's really a good way to open to coming

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,940
to you even more we have weekly meetings

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:21,700
ah so all the usual stuff yeah thanks we

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,270
love a perfect really yeah weekly

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,730
meetings we talk about what's new the

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,010
potential issue we have what we want to

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,740
do in the next week for example we want

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,770
to do some specific event or stuff like

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,480
that do we have some specific bugs we

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,090
want to discuss some specific features

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,270
we want to discuss people need to test

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:47,050
something if it thing like that and the

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,230
important thing that we change the time

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,570
of the meeting so every two weeks we

00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,110
have a Time Shift meeting which is I

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,630
think something like five hours later so

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,070
people who are in Australia or India or

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:05,500
Israel they can all join and because the

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,230
usual meeting is fine for European and

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,840
American people but not for Asian people

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,700
or Australian for example so we want to

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,540
include everybody in which so that's why

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,370
and so we have specific event like

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,260
packaging days like I already talked

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,110
about we have birthdays where we have

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,050
all the team going through bugzilla all

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,330
the bugs and okay we look at this bug is

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,910
it is still valid in the latest release

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,510
do we want to extreme it all that stuff

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,550
that we should already do and we didn't

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,260
do in the bathroom so now we're starting

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:43,390
to do it really with the community

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,970
upstream that's probably one thing which

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,410
i care really about who i come from

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,509
upstream attitude

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,420
I want to consider to be really good

00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:55,329
with app stream and have one of the best

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,160
relationship with web stream so what

00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:03,149
does it mean it means accepting upstream

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:06,189
I 15 upstream is something which

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:09,100
destruction used to not do that well

00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:12,129
actually the best this means when

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:17,139
upstream does a new feature and we do

00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:19,839
not like it we sometimes use to remove

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,899
that feature or to change the UI to

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,209
change the setting but it doesn't help

00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,920
us in the end and it's something we have

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:30,879
to maintain and that we cannot maintain

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:34,779
so we have to accept what the film is

00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,459
doing and to go really with what

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,050
upstream is doing if we don't agree we

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,759
have to do that work upstream to change

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,899
what a friend is doing not to do that in

00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:46,329
the distribution also one important

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,279
thing that we have all the branding

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,509
packages I think it's a cool feature in

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,470
the pants you see that a lot of people

00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:56,439
don't know about it's all the settings

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:00,009
and you I change that we do are done in

00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:02,199
a separate burning packages so first of

00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,910
all we have j conf tube running upstream

00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,040
and chicken for two burning open Suzie

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,980
and if you want to have the default look

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,779
up gnome from upstream you just change

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,839
this package from burning up and city to

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,630
branding upstream and you're done that's

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,149
really quite awesome and when you talk

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,970
to people from upstream I did that a lot

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:24,430
of for them and they told me yeah open

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,069
City it's cool but I don't like the

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,350
panel of the bottom I really have want

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:33,160
to stock up stream and they didn't know

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,139
about that so it's really no other

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,630
distribution is doing that so that's

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,899
pretty it's a good way to accept a

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,250
string we want to walk up soon so that's

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:46,839
what I did when we don't agree on

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,149
features walk upstream to fix that this

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,059
also means when we do a patch to fix a

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,160
bug the first thing to do is not to put

00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,170
the patching of the package it's to send

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,959
it upstream and then put it in the

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,000
package that's quite important that also

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,320
means that when we have all the old

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,240
actress from well since 2000 I don't

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:14,350
know what maybe even 90 99 or something

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,050
like that uh well those patches went out

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,460
sat the stream and this is bad so we

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,010
have to send all those batteries

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,960
upstream we had like seven hundred

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:28,030
bachelors in Nome and there were we

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,490
didn't know what the status was well it

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,320
sent upstream or not we don't know so we

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,530
start tugging patches with some key

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,570
words like this is a patch for upstream

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,370
or which is specific for apartments you

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,520
see because we need to integrate with

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,980
this picture of just for example this is

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,080
a patch which is a feature or just a bug

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,110
fix and then we put the burgh number

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,200
from bugzilla novel bugzilla or bug

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,330
number from non vanilla and with small

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,860
descriptions this is really really

00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:03,300
useful to get upstream all that we have

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,740
and then to have less walk on opensuse

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:12,970
helping upstream is also quite important

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:16,000
a good example of that is probably what

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,089
I last week or two weeks ago I did a

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,790
small script which exports all the the

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,310
tree of open suse factories so we can

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,080
have all the packages and people can see

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,120
the files which are in the package like

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,850
all the patches of the spec file and

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,490
they have a link to download that so

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,770
people didn't have that before you

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,220
couldn't just bros open to see the

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,960
source code and for extreme is quite

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,990
useful to know what the distribution is

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,750
doing with you module I used to do that

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,520
a lot and I'm still doing that from my

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,070
upstream point of view when I look at

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,650
non panel and i want to add all the

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,170
patches i go on an Ubuntu website i go

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,570
on the federal CVS I go on a man rivers

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,330
VN Suffolk that and I couldn't do that

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,940
before without opening a build service

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,320
account for advanced fee and a lot of

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,040
upstream people don't want to do that

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,250
they just want a simple webpage so we

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,930
were not helping a stream so i did a

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,090
small script that export all that and

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,280
since then we had quite so many people

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,920
looking at that quite um we had some

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,720
people sending a small mail or honors it

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,280
just chatting and telling well there's

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,220
the small thing in your packet which is

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,220
not quite right so this is quite useful

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,260
so we want to also make it possible for

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,170
upstream developers to use open Susie

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,200
and feel comfortable with that so it

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,200
means when they want to develop known

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,500
for example we want to make it easy for

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,560
them to just in cell one package on one

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,140
meter package of whatever and then say

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,850
okay now i can compare what whatever i

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,920
want from genome svn I have all the

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,570
dependencies already installed that's

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,370
fine so some black magic for them

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,320
because they don't want to care if they

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,630
want to only develop one small module

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,150
upstream we have to do that to help

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,630
upstream develop stuff and we're

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:18,120
planning to do all that so the build

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,730
service the realtor is probably

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,660
something which change completely the

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,460
chrome team because before the

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,890
wheelchair is only novell people could

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:34,320
walk on packages and now this has

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:36,150
changed so we were one of the first team

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,580
to really adopt completely the build

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,650
service when Open City start being

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,440
completely compiled in the build service

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,740
we completely switch all the people from

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,340
the gum team and all their have some

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,990
vice reason for that some people believe

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,940
that it was better to use the same tools

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,240
as outside contributors which I think

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,340
it's true it's a good thing and also

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,470
people which web just annoyed that they

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,240
had to use some VPN to access to the

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,110
internal servers and they didn't want to

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,640
use a VPN of water and but the in the

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,190
end people just want her to have this

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,790
really same level of access than all

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,820
other contributors so we start doing

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,700
that we had some issues at the beginning

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,310
we lost some change that word on the

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,740
bill terrace which were just disappeared

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:31,740
in some ways but we're still happy then

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,850
we're also heavy users of it and some

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,830
people might abusers because we have

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,840
tons of packages we have more than one

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:45,480
project so it's a really big usage of

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,090
the build service resources that's

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,320
really heavy we're trying to walk on

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:54,450
that we need to fix a few things we

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,850
might need to split the project we don't

00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:06,660
exactly know that yeah we will fix our

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:08,040
resources or that so known factory I'm

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,720
not sure that if you been doing

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,080
everybody knows how we working actually

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,270
soil try to expand quickly factory is

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,790
the development distribution of open

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,220
Suzy and it's developed in the open Suzy

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,970
factory in the build service genome

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,400
factory is the project where all the

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,230
genome of dates are done and then when

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,100
we happy with them we pushed them to

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,690
open Susie factory so that's where all

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,090
the action is going for the chrome team

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:43,470
basically and yeah that's why we have

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:45,900
all the 360 or whatever packages it's

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,050
moving quite fast lots of updates in

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,870
school and we we are trying to make that

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,240
useful for daily use so people can just

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,120
use this repository and have the latest

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,150
know all the time we're walking on that

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,400
and some people already start using it

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,209
on the main desktop so that's pretty

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,920
cool so but we have known factoring but

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,860
then we have known factory next gnome

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:16,170
stable and more so grown factory next is

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,089
the next version of Nome the latest

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,980
updates when we cannot updating no

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,280
factory because we've frozen for example

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,100
so at the end of a development cycle

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,750
when we just in bug fixed mode and some

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,580
people want to start packaging if the

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,590
new stuff because they get excited about

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,410
the new upstream features they can go

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,060
wild and do that in chrome factory next

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:39,780
it's what they did in back in December

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,740
so it's pretty cool and so non-factory

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,740
next is actually

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,510
people can just submit anything they

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,930
want and the important to review is done

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,720
when we match to don't factory and then

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,700
we have noms table sonam stable is

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,350
something we use to have and we stopped

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,310
doing at some point and we we are

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:04,500
starting to do that again it's a just

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,560
some projects to get the latest stable

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,870
version of Nome available like for

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,220
example in opensuse it went one we ship

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:18,270
don't 224 dot one or the two a mix of

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,980
the of both actually and upstream is

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:26,460
continuing to develop to some bug fixes

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:28,650
and has raised 22222 2403 so some users

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,200
want to have that because they want to

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,020
get the latest stable version of dome

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,750
they want just the fixes not the new

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,280
features so we are starting to to

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:44,390
package all that and we plan to do that

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,790
for more than one distribution actually

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,910
so all right now we are building genome

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:54,990
factory for factory but also for open to

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:58,020
z11 dot one which mean that no 226 will

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,630
be installable from open seas 11 dot one

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,200
if people don't want to create this is

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,030
pretty cool people like to not have to

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,100
bridge all the time their distribution

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,550
but they might want to have the latest

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:14,390
go so we're doing that it's some

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:18,920
overhead for us but it's manageable and

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:25,350
user ha users are happy so that's pretty

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,980
OS signal this is really the cool stuff

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,410
of the stock actually really exciting

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,530
this is what made the Builder is fully

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,490
usable for us and this is how we are

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:41,460
able to get all that stuff that quickly

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,590
so it's basically os os see is the come

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,470
online which is used to manage your

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,680
packaging the builders NOS ignore is a

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,410
small plug in which is not that small

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,870
anymore because it's like one third of

00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:59,040
the code of AC

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:01,590
it's quite big actually but the goal is

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,180
to make it easy to manage updates to

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,970
send an update and to build the stuff

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,630
and to manage from the administrator of

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:13,830
point of view of the project non-factory

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:18,210
so we have a few we have two supplements

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm missing a slide here this slide

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,690
which explains that we have some meta

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,350
data on all packages this mentality is

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,840
about where is upstream located why can

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,970
I get the latest double and with all

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,330
that we have a script which goes ups on

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,880
the websites up stream and download the

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,720
latest double vision so we can know what

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,760
is the latest upstream version we don't

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,679
have anything like that yet in open city

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:52,650
in a general way except mark your script

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:54,660
which get some news verbs which gets the

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,340
latest version from assist feeds and

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:02,580
stuff like that this is a bit more

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:05,790
stronger yeah because you can put more

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,160
stuff in it's really reliable so then we

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,200
have always think gnome to do it use

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,800
these database which is on a website and

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,820
you just run that and then you can see

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,380
what's what you can do actually you just

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,940
have some free time when you want to

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,059
update to a new package so you type 0

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,740
signal to do and okay i see that deuce

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,860
package i can update to a new version

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,520
and sometimes it's hard sometimes it's

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,820
easy when it's easy and when it sounds

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,520
the first step is to do OS signal update

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:43,350
this is really the magic command this

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:46,170
command does a branch of the package in

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,720
your branch of gum factory it then

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,570
downloads the branch check checking out

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,770
it then downloads the latest obscene

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,440
version double it then adds this double

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,840
to IC dot to the belt service remove the

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,240
old double start updating the spec file

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,900
to update the version for example start

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,500
updating the change file tools just put

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,290
the head

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,620
say that you update to the latest change

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:16,020
I just hope in version sorry and it

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,210
extracts the news file of the change log

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,900
file it shows you a deef of what's new

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:26,430
and so in the best case what you have to

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:29,370
do is open the change file open the

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:36,600
thief of the news file copy paste what's

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:38,750
new and commit new done so what you used

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,580
to do manually before it's black magic

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:47,880
just run one commanding it does all that

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:52,640
it's really really cool so this does the

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:57,360
first batch then you have built some it

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,970
buildzoom it is also quite awesome this

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,870
is a command which takes what you have

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,910
in your locale check out commits it

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:09,030
start a built on the lookout on the bill

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:12,780
terrace which means we have a policy in

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:16,020
the the branch for genome factory to not

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:20,070
build by default because if we like I

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,460
have like 100 package which our branch

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,290
and I don't want them to be rebuilt all

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,160
the time I just want them to be built

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,870
when I need that so bill simmons stop

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,860
the world so it enables the built on

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:37,350
world service and it waits and so i can

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,490
monitor what's going on and after a

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,650
while when i see that it has succeed on

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,870
this architecture and on this one you

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:50,100
will just submit the new package took

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:55,260
non-factor so the usual workflow you

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:58,740
have is use OS signum to do okay you

00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,620
take okay Pongo as a new release OS X

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,040
norm update Pongo you don't want this

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:10,050
effort nothing to do just magic you

00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:13,920
change your local directory CD angle you

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:18,120
open the dot change file you open the DF

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,190
of the news copy paste way signal built

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,549
emit and you're done

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,830
you let that surf walk you do not have

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,519
to monitor that if you don't want so you

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,899
can update that during the night and in

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,549
the morning you will see that it has

00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:35,309
been submitted or not to clone factory

00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:37,860
so it's pretty cool it's a good way to

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,679
update like five or ten package at the

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:45,360
same time without hearing that much if

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,250
it's easy to do this explains why we

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,379
have some people able to do all that

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:55,100
work easily so with that we enable all

00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:59,129
the community to do the ad work for us

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,779
which is particular this was my goal on

00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:03,870
the first slide you remember I did not

00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:06,120
want to do anything anymore but then

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,100
actually that's not true because we have

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,389
to review all the change we have to make

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,830
sure that people are doing the right

00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:15,600
thing and so now what I used to do

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:20,730
packaging has changed to reviewing

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:24,480
change which is actually not easier it

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:27,990
takes me even more time but the cool

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,090
thing is that after a while we get the

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,059
people who are building all these

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,429
packages they will get they will just do

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:38,159
the right thing package this package at

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,340
the right way they won't do it errors

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,399
anymore and my review will be just how

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,009
perfect except and so I will have

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:51,269
nothing to do anymore so yeah good i

00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:54,210
will be happy so this is really how we

00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:56,730
start building the chrome development

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,149
team in open city we as you probably saw

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,340
earlier we have people already doing all

00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:05,730
the weekly meetings walkin on them with

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:08,549
wiki walking on the burgh days we didn't

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,279
need the built it for that but having

00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:14,700
the real service noe signal made more

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,710
people come and it made the home team or

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,470
life so it tries fairly critical to

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:25,549
success so um

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:28,100
we have the few people in Nome team

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:32,090
actually more than a few on issue look

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:36,640
at I see we have probably like 60 people

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:40,010
in average I think on the channel and

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,919
okay not everybody is talking and when

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,720
you look at the stats you have to like

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,390
three people who are really talking all

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,950
the time and but and they're not noble

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,400
people actually so it's quite

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:57,860
interesting but so we have some cool

00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,440
people and lick no team you have all

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,270
these lists of people I won't read their

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,610
name because I wouldn't be able to

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:08,960
pronounce this one for example correctly

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:12,789
I guess so just to show that and if you

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,490
look at that list I should think that

00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:20,000
you have something like five people

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:24,500
working at novell on opensuse you have

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,820
one person working at novell on linux

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:32,539
things but well sled and all the other

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,419
people are volunteers and they are doing

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:39,200
all the work actually everybody there is

00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:41,600
doing all the work and so this is just a

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,450
small selection the way way way many

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,669
more people actually and I just did that

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,970
least a few minutes ago so it's not

00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:52,390
complete at all but you tell you that we

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,950
don't have just novell people and that

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,350
this is just the beginning we want more

00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,210
people than that in dome team so yeah

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,659
but we're doing good so that's quite

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:06,080
cool and also we have two people

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:09,230
federico and rayon which both of them

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,570
are on the open sea seaboard so we're

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,870
quite proud of that that's something I

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:17,890
didn't talk about before but we are

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,840
doing some stuff inside the chrome team

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,700
but most of the people are quite active

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,030
in open seas in general and not just in

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:30,200
the norm team so we have people who are

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:33,480
on the board for example we have Magnus

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,610
who is quite involved in like

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,630
just testing look at the the

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:41,340
distribution factor e-mailing you're

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:45,390
helping users stuff like that but not

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,150
just for Nome all these people doing the

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:52,320
same actually my stuff we are doing like

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:54,419
OS signal well it's good for gnome but

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,790
truly it's something that we want the

00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,710
upon all open city community to use so

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,049
we have to walk on that to make that

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,730
available to everybody to find a good

00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,000
way to integrate that you know SC

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,190
directly to integrate what we need to

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,620
integrate things and build service if we

00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:16,559
can we want also a small script that I

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:19,080
did to two bros the Europeans resource

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,419
it's just full of the gnome team is so

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,240
skillful known upstream but it's also

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,520
quite useful for all the people in

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,270
opensuse so it's something that we want

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,640
to be used stuff like that so we're

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,590
trying to do our stuff first of the

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,390
prototype for the ground team but then

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,700
we want to extend all that to open Susie

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:43,230
what is working fine for us I think

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:46,410
we'll walk fine from other people so

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,660
yeah I guess that's it if you have any

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:53,360
question I get some time for questions

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,360
so I welcome all questions

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,820
Oh microphone

00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:15,619
Oh beings a packet is it copying the

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:19,789
package or is it creating a submit

00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:25,940
request no it's a bill through so will

00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:30,829
some it is it's commits from Allah to

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:33,499
director bits of it it's built it

00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:35,809
commits you stuff to your branch it

00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:40,129
starts built and then does a submit

00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:42,649
request so it detects that you package

00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:45,889
is really a branch it looks for the

00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:49,329
developer ject and commits there well

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:49,329
not that you will project the parent

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:15,380
I'm in opensuse bill to add a package

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:22,460
program java program somewhere else I

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:22,460
learned all of the stuff my car pm's o

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:42,809
is a question that do you have to learn

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:45,539
how to package ok I'll leave you that so

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:48,720
if nobody has packaged what you want to

00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:51,690
package yes but the thing that on the

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,929
Builder is you already have many many

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,850
people who have package at tons of stuff

00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:03,330
so you're likely to find somebody who

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:07,049
has done the work for you yeah so

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,399
usually I mean usually you won't have to

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,049
to build the page if the package to

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,049
yourself usually yeah

00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,290
sorry

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:41,720
well is a OS signum command working for

00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:46,160
any any other package that the package

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,679
that are available in Nome factory it

00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,380
goes for example if there is already a

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,049
package that is existing on another

00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,150
project from the build service can I use

00:32:54,049 --> 00:33:00,890
this package and branch it and submit it

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:05,980
to to signal factors all the signal code

00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:08,720
is quite generic now we actually have

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,720
other projects which are usable with it

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,030
it just I just have to know which

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,400
project we want to use it for that so I

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,760
can create the database on the website

00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,340
for that and then when you use I signo

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,510
me use your OS signal dash dash project

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,250
and the name of the project so yeah you

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,900
can use it with whatever you want we

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,150
just need to know on the server side

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,919
that you want to use it with this

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,770
project so that we can create the

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,440
database for you okay and if I don't

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:42,200
want to use a submit command can I use

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,950
it without any database so you can use

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,320
OS signal built yeah which is like build

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,120
submit but it does not do the last step

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,360
which is submitting to the current

00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,130
project also you can set the built

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,470
monitor what's going on and it will tell

00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,580
you if it does fail or succeed great

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,580
which is pretty cool

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,710
any other question

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,590
