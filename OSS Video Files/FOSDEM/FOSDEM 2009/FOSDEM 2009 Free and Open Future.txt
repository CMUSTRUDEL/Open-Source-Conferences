Title: FOSDEM 2009 Free and Open Future
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2009
Description: 
	Freedom, openness and participation have become a pervasive part of digital life. 250 million people use Firefox. Wikipedia reaches people in 260 languages. Whole countries have Linux in their schools. Flickr hosts millions of openly licenses photos. Apache underpins the Internet. We have moved mountains.

At the same time, the terrain has shifted. Our digital world has moved into the cloud. And, our window into this world is just as often unhackable phones in our pocket as it is flexible computers on our desktop. Hundreds of millions of people take being digital for granted, and rarely stop to think what it means. The world where free and open source software were born is not the same as the world they have helped to build.

It's time to ask: what do freedom, openness and participation look like 10 years from now? How do we promote these values into the future? Building the open web and hackability into the world of mobile is part of the answer. Promoting privacy, portability and user control in the cloud are also critical. But what else? Mark Surman will reflect on these questions and chat with the FOSDEM crowd.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

anyways thanks for having me here it's

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:17,259
it's kind of weird to be here on the

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,689
stage at foz damn certain it's a huge

00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:21,520
honor but it's also something where you

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:23,439
know I've watched for from a distance

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,480
for years watching talks on video and

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,920
not going to have watching a bunch of

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,779
people who are way smarter than me come

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,910
up here and talk and certainly who have

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,309
done way more than me to kind of build

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,690
free software and build open source and

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,360
I've learned a lot from this and so it's

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,600
kind of a big huge honor to be up here

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,250
and what I want to talk about today when

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,140
Phillip and others kind of asked me what

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,309
the subject would be is really just a

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,290
little bit about the future and the

00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,320
future of a free software and open

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,570
source and beyond that and you know

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,589
really when I I kind of sat down you

00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,119
know it's a funny thing when your

00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,280
proposed titles for talks you don't know

00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,780
really what you're going to talk about

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,369
when I sat down to think about it really

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,629
it was just I want to talk about the

00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:04,210
things that I've been thinking through

00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,340
since starting at Mozilla the last

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,409
little while and you know I need to come

00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,760
in and say I'm I'm not a programmer I'm

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,920
not a coder I'm kind of like an

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,750
organizational nerd I you know I think

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
about how foundations work and how all

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,829
these kind of things fit together and so

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,390
you know this actually may end up being

00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,530
a bit of a boring talk for you because

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,390
it's the stuff I've been thinking

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,240
through as I think through my kind of

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,119
organizational nerd phase of starting up

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,329
at Mozilla so bear with me if it's a bit

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:34,060
boring and I wanted just set up some

00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,399
context in terms of what that stuff is

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,140
I've been thinking about I spent a lot

00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,140
of time in the last few months thinking

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,729
what is Mozilla for and you know I

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,109
probably came in a little bit with with

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,210
the assumption that a lot of people have

00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:49,149
is that Mozilla's there to build firefox

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,429
or Mozilla's there to build sea monkey

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,889
or Mozilla there to build thunderbird or

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:55,630
bugzilla but interestingly enough when

00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:58,060
you go and you start as an executive

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,310
director at a foundation you go back and

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,009
you read really boring things like the

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,399
incorporation papers so five years ago

00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:08,850
when the mozilla foundation was set up

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,010
the mission statement was basically this

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,740
that Mozilla is there to go the open

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,820
nature of the internet and it also says

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,110
in that and so this is actually

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,620
basically a photocall

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,080
of the mission paragraph of visuals

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,520
incorporation papers and it also says

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,950
that Mozilla's there to build open

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,710
source software that helps people have

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,590
free access to the Internet it also says

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,150
Mozilla is there to promote innovation

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,910
and give people technologies that they

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,280
can reuse and make the internet better

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,600
but ultimately it comes down to helping

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,450
guarding the open nature of the internet

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,010
and it's a pretty broad mission and a

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,750
part of the the job that we have is

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,910
thinking through though that means and

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,500
how some of this came up is in Mozilla

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,050
spent a bunch of time in the last three

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,140
months figure out what his goals are for

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,140
the next two years oh I now so I'm being

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,450
cut off on the edge a little bit and so

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,030
you know that was a good discussion it

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,890
came up with four goals you know some

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,270
broad goals about promoting openness and

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,130
participation on the internet obviously

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,950
a continued focus on Firefox a new focus

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,140
on mobile which is quite critical and a

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,959
continued focus on keeping people's data

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,489
safe and so you know that was interest

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,930
discussion some of it was hard most of

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,220
it was fairly straightforward all of it

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,690
ties back to that broad goal but you

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,700
know I also started thinking if that's

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,040
really the mission guarding the open

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,180
nature of the internet and doing that

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,370
with other people because certainly

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,190
Mozilla can't do that alone and doesn't

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,140
doesn't presuppose to do so that's a

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,209
long-term mission it's a 50 year or a

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,799
hundred year mission and certainly I

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,390
think openness and participation will be

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,860
a part of that mission for a long time

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,810
to come but I don't know whether

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,190
building a web browser 50 years from now

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,320
is what Mozilla is going to need to do

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,140
or any of the other things hopefully the

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,900
mobile space will be fixed so you know

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,760
those goals will change so that's that

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,739
sort of stuff that I've been thinking a

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,140
lot about and it's really just the

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,330
context for for the talk I want to give

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,040
and the talk I want to give is is kind

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,690
of much broader about where is the

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,390
future going but also a little bit of

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,880
where this group of people in particular

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,650
have have come from and what it means in

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,820
terms of me thinking about that broader

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:24,780
Mozilla mission actually can you let me

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,710
just I'll get on myself get my water I

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,710
thought Simon was there

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,970
so I want to make one point first in

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,440
terms of going through this talk

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,780
hopefully it's not a controversial point

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,340
maybe it's a boring point that free and

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,990
open source software have been a huge

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,460
success story and I want to talk a

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,870
little bit about what what I think that

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,360
means or one of the things that that

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,090
means but then I'm going to dig into two

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,450
questions one is how far can free and

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,350
open go and particular Ken the ideas

00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,120
that have brought us this far and

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:02,040
software go beyond software and if we

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,540
can go beyond software what's next what

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:10,680
immediately is ahead of us so let me get

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,360
first into that point so I think we

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,550
actually just had an interesting year

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,700
behind us if you think about the broader

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,990
world what happened in 2008 a bunch of

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,419
things that you probably remember like

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,830
the Olympics you may not have known it

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,660
was the International Year of the potato

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,580
but according to wikipedia it was and it

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,490
was a Spice Girls reunion tour last year

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,490
did anybody hear a tender spice no okay

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,400
there's also a really interesting year

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,770
for free and open source software I

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,060
think a very successful year not that

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,919
there haven't been successful years

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,700
before but three statistics of which I

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,340
could pull many many more are wordpress

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,010
is running 32 percent of the top blogs

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,860
on the web and if you look at other free

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,280
software that runs blogs it's it's much

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,039
bigger that's well over fifty percent

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,750
firefox past 200 million users and i get

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,060
different reports all the time but it

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,900
sounds like it's served to 30 to 50

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,389
right now so that's huge and I actually

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,750
think one of the biggest surprise

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,740
successes of 2008 was about I mean

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,450
there's different numbers flowing around

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,500
four and a half million Linux netbooks

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,840
and that was a huge break out in terms

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,180
of people who hadn't thought about using

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,270
free software having access to a lot of

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,560
flexibility and great software on Linux

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:38,520
netbooks and I guess that the point

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,160
about all those last three statistics is

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,470
that

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,970
those pieces of software and when you

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,090
look at minutes all the pieces that are

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,670
rolled up inside of it are touching you

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,110
know tens small hundreds of millions of

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,720
people right that we're talking about

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,460
yourself we're being a mass consumer

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,810
phenomena something that is touching

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,580
huge huge numbers of people and how how

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,430
it got to that place obviously is a lot

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,620
of hard work but it's partly that there

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,910
was a clear conceptual map that you know

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,320
what is it I don't know hundreds of

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,390
thousands of people small millions of

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,950
people around the world can all turn to

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,420
to figure out how they do this stuff

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,770
even if they disagree even if they've

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,440
got different things that they're trying

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,650
to build and you know the map is pretty

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,080
clear that it's those four freedoms and

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,370
I guess the the thing that is

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,990
interesting when you look back at

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,600
getting to that success and then when

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,790
you look into the future you know those

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,310
started out as something about copyright

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,440
but they become something much more they

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,290
become something which is kind of like a

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,700
design framework that helps people think

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,680
about the values that they're putting

00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,510
into software they go build and it

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,520
becomes you know as it says on the

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,320
screen a bit of a map right and it's

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,670
easy for lots of people to get to the

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,290
same place if they've got a map and

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,020
what's interesting with the mask kind of

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,820
consumer success of those and many other

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,910
free software products it means that

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,280
many millions more people have access to

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,680
those freedoms they may not use them but

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,960
it really is something that has reached

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,010
out and touched huge numbers of people

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,600
and you know from my perspective what's

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,669
important about touching those huge

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,190
numbers of people is that that's moved

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,110
the market it's move the market in a way

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,020
that other people who aren't building

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,140
free software have to pay attention to

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,060
fact that those values are built into

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,050
mainstream products that people are

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,210
using around the world and I hope and

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,250
this is a little optimistic it's move

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,960
the market to create a world that's a

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,150
little bit more hackable those products

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,740
even if people are using those freedoms

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,380
in terms of actually hacking the code

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,790
arm or bendable configurable and I think

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,730
reflect the values of the people who

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,160
built them

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,209
and then people are able to do things

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,560
with their software that they weren't

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,170
able to do before and certainly that a

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,300
lot of lockdown commercial mentality

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,850
people making software wouldn't have

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,660
thought to let them do and so I think

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:05,209
that's a good thing and the question

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,279
which pretty should be pretty obvious is

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,860
who did this who got us to this point

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
wear masks there's a mass consumer

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,459
phenomena of a more hackable world or

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:19,250
that we have the seeds of that it leaves

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:22,339
you did this is the group of people who

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,500
built that and if you think back nine

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:28,430
years ago or you think back even further

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,190
you know 25 years ago it was pretty hard

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,579
to imagine when you know that a

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,690
Microsoft monopoly and a web that wasn't

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:38,959
clear if it was going to be open or

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,490
closed would actually start to have some

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,370
cracks put in them and you guys put

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,199
those cracks in that foundations and

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,970
built those huge successes of free and

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,529
open source software so you sure i could

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,920
give yourselves a huge round of applause

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,920
for that

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:02,579
and I actually I don't have a dose it is

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,920
but thank you for that picture so we're

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,939
credited on the side but if you're here

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,959
I'd love to meet you and thank you for

00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:11,040
that picture and buy you a beer so that

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,509
was when we're supposed to clap when it

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,579
said celebrate let's go on to the first

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,459
question so first course I wanted to ask

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,259
is how far can we go take free and open

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,049
and you know I'm asking particularly

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,709
about software and talk a little bit

00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:27,110
about you know what are the values that

00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:31,829
are in free and open source software

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:35,489
mean for the web so let's actually now

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,860
step back a little bit in history 2003

00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:40,319
five years ago not that far back in

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,579
history you may remember some of these

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:42,959
things although it's a little bit hard

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,329
to remember that was in the first

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,649
european constitution was drafted you

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,119
probably didn't know it was the

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,559
International Year freshwater probably a

00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:52,199
little bit more important than the year

00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,449
of the potato and unless you're from

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,860
Britain or one of its former colonies

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:58,799
you probably didn't know that a cricket

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,540
world cup happened in 2003 but in fact

00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:06,799
according to wikipedia it did 2003 was

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,209
also a year that the web was in danger

00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,069
it was a year where the web was very

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:15,959
different than what we can remember

00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:18,389
right now so here's one reason the web

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,279
was in danger here's market share

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,579
statistics for internet explorer in July

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,049
28 2003 so I don't know people back and

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,160
see these numbers but and they don't

00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,910
quite add up to one hundred percent

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,179
which makes him little suspect but 97.3

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,999
for for ie6 a bunch of the little stuff

00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:39,779
for I five men little tiny bits from

00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:40,360
Mozilla bra and Netscape we were very

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,459
clear

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,920
and I don't think there's any dispute in

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:49,450
this room in a very different situation

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,050
of monopoly on the web in 2003 and you

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,140
know as recent events on this continent

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:59,920
indicated that monopoly is still having

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:02,290
effects and is still a concern and what

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,089
are some things that that monopoly was

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,029
leading us to in terms of what the web

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,160
would be this is something that you

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:11,680
probably haven't seen very much of for a

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,779
while blow it up so you can see the back

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,690
online application of available for

00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,550
internet explorer used to see a lot more

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,510
of this or things like at pages that

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,050
didn't work if you weren't using

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,450
internet explorer interesting enough to

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,940
help from the domain name this is a

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,459
clean South Korean government website

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:35,050
and since we have made a decision that

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:38,290
it's authentication for secure sites

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,390
would be done by activex and not using

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,390
you know a public open certificate

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,339
system and and it's still the only

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,709
country the world works that way so here

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,050
to any banking site in Korea or you go

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,640
to any government at AE government

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,140
secure site you're still going to get

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,420
this message I got this message three

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,970
days ago when I tried to pretend to

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,750
apply for a visa on a comment website

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,920
that's where the web blog is going it

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,180
was very clearly going in that direction

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,579
and there's main thing is we think back

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:15,399
so what the common experience of the log

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:16,930
was in 2003 we're starting to see kind

00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,670
of websites that were a little bit more

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,230
interactive if you went to this site you

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,970
can see would have all kinds of menus

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,589
that popped up and all that kind of

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,060
stuff I didn't pick this because I like

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,459
baseball by the way I picked it because

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,540
it's one of the few examples of the

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,570
thing I'm going to show you that I can

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,449
still find live on the web so it's nice

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,070
clean-looking website you know I

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:39,490
wondered how they made it so I want a

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,570
hit V source and that's all I could find

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,120
out about how operated this a one flash

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,010
40 and it's not that you know flash is

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,660
not a dominant and problematic force

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,020
right now it still is it's much bigger

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,690
than it was in 2003 but a one thing that

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,990
is different is people generally don't

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,490
try to build whole websites in flash and

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,990
whole sets of applications in flash in

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,819
the same way that things were going and

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:07,000
there were other technologies as well

00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:09,250
that we're taking away the ability of

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,920
people to see the source code of web

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,959
pages which was an incredible force in

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,480
terms of innovation and how the web

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,190
gruel and so you're getting to the point

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
where people couldn't study copy modify

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,449
will share the web or I couldn't see the

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,190
source code of a web page you couldn't

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,690
figure out how the web was operating and

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,490
there was a real risk of that and I

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:32,319
think that particular part of the risk

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:35,380
has diminished so the point of that is

00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:38,500
that freedoms matter they certainly

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,440
matter for software but I think not just

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,720
for software I think also for the web

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,640
they don't necessarily that framer isn't

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,100
necessary exactly Matt to why the web

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,110
has become more open but I think it has

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,240
a lot to do with it and I think the fact

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,760
that the software that runs the web and

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,350
now often the software that people use

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,120
to access the web is written by people

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,399
who believe in those rhythms has

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,430
something to do with how the world is

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,959
getting better and I guess you know

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,510
that's the question is is this enough of

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,160
a conceptual map I think quite naturally

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,779
it has become a part of the conceptual

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,040
map of the web being open and some

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,839
people can say well open web what the

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,329
hell's and open web we may don't have a

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,800
specific definition but I think it is an

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,230
important concept in it's something that

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,870
I'll see and will know around us and

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,250
maybe we need a more clear conceptual

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,149
map for that I think we've actually

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:31,839
gotten there in part because all those

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:33,760
so it's clear now the things are getting

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,350
a little bit better if you go I grabbed

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,870
this off Wikipedia but it's from

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,680
netapp's and you can see actually this

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,050
is definitely something I'll they have

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,300
internet will have dropped under seventy

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,839
percent for the first time ever since

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,460
its dominance in the last few months

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,890
Firefox is over twenty percent which is

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,510
great I guess what's more important is

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,790
the vision diversity of browsers in

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,670
there and that that's how the market has

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,170
moved and that there are people playing

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,120
in a way that is pushing innovation and

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,420
pushing standards and that's you know

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,180
that's a good thing I guess it another

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,010
way that things have gotten better and

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,580
is ways things that we take for granted

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,740
now right is that we're in a world where

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,930
the kind of configurability of how you

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,060
experience the web is really common and

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,130
common for mainstream users of the

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,260
internet who aren't programmers and so

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,420
you know Firefox add-ons is one example

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,040
WordPress plugins is another example but

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,570
you know there's lots of other things it

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,270
basically we're going to a point whether

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,160
the ethic of letting people bend and

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,320
manipulate and control their experience

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,870
I think comes from free software is

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,459
there in how we set things up for

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,670
mainstream users to access the web and

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:47,190
add-ons are big part of that and in some

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,200
ways I don't think people people may not

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,950
agree with this specific statement but

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,390
in a way letting giving consumers who

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,680
don't necessarily have those technical

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,990
skills the ability to control their

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,339
experience more brings them closer to

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,230
being able to hack that experience they

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,360
get more choice and freedom over what

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,400
the web feels like for them and that's

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,240
something which isn't just in Firefox

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,459
that's something that I think is

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,189
becoming the mainstream of how things

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,380
work and I think it's the mainstream of

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,620
kind of what people expect the web to

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,360
feel like in terms of content and so you

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,160
know obviously WordPress is something

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,819
that somebody with our lower technical

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,319
skills can do a lot to change because of

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,209
the plugins because of other things

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,670
Creative Commons licensing is quite

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,800
common now in terms of what the is free

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,900
content on the web Wikipedia obviously

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,330
is another example that an even thicker

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,840
which is a kind of close proprietary web

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,580
service is the biggest repository of

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,280
open photographs that has ever existed

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,410
and if you can clara all CC license

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,970
photographs on flickr i think it's like

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,490
over 20 million if you take away

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,960
noncommercial and attribution only and

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,690
just look at through licenses it's still

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,870
in the kind of

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,860
five to eight million range and so the

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,200
mass of consumers has come to expect and

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,059
is taking advantage of those freedoms

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,220
and variably to manipulate information

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:10,389
into some degree manipulate their

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,399
experience of the web so you know my

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,799
answer to the first question I used to

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:16,629
ask is how far can free open go and be

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,870
on software i think is far i think that

00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:21,759
the values the conceptual map that comes

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,820
over for freedom have really infected

00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:28,750
society through the success of free

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:33,070
software in the market so my second

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:37,269
question what's next not necessarily so

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,860
rosy let's look at 2009 can't totally

00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,509
predict the future we can some things

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,450
we're pretty sure going to happen some

00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:45,700
things you can guess about I guess

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,100
there's a european election this year we

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,899
hope the Guantanamo Bay gets shut down

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,639
this is the international year of

00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:52,929
natural fibers so happy to see

00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,629
everybody's wearing cotton or most

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,610
people growing cotton here in the room

00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:59,710
and there's a rumor on the smiths

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,009
reunion tour although it has been hard

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,710
to confirm but you can it is there

00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,210
somewhere on the web is longer and this

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,399
is really bad that this is cloth because

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,379
what it says at the bottom is 2000 i

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,059
think and i think it's it's almost

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,009
impossible that this wouldn't happen is

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,610
that this is a big year for free

00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:19,960
software and mobile it's certainly

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,370
something that Mozilla is interested in

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,039
but it's not a lot of people working on

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,570
for a long time and and a lot of things

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,350
happen in late two thousand eight or

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:33,039
just over the last five weeks so many

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:36,669
things further and I guess it's good

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,460
that two thousand i'll probably be a big

00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:42,220
deal for free software mobile I think

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,679
there's a bigger more epic battle will

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,230
about to enter into around mobile that

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,669
goes beyond just whether the software

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,780
that runs on your phone is free and oh

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:53,870
you know I have this lovely and

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,860
I've come to like and it's great but

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,910
there's a lot of things about it that

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,890
are still really really closed those

00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,230
things that make up the mobile ecosystem

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,730
we'll talk about in a second I mean that

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,010
we're essentially in a battle over

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,810
whether the mobile space and especially

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,990
mobile computing and the mobile web

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,350
mobile internet become more like this

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:18,020
telephone which as a single purpose is

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:21,140
incredibly prescribed I can't hack or

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,990
cat hack to do much and certainly is not

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,520
something that is sort of generative or

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,070
encourages new kinds of creative

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,620
innovative uses versus the computer

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,870
which is obviously done that and so we

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,090
have those two paradigms I think

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,160
fighting it out and ahead of us in terms

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,350
of where mobile is heading and given a

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,120
mess issue to put some laughs up here

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,220
that people have probably all seen about

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,920
what mobile growth looks like in the

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,480
world especially in emerging economies

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,160
but it's it's pretty clear like that's

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,410
where the action is right most people

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,660
are going to access data do the ranking

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,730
all the kinds of things that we do on

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,740
desktops or mobile I mean that I don't

00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,030
think that's even debatable it was

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,450
probably a good thing to argue about

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:05,150
over beer so question is how can open

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:08,750
win in this environment how does the

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:12,980
generative free computer hackable model

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,590
when in mobile and the thing is that

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,790
there's a lot of different factors so

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,950
we're probably going to figure out

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,650
hardware and obviously open mocos is

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,750
alluded in that space also in software

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,170
but that has such a pretty device I had

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,880
to use it as my Hardware picture you

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,770
know we've got to figure out free

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,770
software which I think a lot of progress

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:36,770
is being made and has been made on

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:39,350
Iranian mobile I figured the web and you

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,360
know this this is the loads of a fennec

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:45,860
which is the mobile Firefox product

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,049
that's in alpha now the thing about the

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,700
web is it really easily or think about

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,169
really easily can go back to where

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,299
computers were in the mid 80s where

00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:56,850
there are different applications written

00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,879
for each platform because the web sucks

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,559
so badly on mobile and we actually need

00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:03,509
to get to the point where the experience

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,919
of mobile on the web is the same as the

00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:06,690
experience of mobile on the desktop and

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,279
there's one unified web that moves

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,960
across all of our devices and we're not

00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,119
there and that's not actually

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,549
necessarily either in the interest of

00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,789
people who make popular mobile browsers

00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:19,259
like apple on the iPhone nor is it

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,389
necessarily where their focus their

00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,309
focus on making goo-goo mobile device

00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,840
and if you you know use all the kind of

00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:27,779
separate applications and not the web

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,730
who cares you know what we need to do is

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,639
make sure there is one unified web

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,509
across all platforms obviously the

00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:38,190
network needs to be open for mobile to

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:39,480
be something that actually works in the

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,539
way that we wanted to work it for the

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,129
telephone model not to emerge and you

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:46,830
know the kind of net neutrality Bates

00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:48,929
debates around thought the throttling

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,539
BitTorrent are nothing compared to how

00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:55,429
nasty mobile providers are in terms of

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,429
controlling what you do on their network

00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,480
so those are probably the obvious ones

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,919
other things that the other three things

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,230
I would think about is until we actually

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,639
figure out what we mean by an open cloud

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,909
I'll talk about the Franklin Street

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:10,529
statement later figuring out what

00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,440
openness means in mobile is going to be

00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,419
impossible because there's no question

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,489
like for me once I got this thing that

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,119
talks to the cloud really nicely from

00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:22,320
google but my computing has moved more

00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,269
into the cloud and there are problems

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,830
with that and dangers with that and lots

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,539
of things we haven't thought through and

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,179
until we think those through and the

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,679
technologies reflect that thinking open

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,679
and mobile are not going to go together

00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:40,259
pricing is also a huge issue right the

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,929
way that mobile carriers price network

00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,249
access basically limit certain kinds of

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,499
applications right you know whether

00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:49,619
that's bandwidth caps or just use aureus

00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:51,149
data charges or whatnot and you know the

00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,179
last thing that would need to be opened

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:56,309
out is permissions right here's a kind

00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,629
of everybody seen this poster especially

00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,350
if you live in North America which is a

00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:03,270
hellhole for mobile

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:06,990
you know a billion getting real locked

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,610
contract phone unlocked and you know the

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,220
fact that people get into contracts

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,049
where their device actually the petition

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,640
to do things with it like put a

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:17,520
different sim card and it is controlled

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,820
by here where is nuts and certainly is a

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,559
huge barrier to kind of an open mobile

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,370
ecosystem and if they do that even and

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,080
somebody can probably explain how this

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,210
works even with ambien and sealed iphone

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,490
certain kinds of applications are

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:36,120
difficult or impossible or unable to run

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:39,419
and so that's a lot of stuff to think

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,490
about if we care about ray will being

00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:44,159
free and open and I'll be care about the

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,690
fact the bat is a platform that in a

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,700
billions of people in the world are

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,460
going to experience there's your life

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,980
through and so I think you need to shoot

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,260
for it's a kind of Georgia knees kind of

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,750
thing as an open boat or Lucas open

00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,309
mobile ecosystem but doing that means

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,159
looking at all those things and it's

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:05,490
basically a spaghetti right it's not

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:12,600
that one we can read on for those things

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:14,730
and still lose and so my sense is the

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,409
foundations of thinking that through and

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,570
thinking through what we want to deal on

00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:23,070
start with this conceptual amount is

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,840
gotten the world a long way but I guess

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,120
the question is do we need more than

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,370
that conceptual map to move across all

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,870
of those things I don't know that this

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,940
conceptual map is going to help us

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,289
figure out maybe we'll how to disrupt

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,780
the mobile companies and get rid of

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:38,789
their pricing models I don't know

00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,770
certainly it's a part of the picture but

00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,840
I think as we look at that spaghetti we

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,150
need to start to think about what's next

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,110
and what else is on our conceptual map

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,340
in the future so you know the answer as

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,730
we move into trying to figure out this

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,740
space is you know we all know what extra

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,370
goes on the conceptual map but somebody

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,549
asks me the other day you know what does

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,250
it look like for kind of free software

00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:07,890
or open products to take twenty percent

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,600
of market share in mobile in the same

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,300
way that you know Firefox has been able

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,730
to do

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,530
web browsing I don't know and I don't

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,970
and I work with a lot of really really

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,070
smart people and Mozilla has hired some

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,870
amazing people new people who know the

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,900
mobile industry and I don't think we

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,900
know what all the pressure points are to

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,020
get past that close spaghetti system

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,930
right and you know the important thing

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,880
is to generously I'm just using mobile

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,460
as an example it's just the start we're

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,100
moving into a place where the more

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,200
complexity will be more forces trying to

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,570
stop the progress that free software

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,190
free culture who had and figuring the

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,160
matter is probably going to involve new

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,680
pieces of the map you know examples are

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,440
video where patents are clearly a part

00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,790
of the picture or where things are going

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,470
in the cloud and so on so you know I

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,360
think what we know at this point is

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,240
partly what I'm kind of calling out for

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,370
Heroes is help and fellow map makers we

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,830
know that to get it through spaces like

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,940
mobile we need better and in particular

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,280
bigger map so i don't know if people

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,050
familiar this kind of old map that you

00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,940
know those dragons over here on the side

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,100
of the sealer you know we don't know

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,540
where things are right you need to fill

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,600
in that part of the map and know that

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,760
those aren't dragons we need to move on

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:31,300
a bigger maps available on the edges of

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:32,860
what we can see right now so I think I'm

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,960
doing okay on time so I'm going to go

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,400
through my conclusion now for a little

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,160
bit and I guess that the first thing to

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,830
go back to my context is you know why

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,080
does Mozilla care why is this guy from

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,990
Mozilla up on the stage talking about

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,370
the future and talking about mobile and

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,860
you know talking about four freedoms

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,720
away it's going to go talking about maps

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,170
and in a partly that's just because it's

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,090
a kind of crap i'm interested in the

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,010
poly it is because we've got this

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,450
mission that 50 years from now i don't

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,550
know and i don't think most of people

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,200
around me know fully what it looks like

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,690
but i think we do have a set of values

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,920
and want to refine and evolve those

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:18,370
values that can get us those 50 years so

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,399
we need a better map to do this um

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,710
there's

00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,239
things that I think are on that map and

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,369
you know this is just me riffing and

00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:29,330
isn't any kind of thing that's been

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:32,629
thought through with a lot of people one

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,450
of them pretty clearly we need strong

00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:38,179
values and already have them don't

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,710
always agree in a group like this on

00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,149
exactly what they are betting we agreed

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,659
much more than we do with the rest of

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:46,429
the world and I think those values do

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,320
need to go beyond just code we need to

00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,809
figure out a framework where we can test

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,839
you know is that web service open is

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:55,609
that carrier I mean this drives me nuts

00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,320
oh you know these carriers and all these

00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:59,269
mobile people organize things like you

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,799
know the open mobile conference and it's

00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,690
all 80 of these people who are like

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,429
nasty nasty people who are closing

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,679
everything down so how do you have a

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,869
framework where you test whether what

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,359
they're claiming they're doing is open

00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:12,859
or free and we don't have that in some

00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,269
of the train we're going in so I think

00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:17,179
we need to know what those values are

00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:19,429
how they map onto new spaces I think

00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:22,969
obviously continuing to build great free

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:25,339
software is important but and I think in

00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,049
particular continuing to build great

00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:29,769
free software people love to use is

00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:32,210
important it's important that that

00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:34,460
impact of moving the market is something

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:38,779
that continues because it impacts even

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:40,159
the people who don't agree with us and I

00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,589
think it a third thing which has

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,190
happened really kind of actually is to

00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:48,769
empower users more to control their own

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,359
experience of computing and the web and

00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:53,809
all of those kind of things let them

00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:56,509
hack more when you think about building

00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:58,429
software to the point where anyone can

00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:00,499
bend anything we're really that

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,940
distinction disappears a little bit more

00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:04,429
and I think that's happening naturally

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,589
because I think the value the things

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,539
that people who build software build

00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:10,609
free software like in terms of being

00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,710
able to control it they start are

00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:15,559
starting to naturally filter into the

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:19,669
features that users get and that's a

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,899
good thing so those are some pretty

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,609
obvious things and this kind of

00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:24,859
summarize what I said you know we want

00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:26,749
to keep the four freedoms we want to

00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:28,570
make stuff that you know helps users

00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:31,899
hacks we want to keep building

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:34,269
free software so on and so forth what

00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:36,190
else I mean what-what can everybody hear

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,200
do those are pretty big conceptual

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,000
things and I think that you know the

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,480
thing you can do is pick one piece of

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,610
the map that interests you and go and

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,080
start building it figure out where your

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:52,059
future edge is in this space and for me

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,980
you know it's kind of pretty simple it

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:56,409
comes from my days at the the shuttle or

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,269
foundation is I'm really interested in

00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:00,279
figuring out the edges of the map about

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:02,169
how education and free software and open

00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,940
source connect and this is immediate

00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:07,179
happen yes yesterday there's Leslie all

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,320
pixelated upload a bunch of other cool

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:12,429
folks talking about how we actually get

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,200
participation in free software projects

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,330
built into the curriculum of university

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,070
so I don't know what that map looks like

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,990
I don't know exactly how that works but

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,330
it's an edge that I personally want to

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,860
push and actually this t-shirt is says

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,600
Cape Town declaration that Oregon the

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,309
back that's something that I worked on

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,419
with a bunch of people including jimmy

00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,250
wales when i was at charlotte worth

00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,419
which tries to explain a little bit of

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,889
the map in terms of where open education

00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,570
could go not so much in relation to free

00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:38,919
software and you can go and sign that

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,970
declaration and this group of people

00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,200
could probably double the number of

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,940
signatures so feel free to do so you

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,700
know another one else a one that I

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,779
admire I mentioned booth where is this

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,519
thing called the Franklin Street

00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,139
statement on freedom and network

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,740
services and there's something that

00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:58,870
Bradley and a bunch of other folks

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,669
put together basically trying to ask the

00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,470
soil question that I'm asking here is

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,870
beyond the Four Freedoms we're talking

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,299
about web services what's a framework we

00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,549
can use to say whether that thing is

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,169
free and I think it could go even

00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:13,000
further than a head but I think it's a

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:15,159
really good start to a piece of the map

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,620
that's super super critical so if you

00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,259
haven't read that you know search for it

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,779
now and go check it out I think you can

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:24,519
actually sign on to it but you know

00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:26,799
that's another example of a small thing

00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,649
you can do to start building out the map

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,070
and I guess you know really the purpose

00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:34,419
of this talk was too kind of probe

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,549
everybody

00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,440
in terms of being fellow mapmakers

00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:40,090
saying you know what else is on your map

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,080
