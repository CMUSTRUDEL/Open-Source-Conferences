	00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,610
I think we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,940
the people who wander in late are going

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,590
to miss

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:22,369
best talk of the day so let me begin by

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,900
introducing myself and laying out a

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,180
little bit of context of how we're going

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,669
to spend the next 45 minutes or so my

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,070
name is Max Spivak I work for red hat

00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:33,829
i'm also a fedora project contributor

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,329
there are certain points during my talk

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,460
today or I'm going to talk to you as a

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,200
fedora person and I will be standing as

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,430
such there are other times where I'm

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,190
going to talk to you as a red hat

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:46,100
employee and I will walk over here and

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,249
put my fedora on and then you will know

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:54,890
that I'm talking to you like a red hat

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:57,859
salesperson so i've been working at red

00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,249
hat for about four and a half years i

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,949
spent two of those years as the Fedora

00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:06,860
project leader so I took over that role

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,650
just before the release of Fedora five

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,300
and continued in that role until just

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,180
after the release of Fedora nine almost

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,820
exactly a year ago for the past year my

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,460
job has been to manage red hats global

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,790
community team so that's a team of

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,860
that's a team of people who participate

00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,570
to a solid except extent still in fedora

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,050
but also part of what the community team

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,770
in Red Hat tries to do is ensure that

00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:38,630
Fedora isn't the only example of red

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,700
hats commitment to open source so we

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,310
work in in other in other parts of the

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,900
company as well however this talk today

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:51,860
is about fedora and so that's what I'm

00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:54,140
going to focus on so let's let's lay out

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,180
a little bit of context because I found

00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,230
it interesting in enjoy Brock Meyers

00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,230
open suse speech an hour ago he put up a

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:06,290
slide that talked about some of the some

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,640
of these sort of large goals of the open

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,200
suse project right and one of those

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,580
goals that he said was to make the

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,680
easiest use desktop for anyone in Linux

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,090
right so the point I want to make here

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,620
is that there's a whole bunch of people

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,590
in the audience and if I were to ask

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,390
each and every one of you what you use a

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,040
linux distribution for or what you use

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,130
fedora for I'm going to get a lot of

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,890
different answers

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,270
okay that's fine because Fedora can

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,030
serve a lot of different roles right

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,950
maybe you're using it in your ISP as a

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,440
server farm maybe you're a university

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,680
that's basing your your custom

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,080
distribution of linux on fedora maybe

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,060
you're an animation studio that's using

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,990
fedora to make movies that make hundreds

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,930
and hundreds of millions of dollars

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:56,430
around the world but the the project

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,070
itself has to have a small set of goals

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,770
that define both what it is and what it

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,710
isn't so that as decisions get made and

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,780
as resources get prioritized you can

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,260
make progress toward those specific

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,100
things right and fedora I think is that

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,540
a point in its in its life well what is

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,580
important to it is increasing the size

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,750
of the open-source development community

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,940
around the world right we need distros

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,430
and we need companies that want to spend

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,100
a whole lot of money marketing Linux and

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,590
getting as many new users into linux as

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,420
possible right and I applaud folks like

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,600
a boon to that seem to have done a great

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,730
job with that right Fedora does not

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,370
compete directly in that space right I

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,840
want you guys to picture a big giant

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:52,350
reverse pyramid right that represents

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,610
sort of the potential population of the

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,490
open source community and at the very

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,520
top of that pyramid you've got a whole

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,320
bunch of basic users who are simply

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,880
consumers of a linux distribution it

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,330
doesn't matter which one it is right and

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,190
then of all of those users some

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,260
percentage and I would argue too that

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,020
it's a relatively high percentage right

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,060
if they run into a problem they're going

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,049
to go onto google or whatever and

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,150
they're going to and they're going to

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,049
search for their error message and

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,390
they're probably going to find some

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:25,490
answers and they're going to solve their

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:29,220
problem great until that moment in time

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,770
everything that user has done has made

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,410
their computing experience easier only

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,480
for that right there is a pretty big gap

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,780
in this pyramid to the next step down

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,990
which is the moment in time in which a

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,090
user takes an action that turns them

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,500
into a participant in a community right

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,450
and that that gap is where Fedora is

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,920
really trying to focus in my opinion

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,000
right now right there's other Fedora

00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,400
contributors here maybe they have

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,190
different ideas but I think that's kind

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,320
of where we're focusing so getting those

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,600
users who are solving problems for

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,910
themselves to do something as simple as

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,770
file a bug report or post a little

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,290
how-to of how they solve their problem

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,360
on a forum right the moment that action

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,970
gets taken all of a sudden a user has

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,910
become a participant and that is the big

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,430
gap that you have to achieve and from

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,590
there it becomes easier for people to go

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,120
from being a someone who files bugs to

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,160
someone who submits patches and someone

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,750
who submits patches to someone who wants

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,070
to maintain packages right and then

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,170
you've got people who are building

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,240
infrastructure writing new applications

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,400
developing new features right once you

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,020
make that first leap it becomes so much

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,470
easier to pull someone completely into

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,890
the open source ecosystem Fedora strives

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,680
to be the place where that kind of work

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,780
can happen and where people who want to

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,210
fully engage in the apprenticeship that

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,680
is open source development right can get

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,060
into a community that allows them to

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,460
succeed we'll talk about that a little

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,290
bit more in this presentation so I will

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,640
very quickly say when I introduce myself

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,490
you'll notice that nowhere in my

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,320
introduction did i say that i am a

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,450
incredibly smart technical person right

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,070
so if you got questions at any point in

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,570
this speech shout them out if its

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,580
technical question i'm probably going to

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,380
turn to a Tom Calloway here who's the

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,500
fedora engineering manager or one of the

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,150
crew and blue and let them answer your

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,650
question about exactly which kernel

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,570
driver does blah blah and blah blah but

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,520
but feel free to shout out any kind of

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,570
questions or comments at any point in

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,280
time for the rest of this talk I want to

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,430
break it down into four categories and

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,130
these four categories are ones that were

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,930
chosen carefully by our Fedora marketing

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,630
team okay and we call them the four

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,130
foundations of Fedora again I didn't

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,969
realize the room was as big as Wembley

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,559
Stadium but I've got some stickers

00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,879
Aaron if you want a fedora sticker you

00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,129
can come to the fedora booth and we'll

00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:01,969
give them to you they say on them

00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:05,069
freedom friends features and first yeah

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:06,599
those are the four foundations that we

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,369
believe represent kind of the core

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,259
philosophies that Fedora is built upon

00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:12,389
so I want to talk a little bit about

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,829
each of those four things kind of say

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,409
what it means to me and then give some

00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,719
examples of what's going on in fedora

00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:21,119
right now or recent achievements in

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,459
fedora that relate to those four buckets

00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:26,069
and hopefully you'll find it interesting

00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,509
and we'll go from there the first one

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,309
that I want to talk about is the freedom

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:35,669
foundation because I think that's the

00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:37,439
most important right we're all here

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,579
because we believe very passionately in

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,499
free software and fedoras commitment to

00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,559
free software I would argue to you is

00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:49,079
among the strongest of all of the Linux

00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,699
distributions that are out there and Red

00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:56,909
Hat's commitment to free software up

00:07:50,699 --> 00:08:01,079
hold on Red Hat's commitment to free

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:03,629
software is that Red Hat recognizes that

00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,349
it is building its business right around

00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,909
a giant community and if Red Hat wants

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,279
to be able to look people in the eye and

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:14,309
say we are the leader of free software

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,279
in the world then Red Hat has to make

00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:18,809
the commitment to ensure that its

00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,239
participation in the free software

00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:26,159
community is genuine and honest and

00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:27,989
strong so well briefly talk about

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,449
licenses and spot you can jump in

00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:33,300
anytime if I say something wrong Fedora

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,569
is very active in making sure that all

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,889
of the code that goes into its packet

00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:39,839
right all the packages that we put into

00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,849
the distro and all of the up streams

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,379
that are building new code or

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,639
contributing code to the distro we want

00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,079
to make sure that all the packages in

00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,829
fedora have a free software foundation

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,379
or OSI compliant license and and and

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:55,050
spot himself spends a large amount of

00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,180
time working with up streams that want

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,519
to get code into fedora or other distros

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,559
where there are licensing problems and

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,019
tracking those tracking down the

00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,769
copyright holder's helping them to

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,329
explain to them

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,540
where there might be problems in their

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:11,160
licenses and getting licenses changed so

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,999
that the free software Commons that

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,149
everybody can draw from is as large as

00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:19,769
possible that's all nice i'm not really

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,600
going to go into licensing too deeply

00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,929
here but i wanted to wanted to make it

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,629
clear to anybody who doesn't know that

00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,089
that fedora holds a very strong a very

00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,279
strong line about free software right

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,040
and we're very passionate about it the

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,999
more interesting aspect of this freedom

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,119
foundation with regards to the Fedora

00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:44,939
distro as I see it is the manner in

00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:47,850
which our community participates in

00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:50,309
building the distribution right if I had

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,110
stood up here three years ago and tried

00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,480
to give this talk it would have been

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,160
littered with a to-do list of all the

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,110
reasons and all of the places where the

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,089
Fedora distribution isn't as open and

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,689
isn't as community friendly as it needs

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:06,110
to be but today you know we can stand up

00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:09,449
in front of you and we can proudly state

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,100
that about two-thirds of all the

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:13,860
packages in the Fedora distribution are

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,889
maintained by people in our volunteer

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,509
community right anybody in the world can

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,449
be a maintainer or a co maintainer of

00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:26,879
any package in fedora all they have to

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,819
do is be able to step up and do the work

00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,899
required to maintain and on that package

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,399
and they can do it um what's also

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,470
interesting is that the release

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,360
engineering processes and the

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,269
infrastructure processes around Fedora

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,259
have been specifically architected over

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,929
the last couple of years and

00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:49,649
re-architected in order to make the

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:54,419
community the community engagement as

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:56,069
vibrant as possible right Fedora is the

00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,679
perfect example of a distribution that

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,470
eats all of its own dog food okay the

00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,499
the build system that we use to take our

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,499
code and and create source rpms and take

00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:10,290
the source rpms and create binary rpms

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:11,369
it's completely open sourced I guess you

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,529
know I guess Joe is kind of talking

00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:14,759
about the open suse build system a

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,890
little bit i'll talk about the fedora

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,690
one it's called coji it was written

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,820
in a conjunction with some red hat

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,100
employees and some community members we

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,630
took the good parts of the Red Hat build

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,950
system the stuff that was generic the

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,160
stuff that wasn't needed for red hat

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,530
enterprise linux we streamlined it we

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,970
worked on it with our community we added

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,500
features we built the new build system

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,620
than anybody in the Fedora community can

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,750
use it was so good in fact that the

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,600
circle goes around and round and red hat

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,690
is able to take the Fedora build system

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,790
that it helped invest in building and

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,010
over time right replace more and more

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,200
bits of the old crappy Red Hat

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,930
Enterprise Linux build system so the

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,060
ecosystem shows right you know fedora

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,770
fedora I got to go put my red hat on

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:07,080
again by investing in the Fedora

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,570
community and doing everything that we

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,040
can to put the ability to innovate into

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,540
the hands of the most passionate and

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,810
most educated people in the world who

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,200
care the most about it Red Hat gets more

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,520
efficiency in its own processes right

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,290
being a good citizen and a good

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,990
contributor to the open source community

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:30,720
repays red hat tenfold for its

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:32,970
contributions moving on from the build

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,250
system because urine van moylan is in

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,000
the room and I like to embarrass him is

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,290
the system by which we actually compose

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,110
the distribution right you got to take a

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,810
big pile of rpms and create some sort of

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,810
I so out of it that can do something and

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,990
again we see the openness of the

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,420
community really coming into play here

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,520
because the main the main the main

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,250
composed tool that Fedora uses something

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,020
called punji has a nice API or a punji

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,330
bungees great by the way simple

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,310
command-line you really almost don't

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,710
have to know anything in order to

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,750
successfully run it you just say build

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,790
me a distro and you give it a kickstart

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,450
file or a pile of packages and it'll go

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,310
ahead and do it and that's what the

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,470
Fedora release engineering team uses to

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,180
build all of the different versions of

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,980
Fedora that we released to the world but

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,290
it's got a really nice API on it and it

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,910
allows community guys like urine and a

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,030
group of people called the Fedora unity

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,780
project who want to build upon that work

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,910
right

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,740
to make a graphical interface on top of

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,330
it so someone who wants to just go

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,110
through a wizard and build their own

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,550
distribution can do it a guy named Bill

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,170
Nottingham one of the most senior

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,980
engineers at Red Hat and in the Fedora

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,930
project did a lot of work in taking all

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,270
of the logos and the trademark issues

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,860
right around fedora and getting all of

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,500
the trademark and logo stuff into one

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,810
package that can easily be removed and

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,250
replaced with a generic package so that

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,590
people who want to create downstream

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,350
derivatives of Fedora can do so as

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,270
trivially as possible right because all

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,400
of the tools to build the distribution

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,250
are open and because we've gone the

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,380
extra additional step of making it very

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,960
easy for people to rebrand and reuse the

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,570
distribution and remix it without having

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,790
to worry about legal and trademark

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,220
issues we see a very sort of vibrant

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,420
release engineering and kind of custom

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,220
custom custom engineering community sort

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:35,670
of building up within fedora right on

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:36,900
the enterprise side I'm Shadowman I'd

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,200
like to sell you ten billion dollars

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,030
worth of software on the enterprise side

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,840
we see a group of people inside of Red

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:49,170
Hat using these ideas right in a project

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,780
called thin crust that's sort of a Linux

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,580
appliance building tool I've now reached

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,290
the level of my technical knowledge

00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,570
about it but again ideas that are

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,210
happening in the community ideas that

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,180
came from the community that we

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,580
supported bringing value back to the

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:14,310
business which allows us to continue to

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,390
support the community so that's well

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:20,430
that's what I wanted to say about the

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:25,830
freedom point have one fourth done any

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:27,300
questions or comments anything anyone

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:32,480
want to add from the from the Fedora

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,480
world all right

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:43,180
alright the next of the four foundations

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,740
that I want to talk about is we talked

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,500
about freedom now I want to talk about

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,470
first and to me first represents

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,110
innovation okay and it is the goal of

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:56,740
red hat and the goal of Fedora to be the

00:15:53,110 --> 00:16:00,040
most innovative community in the open

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:04,839
source development world and we believe

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,670
that we believe that we are so this is

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,870
where is where this is the part of the

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,910
speech where I might need some help from

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,389
my friends I want to talk very briefly

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,060
at a relatively high level about some of

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,339
the technical advancements that are seen

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,920
all over the Fedora eco sorry all over

00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:22,660
the open source ecosystem that have come

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,029
from the Red Hat in fedora community

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,670
right the first one I want to talk about

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,350
is is a new X Server project called

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,810
Wayland right this is this is relatively

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,880
recent in the last or maybe nine months

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,470
or something like that you see a lot of

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,819
it in fedora 10 if you've used fedora 10

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,800
we've got a we've got a program in there

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,689
and it's when the when the operating

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,610
system starts up right right after you

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,529
see the the bios they used to be a

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,329
program called Red Hat graphical boot it

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,310
was the little fedora logo and it would

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:52,839
switch from all the different modes is

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,459
all your services start up it would run

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,040
down the whole thing that's the old

00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,660
world we replaced that in fedora 10 with

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,550
something called Plymouth right which

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,009
takes advantage of the kernel mode

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,260
setting feature that some of the some of

00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,429
the newer chips that's have and wayland

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,169
which is the x server that takes

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,089
advantage of this so that the entire

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,939
boot process now is significantly faster

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,360
more streamlined right there's a feature

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,459
in fedora 10 or door 10 and fedora 11

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,860
it's a continuing project through the

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,510
current two releases of speeding up the

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,970
boot cycle the goal i think for fedora

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,740
11 is to get a 20 second start up right

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,600
from turning on the power button to gdm

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,760
you're ready to log in everything you

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,960
need to go in 20 seconds all of the

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,510
development behind the scenes on Wayland

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,490
is going into that and and we're pretty

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,919
confident that that because we're doing

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,090
that development openly it's going to

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,370
it's going to be something that benefits

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,350
the entire the entire free soft

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,790
we're community right another thing that

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,740
red hat and Fedora have invested

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,750
significantly in is development around

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,140
the nuvo driver right the reverse

00:17:52,750 --> 00:18:01,870
engineering of the of the Nvidia the

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:04,500
nvidia 3d drivers and and again these

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:08,190
are these are developments happening in

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,320
the core functionality of Linux right X

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,170
or I guess to would it be fair to say

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,740
that it replaces X I don't know now

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:20,830
around X that are going to benefit the

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,960
entire community right Red Hat in fedora

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,090
leading the way here we think that's we

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,650
think that's a valuable thing to do the

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,410
other the other place that I think it's

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,270
a useful place to talk about because we

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,770
see it being used more and more in all

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,580
of the infrastructures that different

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,720
Linux distributions are rolling out is

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,460
virtualization right it's been it's been

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,290
a major well it's been it's been a major

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,510
thing for a long time ever since kind of

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,270
VMware got us going years and years ago

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,980
but the inevitability of open source

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,780
right always said that VMware's

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,690
proprietary model would eventually be

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,280
replaced by an open source community

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,309
which can do the same things better and

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,830
faster and for less money and here we

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,780
are in 2009 where we've got a

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,400
progression if you look in if you look

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,700
at the history of Fedora from fedora

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,040
core for all the way here to the alpha

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,500
of fedora 11 you've got a long

00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,030
progression of progress in the

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,010
virtualization space starting with the

00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:18,160
work that was done on then way back in

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,450
the day right but but let's the less

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,980
i'll be honest what's the what's the

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,760
leader in virtualization right now it's

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:29,920
kvm so so what is fedora what does the

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,230
Fedora model make possible in something

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,790
deeply technical like virtualization

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,940
where you've got different competing

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,710
solutions even within the open-source

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,450
ecosystem how does Fedora help if you

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,160
are a developer how does Fedora help you

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,290
make sense of what's going on here and

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,830
work with technology that changes very

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,690
quickly well Red Hat has invested a lot

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,610
of its own engineering resources and

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,860
built community around various

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,050
virtualization projects like libvirt

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,809
right which tries to consolidate a lot

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,100
of the a lot of the virtualization call

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,649
that need to be made into it into a

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,190
basic API a verte manager which begins

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:08,710
to give you a graphical interface to to

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,070
to use and manage different virtual

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:16,120
machines right and and and and moving on

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,370
even further in the recent history we're

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,320
starting to see in the Fedora project a

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,120
project called Fedora cumulus which

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,330
begins to take advantage of the

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,529
virtualization technology that exists

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,840
and build sort of an infrastructure

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:30,700
cloud which we're going to use both in

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,580
building the Fedora distro so we can

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,539
make it available to a huge community of

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,889
hundreds and hundreds of people who are

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,710
building thousands and thousands of

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:42,519
packages we can manage all of this stuff

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,830
and because it's been built with an

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,499
abstraction layer on top of it right

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,850
certain people go and use kvm we're

00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:50,379
capable of supporting that if certain

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,360
people go and use then we're capable of

00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:58,330
supporting that and I've got to put my

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,730
hat on the value for Shadow Man is that

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,850
you've got a huge community of

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,799
developers who are playing around with

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,960
these competing virtualization

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,539
technologies who are helping to ensure

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,169
that the manner in which Red Hat is

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:17,950
building ap is and general general means

00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,690
of using virtualization is sane and make

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,330
sense and can support something as

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,799
robust as the Fedora infrastructure so

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,570
that by the time we take all of this

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,519
virtualization technology and stick it

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,929
into red hat enterprise linux at which

00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,749
point in time we're committed to support

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,090
it for seven years we're so much further

00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,249
down the road of knowing that it's

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,659
stable that people want to use it that

00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:39,100
the engineers who work for our customers

00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,289
aren't going to look at their managers

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,730
and say we bought this crap right it's

00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:44,559
going to it's going to be something that

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,929
our customers are able to use and that

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,350
we're capable of supporting in the

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:52,269
Fedora space however what's exciting if

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,230
you're a developer is that you've got a

00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,669
six month release cycle right in the

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,990
United States last year you might have

00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,990
heard we had a presidential election

00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:07,509
over a billion dollars was spent by two

00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,860
guys campaigning over the course of I

00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,710
don't know it took him three years right

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,440
so that one person could get one person

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,830
could get elected president

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,859
in fedora we have a technical election

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,359
every six months right every time we

00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:26,529
throw out a new distribution of fedora

00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,450
everything is kind of up for grabs right

00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,190
and it's a chance to look around the

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,720
open source ecosystem and decide what

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,149
are the most compelling pieces of

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,820
software that sell various different

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:39,700
problems and pull them into the distro

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,859
right and the cost of doing this because

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,350
we allow the community to lead us and

00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,149
the developers to show us what is most

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,309
exciting what works well where is the

00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:51,869
mindshare going right because we allow

00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:56,799
the community to sort of be that massive

00:22:51,869 --> 00:23:02,919
electoral body the cost of developing an

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,480
enterprise linux distribution the cost

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,039
of developing an enterprise linux

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,919
distribution that anybody can use drops

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,700
very far right the price of failure is

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,559
lower and because of that the entire

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,090
open-source community because let's not

00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,169
forget there are derivative downstream

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,629
distributions of red hat enterprise

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:25,539
linux as well the entire open-source

00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:29,619
community gets access to enterprise

00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:32,049
quality software in theory and a price

00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:33,789
much lower than what it should cost

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:36,879
proprietary software companies to do the

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:39,759
same thing right and that that larger

00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:41,440
circle that isn't just red hat but it's

00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,690
the entire open-source community working

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,850
together because everything is GPL then

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,350
everything goes back upstream that gives

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,659
us the energy that we need right to

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,070
continue to to continue to threaten and

00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:57,070
push the proprietary companies out of

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,789
business hopefully well I could ramble I

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,629
could ramble on a little longer here but

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,639
instead i'm just going to name a couple

00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:05,259
of other projects right up streams that

00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,450
have been adopted across various linux

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:10,690
distributions that have been that have

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:14,679
been led by fedora and red hat to try to

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:18,039
underline the point that again our

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,169
ecosystem is trying to attract the

00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,700
developers who are interested in getting

00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,409
their hands dirty and doing all sorts of

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,020
new things right so you've got

00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,400
pulseaudio you've got network

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,710
integer you've got package kit you've

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,080
got d-bus you've got how which is now

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,880
being replaced by device kit these are

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,590
all these are all things that are way

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,940
over my head right but these are these

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,480
are these are these are fundamental

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,700
pieces of the Linux system where

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,320
innovative work is being done within the

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,210
Fedora community and where we're looking

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,460
for more and more developed to help us

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,330
to help us test things to help add

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,910
features to help to help really be a

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,550
part of it and cut their open source

00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,890
teeth in our ecosystem so that we can

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,800
all then go forth into whatever company

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,360
as we go to and and and b and b and b

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,700
more equipped to to split the

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,700
open-source message all right any

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,200
questions any questions that I say

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,420
anything wrong in the technical world

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,420
that anyone wants to wreck me yeah joe

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,010
well yeah

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:33,529
and I think yeah I was I was a little

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:37,100
careless with my words I suppose I think

00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:40,639
the goal I think the goal is to show

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,860
that the open source model is clearly

00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,480
superior right and that you will see as

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,129
new companies and new technical

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,370
companies begin they're going to say

00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:52,149
well it's blindingly obvious that

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,429
adopting an open source model and

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:57,559
investing in and joining the community

00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,690
that already exists is going to make us

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,190
so much more efficient that that sooner

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,330
or later guys that are graduating from

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,970
Harvard Business School are going to

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,129
assume yes you know I have to I have to

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,860
build my community an open-source way if

00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:11,090
I want to be relevant I think that's I

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:18,470
think that's a better way to phrase it

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:20,269
and again it's a good question and I

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,190
don't want to drag myself too far off on

00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:23,809
a tangent but a point that I did I used

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,360
to make in an older talk that I gave is

00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:29,749
that for a lot of us developers write

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,759
open source open source participation is

00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,590
a very philosophical choice right we

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,070
believe very deeply and free software

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:40,460
and that is why we do it but when we

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,070
talked to a when we talked to the the

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,629
guys that wear the suits and ties right

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,460
they understand that and they respect

00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,749
that and they appreciate that but we

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,999
also need to be able to show them that

00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,529
if they sound business investment right

00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:53,480
that they're going to make more money

00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:55,580
and their company is going to be more

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,529
successful if they embrace open source

00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,240
and that's part of what well that's part

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:03,909
of what the the Red Hat community team's

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,799
job is right within the fedora space

00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,659
we've got people who drink the kool-aid

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,649
and who believe it very passionately and

00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,360
they're going to participate because

00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:13,759
they it's in there it's in their blood

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,190
right and within the red head space

00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,480
we've got a lot of that too but we want

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,809
to make sure that we are consistently

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,190
reminding everybody within the company

00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:25,009
from the top all the way down to the

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,690
bottom that what makes us a special

00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,190
company and what makes any company

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,309
that's an open source company's special

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,720
is because not only do you acknowledge

00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:34,879
what open source communities can do for

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,679
you but that you buy in completely right

00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:38,269
and that you you don't you don't go

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,679
halfway right you don't just throw your

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,640
code up on a website and say well I

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,200
guess we're an open source

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,180
company right if you're not going to

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,320
build community around it if you're not

00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,490
going to actively manage those

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,590
communities and if you're not going to

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,980
try to allow those communities to

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,690
leverage to leverage the investments and

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,610
resources that that a company wants to

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,380
make then you might as well not do open

00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,110
source at all right I think it would be

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,760
better to go it's an all in or all out

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,500
proposition right either you got to be

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,270
an open source company and go all the

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,610
way or you should just not bother at all

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:10,790
if you go halfway I think you you give

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,380
up all benefits of you give up all the

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,420
benefits that in theory having

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,670
proprietary IP could give you and you

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:22,250
get none of the benefits that open

00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:24,200
source could give you so while I'm on

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,780
that while I'm on this this topic of

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,960
community I'll move to the to the third

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,410
of the four foundations that represents

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,420
fedora we talked about my mind is

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,950
jet-lagged we talked about freedom and

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,280
we talked about first now I want to talk

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:43,720
about friends because so many of my

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,720
friends are here in the audience right

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,830
this is the this is the less technical

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,480
part of the talk I already talked about

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,980
the I already talked about the fact that

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,340
about two-thirds of the packages in

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,220
fedora are maintained by our community I

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,870
want to talk briefly about a couple of

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,530
other pieces of the Fedora community

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:06,740
that I think provide the ecosystem

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,120
around the distro that folks might not

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,860
know about Joe did a little bit of this

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,170
in his talk as well because the distro

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,420
is great and it's critically important

00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,790
but the Fedora project is so much

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,330
greater than just the CD that you can go

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,490
get at our booth the Fedora

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,700
infrastructure team I think is a shining

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,670
star in our community right because it

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,400
embraces perfectly the community

00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,450
building tactics that we have tried to

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,550
that we have tried to perfect and

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,440
implement over the course the last few

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:39,530
years right it is almost entirely

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,740
volunteer driven and it is also entirely

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,960
open right every piece of software every

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,490
single piece of software that's used to

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,410
keep the Fedora project running is

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,820
completely open source we won't use

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,140
anything that's not open source we

00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,140
completely eat our own dog food

00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:59,130
we've got a system administration team

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,590
that basically follows the Sun right

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,460
you've got volunteers all over the world

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,990
who are part of the Fedora

00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,100
infrastructure team if a server goes

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,260
down in the middle of the night in the

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,750
United States in theory there ought to

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,040
be someone there ought to be someone

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,570
somewhere where it's daytime for them

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,090
who's going to be able to respond to

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,710
that message quickly and in theory no

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,100
one should have to wake up in the middle

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,420
of the night in America in fact our

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,150
infrastructure itself is co-located

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,160
around the world we've we've recently in

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:30,330
the last year or so built up a pretty

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,480
nice data center in Germany that that

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:37,679
that helps us make make us kind of fault

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,870
tolerant I suppose and the fedora

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,220
infrastructure project from the

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,950
perspective of someone who wants to

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,480
participate i think is an excellent

00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,820
place to get started because we've seen

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,570
some of our we've seen some some of our

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,970
recent success stories of really of

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,679
really brilliant new contributors to the

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,480
project come through the fedora

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,660
infrastructure team right there's a guy

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,130
named ricky jus who's uh who's now 18

00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,410
years old who started contributing to

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,790
fedora when he was 16 he came in through

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,190
the fedora websites in the Fedora

00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,559
infrastructure project he's just started

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,320
his first year of university and he's

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:18,390
one of the most important people in the

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,160
fedora infrastructure project and I know

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,710
there's their stories like that all over

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,890
the open source community but I think it

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,049
I think it really represents for any of

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,360
the people in the audience who are still

00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:33,090
in school and looking to get their first

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,290
job in open source or looking to looking

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,730
to make the first step of what's going

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,590
to be a long career in open source

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,630
software I think it shows how these

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,970
communities if they're built right and

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,740
if the leaders understand that they have

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,470
to think about building community and

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,290
not just doing things themselves it

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,299
shows the incredible potential for

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,799
someone at a young age who otherwise

00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,049
wouldn't be able to get an opportunity

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,320
in some you know a normal sort of

00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:00,690
corporate situation to build up such a

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,720
huge amount of experience and an

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,520
authority that when they're ready to get

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,450
their first full-time job there

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,490
going to be they're going to be gears

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,600
ahead of most of the other people that

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:16,430
they're competing for and I think and I

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:19,680
think that that doing that encourages

00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,240
such a positive feedback loop that it's

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,260
important that all communities work on

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,510
that because it will continue to

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:29,370
increase the size of the of the open

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:31,850
source workforce right the last thing I

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,650
want to mention on this sort of

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,300
education or young contributor point of

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:39,210
view is we have a project in fedora

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,590
called the fedora scholarship and we

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,690
give it out this is the second year that

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,990
we're giving it out and the application

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:48,990
deadline for it in fact is sometime next

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,240
week I think it's the 15th of februari

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,250
next friday i think is what it is if you

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,130
are if you are somebody or if you if you

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,410
know somebody who is very active in open

00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,920
source preferably very active in fedora

00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:04,430
but very active and open source who is

00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,010
starting their first year of university

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:11,550
later in 2009 so like the fall of two

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:13,170
thousand nine encourage them to go on to

00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:16,140
google and type fedora scholarship and

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,540
read about it because this is something

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,370
that we're going to do every year and we

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,710
want to we want to basically give an

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,790
incentive for people who are light at

00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,770
that point in time where they're going

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,270
to start their university career who

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,220
have shown interest in open source we

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,780
want to help them we want to help them

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,530
pay for their university bills and

00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,790
encourage them to stay in to stay in the

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,320
open source community as they go through

00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,250
university so I wanted to kind of make

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,120
that little make that little sales pitch

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:48,390
the last thing I want to talk about in

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,510
the Friends section of my of my talk

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:55,110
here is an area where I think Fedora

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,760
needs to use community to improve over

00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,070
the course of the fedora 11 and fedora

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,570
12 release cycles and it's one of the

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,040
it's one of the goals of Fedora all the

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,960
way from our Fedora project leader Paul

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,380
fields on down and that is to improve

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,080
the quality assurance portion of Fedora

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,600
right one of the one of these things

00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,540
that we have struggled with in fedora

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,650
over the last couple of years is this

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,290
challenge of getting stuff done

00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:23,050
versus building capacity that allows

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,940
more people to do stuff okay building

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,110
the capacity is fundamental to community

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,490
right you've got to build a

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,890
infrastructure in which people can

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,230
participate before the people can

00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,670
participate if you just have one person

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,440
trying to do the job all by themselves

00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,580
they're quickly going to get overwhelmed

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,990
their quickly going to burn out and they

00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,920
might be the most brilliant person in

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,240
the world and our and our QA people are

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,700
but they're going to reach a limit very

00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,130
quickly where they simply cannot they

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,780
simply cannot work 24-7 and get

00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:52,480
everything done that needs to be done so

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,070
in recent history I would argue to you

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,150
that Fedora has fallen into this trap

00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:00,700
over here right too much time needed to

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,560
get the basic QA for the distro done not

00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,780
enough time available to build a

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,270
community around fedora Qi it's improved

00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,530
right over the last year or so we've had

00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,520
some people that have stepped up and

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:16,060
rebuilt fedoras bug triage community

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,610
we've had a guy named James laska lead a

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,650
series of Fedora test days right that

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,900
have been very good we've had a

00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:25,690
basically an IRC Channel and a specific

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,070
topic for each for each of these these

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,190
days we've tested things like pie

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,740
kick-start the ext4 filesystem in fedora

00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,330
10 we tested all the full disk

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,280
encryption and its integration into the

00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,830
Fedora installer right so we've seen

00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,840
we've seen enough enough of the seed of

00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,340
the fact that with the right ideas and a

00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,130
little bit of time spent you can build a

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,700
community around QA and this past week

00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,170
is very wonderful for this project guy

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,140
named Adam Williamson who used to be

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,780
with manned Riva joined red hat and his

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,540
job is going to be to build community

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,120
around QA specifically in the fedora

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,910
space so that's another area critically

00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,960
important that there's a lot of

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:11,500
opportunity for participation so I

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,330
wanted to be sure to mention that the

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,730
last thing the last thing I want to talk

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,040
about is the last of the four

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,180
foundations is features so we've got

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,350
freedom we've got first representing our

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,730
innovation we've got friends

00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,680
representing our community and we've got

00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,140
features representing what on earth have

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,650
we actually produced for you and

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,410
yesterday I think it was yesterday

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,990
now thursday two days ago fedora 11

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,940
alpha was released and i want to quickly

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,190
run down some of the cool things that

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,490
are in it and then encourage you to go

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,770
and download it i mentioned this earlier

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,630
the the goal in fedora 11 of getting

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,120
startup time down to about 20 seconds

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,160
right the first cut of that that we

00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,740
started in fedora 10 continues in fedora

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,300
11 a lot of the way they're going about

00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,670
doing this is trying to identify the

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,140
places where where I oh really tends to

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,570
block during the boot process and

00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,920
eliminate that if you want to know more

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:09,020
ask spot again the first passive device

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,410
kit which as I understand it is sort of

00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:15,950
a a rewrite of how the hardware shop the

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:20,300
hardware abstraction layer is in fedora

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:23,480
11 ext4 right is replacing a xt3 in

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,190
fedora 11 a little cruft ii EXT for us

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,150
and better performance there's also

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,100
there's also the first parts of butter

00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,350
FS I guess that's how I say it I don't

00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,780
know how you people say it but if you

00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:39,350
want to try that that's starting to get

00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,740
ready in fedora 11 to feature that that

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,810
that I the feature that I like the most

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:49,160
is something that we call presto what it

00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:51,620
really means is delta rpms so let's say

00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,720
let's say Open Office for example

00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,000
releases an update and you gotta

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,600
download you run yum update you've got

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,280
to download some 20 megabyte RPM but the

00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,470
amount of code that actually changed in

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,360
that 20 megabyte RPM is only a few

00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,400
kilobytes because it was just say it was

00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,970
just one you know say it was just one

00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,520
security update the delta rpms feature

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,680
is going to make that possible so that

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,200
you don't have to download you know the

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,610
entire the entire new update and have

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,930
ninety percent of what you download be

00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,660
exactly the same bits that you already

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,060
have so if you have if your bandwidth

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,070
isn't great i think that's that's a

00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,570
really compelling future it also it just

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:34,190
feels more efficient that kind of like

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:37,340
that so there's also a lot of you guys i

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:40,610
know i discovered this a few years ago

00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,530
from the windows side there's a there's

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,880
a project called min GW right which

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,009
allows you to do cross

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,210
Eiling of applications so you can write

00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:48,680
your you can write your Linux

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,349
application or you can write your

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,720
application and see you can use GCC to

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:57,079
compile it for Linux and instead of

00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,640
having to rebuild it on a full Microsoft

00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,910
stack or something like that you can use

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,640
you can use min GW to build the Windows

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,009
executable of a free software

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,299
application that you've written

00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:10,490
completely in your Linux system so if

00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:12,859
you're if you're an engineer who has to

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,779
do who has to build applications that

00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:17,059
run on multiple platforms here's a way

00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:19,390
to do it without having to spin up an

00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:22,460
entire an entire Microsoft stack

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:28,130
paysanne to dot 6 is in fedora 11 as

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:31,609
well as genome to 26 KDE 4.2 and xfce

00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:34,609
4.6 the KDE and xfce are release

00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:36,319
candidate or beta is right now but we're

00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:38,750
also still a few months out from fedora

00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:42,500
11 final so all those projects will

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:46,130
continue will continue to mature over

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:52,660
time in conclusion well before I

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:52,660
conclude are there any questions yeah

00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh

00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:03,570
I can't hear that's why I'm walking

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,570
toward you not to throttle you yeah

00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,560
thanks one of the questions I have is

00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,630
what you guys are doing specifically

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,240
around KDE in the class you know Katie

00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,940
35 and KDE 4 series because with

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,740
opensuse we've had a large number of KDE

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,080
users who want to stick with three we've

00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,550
had a large number who want to be on the

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,380
you know the cutting edge so I'm curious

00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,090
what fedoras doing to solve that or

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,350
where I guess going for them spot you

00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,460
want that can you answer that you

00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,460
probably can answer that better than me

00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,620
we have no intentions to going backwards

00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,560
and providing the three environment from

00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,330
a compatibility perspective because we

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,000
feel strongly that at this point for

00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,700
that too is reasonably feature

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,610
comparable with the three to five series

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,220
and where there are gaps we'd much

00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,950
rather encourage contribution to fix

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:03,150
those gaps then have people just stay

00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,150
stagnant on the old stuff

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:32,809
Yeah Yeah right right right cool well

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:38,150
thank you Michael teman who basically

00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:40,650
created Cygnus is here somewhere so yeah

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,329
it's good so I'm going to wrap it up i'm

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:46,079
almost out oh yes you go that all right

00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:49,319
you talked about zen and kvm earlier on

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,549
yeah some of us who are dealing with

00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:54,990
virtualized environments up preferably I

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:58,890
would like to have a common environment

00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:02,700
for instance Sun in solaris goes with

00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:06,270
Zen to a certain degree in parallel to

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:09,450
so large containers so the question is

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:12,569
is red hat and Fedora going to support

00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:15,539
Zen in the future or are GU going with

00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:18,900
kvm own right well well let's be very

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,579
clear Red Hat already supports then in

00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,740
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is

00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,619
therefore committed to supporting it

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,329
until the end of life of Red Hat

00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:33,150
Enterprise Linux which is seven years or

00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:35,010
whatever Fedora never makes a commitment

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,010
to support anything for longer than 13

00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,299
months right this is part of fedoras

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,130
value proposition right we believe we

00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:43,230
can be innovative because we don't have

00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:49,170
a large legacy set of stuff that we have

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:50,880
to support so Shadowman shadow man says

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,740
I would encourage you to give me as much

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,630
money as you possibly can to support

00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,329
then because I will do it for you I will

00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,500
sell you all the Zen support you like

00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:59,940
Fedora says we're going to take

00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,640
advantage of the fact that we've got

00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,809
vert manager and libvirt and API is that

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,240
allow us to switch out the

00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:07,529
virtualization from then to kvm or

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,630
anything else that we want underneath

00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:11,309
and the user never has to know about it

00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:14,940
I Fedora is going to continue to do the

00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:19,529
best of what exists today so that's all

00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:21,710
I got for you all right i am out of time

00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:23,720
now so let me quickly say

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,550
let me quickly say a few words about our

00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,980
Fedora community in Europe because it

00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:32,599
rocks if Joe no bacon were here he would

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:36,170
say it's metal we got a great group of

00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,390
guys here and girls that that keep

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:42,440
Fedora running that operate all of the

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:45,530
major events and the next big place that

00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,990
Fedora is going to be is going to be at

00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,720
Linux tog in Berlin in June we are going

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,580
to hold our annual European flood con

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,920
there it will be in conjunction with

00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,230
Linux hog it's basically going to be the

00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,170
biggest Fedora event of the year in

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:04,070
Europe and I would encourage all of you

00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:06,410
to come to Linux dog there you go if you

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,030
wanted if you want to if you want to

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,339
join our community we would love to have

00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,990
you feel free to come by our booth feel

00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:14,720
free to if you're ready to become a
