hello so I'm going to start with my talk

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,730
about some mirrors about content

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:32,009
delivery networks and about delivering

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:34,950
free software my name is Peter and if

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,520
you haven't heard CDN before CDN is

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,969
short for content delivery networks

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:47,640
networks that are specialized for

00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:52,860
pushing stuff to users who want to get

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:56,180
it I don't want to bore you with

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:01,620
technical details about all this today I

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:04,890
rather want to share my vision I have a

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,790
vision for the future how to improve on

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,960
these things and this I want to share

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,650
with you and I hope you find it

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,439
interesting and maybe we can stimulate

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:27,030
some things that we can do together

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:31,200
later so what is it about so if you look

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,460
at the world of free software projects

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,009
then there are many many projects that

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,920
have stuff that they do for users and

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,380
give to them and their larger ones and

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:51,329
smaller ones and all these share the

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,659
same challenge some some of these

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,229
projects provide content that is really

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,420
huge like CD images or largest software

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,159
packages like open office while other

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,740
other of these content providers provide

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,289
smaller bits that are less problematic

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,230
but may also have be highly popular and

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:16,569
mirrored around the world like

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,569
the Linux kernel for example and

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:28,549
solutions to get this stuff to users

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:31,750
exists in three forms the content

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:36,739
delivery network could be either

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:38,150
commercial one that commercial content

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:43,840
delivery networks are really specialized

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:47,000
in that like Akamai or YouTube they are

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,980
they would be very nice to use for open

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,829
source software projects but they are

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,500
really expensive they do what they do

00:02:51,829 --> 00:03:00,379
well and it's so you don't have to pay

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:04,549
for it a lot the second type of content

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:07,160
delivery networks is things that the

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,519
academic world came up with during the

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,879
last 10 20 years there are some

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,280
approaches that are highly interesting

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,010
but they're never they never reach the

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:25,630
production stage often they are they are

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,630
too complex to really be implemented and

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,120
often they have for example features

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:35,090
like bandwidth and latency measurements

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,370
between users and you might need two

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,280
nodes around the world for that to do

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,810
these measurements and client feedback

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,209
has to be provided to some servers and

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,230
this is hard to implement because then

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,480
it doesn't work with a normal web

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,280
browser for example and you need

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,239
infrastructure real machines that are

00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:04,060
placed somewhere that do this work so

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:07,879
the academic approaches are sometimes

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,840
it's nice to read on them but only few

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:15,729
of them are really in use only one

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,979
actually and the third approach which is

00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:21,500
very popular and popular and also very

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:24,680
traditional is to use mirrors mirrors

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,490
our server machines country

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,910
or provided by universities mostly by

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:37,940
ISPs or also by private persons so you

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:43,100
download stuff from a mirror and there

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:51,070
are about let's say 300 mirrors around

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:51,070
the world which provide this service and

00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:01,070
many of them you know well because you

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:03,710
come back to them again and again so how

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:12,349
do we deal with these mirrors how is

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:18,169
this organized let's go to some examples

00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:21,860
i have put some logos here of some

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:26,000
approaches for this task these are the

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,009
commercial guys Akamai used by Apple

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,710
Microsoft novelle to provide their

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:35,150
software updates limelight is actually

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:38,630
providing youtube for example then you

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:44,330
all know sourceforge sourceforge has a

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:47,780
humorous but very large ones they have a

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:54,470
web front-end approach to for users to

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,729
get to this to the stuff and another

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:02,360
approach is the mural manager of fedora

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:08,270
which has again a slightly different

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:12,020
approach it is not working on fire level

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:15,199
it's working on directory level so it

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,530
doesn't know exactly if particular file

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,430
is on amoureux but it has some kind of

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:27,320
state database which knows roughly what

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:30,770
mirrors do have there is a bouncer

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,650
bouncer is used by marcella and by open

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,230
office there are actually two versions

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,350
of bouncer

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:42,830
one of them does not actually one of

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,800
them is able to distribute client

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:51,230
requests on geographic basis to mirrors

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,630
in the in that region which fedora also

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,360
does they didn't mention that so that's

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,930
probably something that you always want

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,870
to do because connections to close and

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,240
close the mirrors are always work baton

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,610
or typically work but um there's another

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,190
bouncer version that does not support

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,190
this which isn't used by open office

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:22,570
there is the DB on style approach which

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:26,420
basically just does a schematic

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:34,160
assignment of mirrors on a country and

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:39,740
DNS round-robin base there is Man River

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:48,370
approach which he knows much better than

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:51,260
me and we have Micro probably but down

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,720
yeah freshly attracted well I

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,870
implemented the juicing meta links

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,030
between still do but we had date on

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,140
server side where it generated metal

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,030
links based on the coordinates latitude

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,850
and longitude and calculated the

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,480
distance to the nearest mirrors which

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:15,190
would be done on server side but he

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:19,820
would require a lot more so then we

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:23,060
switch to doing it by based on on the

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,950
user's time zone and course coordinates

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,250
there on the users as of now it's just

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,050
generates make links locally and

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,290
automatically picks mirrors which it

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,990
features from the river middle east

00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:39,170
which is updated to the renowned them oh

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,240
yeah that's about it that's a very

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,080
advanced the very nice system actually

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,260
especially the new

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,260
especially the new metallic generation

00:08:50,480 --> 00:09:01,400
switch this off the geographic

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,400
coordinates do you get them from gip or

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:12,120
okay okay so you know okay so the client

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,980
provides info to the server and the

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:35,430
server decides where to send it ah no

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:37,200
longer okay it does provide the time

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,070
zone to the server yes that's what I

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,760
mean yup ya know so the client provides

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:52,650
some info to the server which allows it

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:55,440
to select more on hmm yeah so this also

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,040
means or implies that the cipro this

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,070
approach requires a specialized client

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:06,600
so he couldn't use it with W get or

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,150
normal web browser I mean web browsers

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,270
send something like language header so

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:16,190
if you go to site then it can decide on

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,190
that but sometimes that's wrong

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,910
anyway not let's not to talk too much

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,950
mod metal links and I will focus for a

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:42,060
moment on the comparison of these

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:45,020
approaches again Merle brain is what

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,030
Souza came up with two years ago and

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:51,480
what is developed still develop since

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,580
then it is an approach that does not

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,140
require a specialized client but it can

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,290
work with specialized specialized

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,090
clients to do a more advanced Bureau

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:06,090
selection and as I said I don't want to

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,630
bore you with technical details but two

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,050
other approaches that are bit similar is

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:16,680
these are those academic guys who are

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:19,350
corralled CDN is actually highly

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,730
interesting and it's working to some

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:27,540
extent but it has the disadvantage that

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,700
it requires the requires you to use

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,360
different URLs you have to prefix some

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,190
other hostname to get something from the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:41,010
network so it again it's not transparent

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:44,790
to plain HTTP FTP protocol that many

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:50,910
clients views codeine is the only

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:53,190
candidate that might maybe reach more

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,360
popularity in the future it is in some

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:59,820
production use actually know a few

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,580
mirrors that take part in it and use it

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,950
for some specialized or for some things

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,760
like a new at us American mirror

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:14,730
delivering stuff to Singapore I think he

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,080
has using that and find it works well so

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,050
all these a little bit different from

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,810
each other and may require a client that

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,560
is specialized or not it's one of the

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,560
differences and

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:37,639
yeah if you look at this picture this is

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,800
what I see when I look at the mirror

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,470
framework landscape there are lots of

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,160
different frameworks and they are

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:52,290
separate and apart from those I just

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,660
showed you the few there are many many

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,620
others like apache software foundation

00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:02,459
has a quite simple redirector that we

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:06,600
can choose murrow's manually and many

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:11,639
other software content providers do have

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,870
some very small solution and so the need

00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:23,850
is there and everyone tries to solve it

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:25,740
in a simple way and I will talk in a few

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,860
minutes I will talk a bit more why it

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,629
isn't isn't so simple to to do it in a

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,980
simple way it's quite a challenge

00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:38,309
actually to assign clients to a good

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,670
mirror and also to provide the client

00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:47,939
way to fall back to another mirror and

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:49,620
so on these things are called cans I

00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:53,069
don't know if you know the word if you

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:59,189
go for hiking in english-speaking

00:13:53,069 --> 00:14:01,559
countries then you often see them they

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:06,079
actually useful they can show the way

00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:13,819
you can mark a path and see where you go

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:17,459
but this is not so not leading anywhere

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:27,230
so what we rather should have something

00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:27,230
like this this is a roof of a church and

00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:39,509
it's building that has been built by

00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:50,309
collaboration and cooperation so how do

00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:52,230
we get from here to there we need or I

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:54,389
think we really should do should

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:59,100
introduce more collaboration on these

00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:01,829
things and what often happens what you

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,199
often see happening is that communities

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,939
are separate like these like the boys

00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:10,889
and the girls they don't talk to each

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:14,429
other they heard of each other and it

00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,100
also is you can also see this and open

00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:19,170
source communities like you care about

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,819
your vicinity but you don't really know

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,470
what the others do and there's a lot to

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,970
learn from each other and they have

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:32,309
something that they don't have and vice

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:34,290
versa so I already mentioned that it's

00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:37,919
not so easy as it might look at first

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:42,089
with dealing with mirrors and I will

00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:45,839
give you some reasons for I will

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:51,059
describe some reasons why is this rice

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:56,339
is not easy and i'm going to show you on

00:15:51,059 --> 00:16:00,209
a little example the example is picking

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,819
mushrooms and then deciding which ones

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,160
you want to eat because if you ever did

00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:09,569
that then you know you look into books

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,189
internet each mushroom might be growing

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,589
together with others that are not the

00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:15,869
same type and you have to look at each

00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:22,309
one carefully and on it's quite a

00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:25,290
complicated business and so let's try to

00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:29,699
explain how the selection of mirrors can

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,679
be done on this background so first

00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,319
question would be does the mirror have

00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,899
the file in question so we need to scan

00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,100
the mirrors

00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,810
which can be done from a central

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,019
location the mirrors is not mirrors

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,579
don't have to have some software on it

00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,459
because they already provide the content

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:52,470
like HTTP FTP are things so we can look

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:54,930
at them another question would be is the

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,230
mirror closed or the mirrors in question

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:02,699
are they close to the client so they

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:05,909
could provide good service might the

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:08,429
mirror be trusted no mirrors are never

00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:12,449
trust able because they could always be

00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:15,990
a hacked or broken or could be broken

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:20,689
firewall in between and could deliver

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:23,579
garbage or actually manipulated stuff so

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,010
it is very useful if you can sign your

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,289
content and actually provide the

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,740
signatures or verification hashes

00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:33,840
together with the content or for some

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,400
files it just makes sense may make sense

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,899
to just do it yourself and just send the

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,179
file yourself if it's not a large file

00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,919
then that's fine for example all the

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,350
signature files on your file tree you

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,220
can just deliver yourself they may not

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:57,720
be even larger at all than an HTTP

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:59,789
redirect which is also 1500 bytes there

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,289
may be private mirrors primeros marked

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:08,610
as private that are only meant for used

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:13,380
by to be used by limited group of

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:15,390
network lines boroughs and can have very

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,870
different performance a big ones better

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:22,559
ones and you have to pre or prioritize

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:29,280
on them and try to achieve a load

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:32,659
balance between them for the larger

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,169
files you may actually want to verify if

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:41,909
the server is actually able to deliver

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:43,700
that correctly that's about twenty

00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:47,970
percent of mirrors can't do that either

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:57,000
on ftp or HTTP they are broken this

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:59,340
regard many mirrors are useful but if

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,140
they have to provide DVD images and

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,890
extremely large content then they just

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:09,149
go down to their knees so it may be

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:12,149
useful to exclude them for by delivery

00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:14,280
and then you have to monitor the morose

00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:17,130
if they are actually available because

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,490
they're ours have to be rebooted they

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,700
die for various reasons and you have to

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,899
monitor them quite closely and no longer

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,899
send clients there if there are problems

00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:33,870
clients may actually send along with a

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,659
request some preference and you might

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:40,110
have to you might want to respect that

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:42,059
and because sometimes the client just

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,280
knows better what's good for him what

00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:51,020
works for him so it would be good to

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:53,700
have provision for that and finally you

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,740
cannot just go ahead and choose one

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,210
mirror because this mirror might just

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,480
not be available or it might not have

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:04,830
the file and then you you more or less

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:09,690
have a sorted list of better better not

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:16,429
so good morose and you can give

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:16,429
fallbacks to the clients and yeah

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:24,650
so these are some these were some things

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,480
that make me row selection they're not

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,640
so easy task and it's not something that

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,049
you implement in in a day and actually

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,299
all those most of those problems

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:38,360
problems you don't even you're not even

00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:42,440
aware of them if you start I certainly

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,260
wasn't when I started and it's you'd

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,179
rather learn about this problem during

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:52,250
the deployment and development and you

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:59,419
start to collect experience and there at

00:20:52,250 --> 00:21:02,510
the different use cases so this all I

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:07,370
believe dissolved in the boro brain

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:09,650
infrastructure and I also believe that

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,470
is solved in a way that is that would be

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:35,450
very useful for other content providers

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:39,620
to use and I lost track okay um after

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:42,980
talking about the server side for so

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,919
long might be useful to talk about the

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:52,250
client side the other end for few slides

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:54,740
and you all know classic HTTP and ftp

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,110
clients and web browsers but you may

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,270
also have heard of metal inc clients

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:06,160
meddling clients are specialized

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:12,140
download clients that combine combine

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:15,520
FTP HTTP and also be tolerant into a

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,970
powerful download client that can work

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,970
intelligently and

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:26,150
fail over and if it encounters errors

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,480
and problems connection problems or

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,580
broken content it can verify this and it

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,419
can actually continue downloading from

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:37,730
elsewhere these clients also can

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:39,700
download in parallel so they can try to

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,730
max out on your internet connection and

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:48,830
get content faster at these clients are

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:52,010
I let's call them intelligent and meet

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,900
our links the me telling client need

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:58,159
information to do this job and this job

00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:02,350
is provided to them by what's called

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:07,549
meter links and so called meter link is

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:09,919
it's just a mirror list mirrorless in

00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:18,049
XML formatted so it's machine readable

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:20,150
and it is also it also contain includes

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:24,380
it can include hashes and signatures for

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:27,440
the files so the client has all that it

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,679
needs to successfully download the file

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,120
from somewhere so what really happens is

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,230
a knowledge transfer from the server who

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:44,480
knows the mirrors to the client who

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:49,179
wants to use them and this looks pretty

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:55,520
well and I have a nice quote on that

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:59,809
from Andy the guy who invented the meter

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,080
links which I was delighted to read from

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:05,860
him and actually this combination is

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,210
really a powerful combination because

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,190
this is what really makes things work

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,200
you can have the best server and

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,520
database and Merle database and Merle

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,159
scanning and everything a mirror

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,130
selection in the world but as long as

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:23,150
the client it's just a stupid ftp client

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:25,850
it will just or HTTP client it will just

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,370
follow redirect that you suggest to him

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:31,399
and then it will either work or will not

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,259
work and whenever

00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:36,710
you want to implement some we're going

00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:39,049
to have something like try again or try

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,159
another mirror then you have to have

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:48,019
some something on top of HTTP and ftp

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:55,460
and this is what metal links do so back

00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:59,649
to the larger picture if you look at the

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:03,769
world map then there are quite some

00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:05,960
countries and regions that are far apart

00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,969
and there was a different part of the

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:15,169
world with a lot of internet connection

00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:17,359
and less internet connection and looking

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:20,210
at this man at this map I can give you

00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,039
some more reasons to believe me that

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,979
it's not not easy to select mirrors

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:29,779
because it's you want to you want to

00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:32,929
assign a mirror that is close to client

00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,729
but often this doesn't work by just

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:38,210
measuring the distance because the

00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:41,809
network topology looks extremely

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,839
different from this and I will show you

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:49,399
a few examples first example is new

00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:57,129
zealand new zealand is ok it's quite a

00:25:49,399 --> 00:26:01,009
simple case it has a edge localization

00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:04,759
quiet day at the end and simple to see

00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:06,739
that they have proper connection over

00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:10,249
their productivity but to the rest of

00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:12,409
the world as much worse and they also

00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:18,499
have some connectivity to the west coast

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:20,479
of the US i have heard but i have heard

00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:23,089
this from someone but actually don't

00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:25,460
know this is one of the problems so why

00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:27,799
this new zealand case is pretty obvious

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,359
they're also still some things that you

00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:35,059
need to find out so anyway it's a good

00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,649
rule of thumb to just send clients from

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,409
new zealand to an australian me wrong

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:41,080
but if they are know that if there is no

00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,820
Scalia mirror then

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:49,000
you already have to decide which one is

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:52,390
next and the chances are that these are

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,270
not good because they don't have much

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,800
interconnectivity often

00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:00,390
interconnectivity to the Internet

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,750
centers of the world is much better then

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:08,590
from here to there because especially in

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:11,410
Africa often people are connected with

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,640
satellite links that go to where they

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,640
want to go not to their neighbors

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:24,480
another interesting case is Russia

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:28,720
Russia is an extremely large country and

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,490
I know from a lot of feedback I got that

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:39,000
yeah I learned a few things i learned

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:42,550
that China Russia doesn't work this

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,720
continent called Asia would be in the

00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:52,180
normal unit of geographical thinking

00:27:48,720 --> 00:28:00,010
when you use certain library geoip for

00:27:52,180 --> 00:28:02,410
looking up client the look if you locate

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:06,790
a client and look look up its where it

00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:10,150
is and in this case Asia as a unit

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,580
doesn't work well because there is not

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:16,930
good connectivity between those large

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:23,350
parts and other special things about

00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:26,170
Russia are that for example I know can't

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,890
get to this mirrors that are here maybe

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:32,980
for political reasons I'm not sure

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:35,170
Russian users have very bad quantity to

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,960
other Asian mirrors which immediately

00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:41,470
are quite far away Russian mirrors have

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:45,070
good connectivity to German mirrors so

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:47,410
you have to really have to some special

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,380
cases and handle certain countries

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,010
especially so that never assigned to

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,870
their from crying about assigned to

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,390
always the central Germany or something

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:01,530
like that it makes it rather interesting

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,870
and any any simple scheme will not work

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,930
for all the countries and for very long

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:09,300
as soon as you start to learn about all

00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:13,290
these particular cases then it becomes

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:17,490
quite complex another interesting case

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:22,050
is South Africa where basically South

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,140
Africa the tip of Africa has like I know

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,810
five boroughs there and the rest of

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,920
africa is none so it's really quite

00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:37,040
concentrated here and the neighboring

00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:40,530
countries actually have decent

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:46,370
connectivity to South Africa from what

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:48,870
I've heard but Mozambique for example

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,880
doesn't get good connectivity South

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,280
African burrows so Mozambique is better

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,590
assigned to German morose again because

00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:03,330
satellite the national link goes down so

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:10,860
this is another interesting exception or

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:13,800
regional original particularity if you

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,550
think about Internet connectivity then I

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,760
think for most people in this room it

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:25,260
more or less looks like this like a

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:27,570
high-speed motorway but often we are not

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:36,170
aware that for other people it may look

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:39,750
completely different so there is a large

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:43,800
part in the world where many people live

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:47,000
more than in the well-educated rich and

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:52,500
well-connected countries that don't have

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,560
connectivity as good as this so a child

00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:05,070
and Africa may not have the opportunity

00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:06,220
to learn to be educated but educational

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,900
information

00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:14,280
p for being healthy and living a healthy

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:18,070
life and finding a job and so on and

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:21,159
people in less well connected areas also

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,510
need to download stuff simple simple

00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,270
reasons they need to download software

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,520
like open office open offices so it's

00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,919
quiet place quite a role in this because

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,299
it's free so a soft office production

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:37,840
suite and its really needed in people

00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:41,400
for people around the world and it's

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,500
also why it's so popular and people have

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,169
big problems to download openoffice

00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,880
because it's about a 100 megabyte

00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:54,789
download a bit more and that can can be

00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,900
very hard to download I have to close

00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:02,530
here from I quoted them from memory but

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:08,799
this is what some people said who are

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:12,190
affected by this situation so I believe

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:18,640
that muro selection that helps them

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:21,010
would be very worthwhile if you look at

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,440
the percentage of people in the world

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,049
who have internet access that's twenty

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,610
two percent so there's four fifth of the

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:33,460
world doesn't happen in excess at all

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:37,299
and of these people who have internet

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,220
connectivity at all I have some numbers

00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:43,539
here about the percentage of those who

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:46,120
have broadband connection like this air

00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:49,179
something fast so in Germany it's about

00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,870
twenty four percent Korea it's eight

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:54,340
percent this slovak republic is six

00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,000
percent only which is amazing because

00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,100
it's in the middle of Europe and in the

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,780
poorer countries it ranges between one

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:06,870
and three percent so there's a lot of

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:13,330
there are a lot of users who have only

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:16,080
bad connectivity no no broadband so we

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,080
can help them a lot

00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:25,870
so the question back to the question how

00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:31,150
do we get from the unorganized chaotic

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,150
separate solutions to the big solution

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:47,660
this is practically how I see the

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,179
mirrors organized it's just that they

00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:54,290
are not well organized not as clear as

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:58,460
here but it's a little loose

00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:03,350
organization the thing is that the

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:05,059
mirrors those guys they are the same for

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,030
fedora for you going to for openoffice

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:12,020
for Susan and so on you always meet the

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:14,510
same guys again so any of these mirrors

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,820
a lot of projects so what the user sees

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,440
is mirror or what you think about is

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,520
this mirror that mirror but actually

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,280
this machine mirrors several projects

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,710
this one actually the same and this is

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,840
very similar it's just not file tree

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,869
different layouts different sometimes

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,409
and different set of product projects

00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:42,020
that I'm Murat but in principle you

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:46,480
could see these elements and try to

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,480
think about how to get this instruction

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:58,450
so instead of setting up mirror brain

00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,670
for every project which would involve

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,650
quite some overhead because each of them

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,400
would have to know the mirrors and keep

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:11,019
your database and so on could also have

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,299
one big database which knows about the

00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,249
mirrors knows about the servers the

00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:19,829
contact persons about the content

00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:24,309
providers and keep this in line together

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:27,430
and this is actually not just the dream

00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:30,789
is actually not far from implemented I'm

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:36,009
working in next-generation database

00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:38,920
scheme that provisions for that so this

00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:42,249
becomes possible it's not a big step

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:46,349
it's just making things easier so you

00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:53,259
don't have to store me wrong many times

00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:55,690
so this nearly exists and a common

00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:58,269
database could actually lead to another

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,690
thing common file tree because those

00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:03,430
mirrors could actually have the same

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:08,130
file layout which would make it even

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:11,319
easier to find around on them and to

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:15,579
have a database that reflects their fire

00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:18,279
dream but this at this point it already

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:20,410
becomes might become difficult again

00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:24,190
because nobody knows if this is ever

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:27,999
possible to implement because it would

00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:32,650
involve changes on every mirror and I

00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:34,749
can say from experience that most of

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:39,789
these two hundred mirrors that I work

00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:41,829
with for Susan like fifty percent I have

00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:44,829
contact persons and the other three

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:46,900
quarters or other two quarters know the

00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,430
other half maybe I don't have don't even

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,339
have a contact person I don't find out

00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:55,329
about one it don't reach anyone even for

00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:58,240
tripa phone and it's very hard to get

00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:01,010
hold of people that are so far away and

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,240
they don't publish the email address or

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,200
it's completely outdated and it's it

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:13,190
would be an illusion to to say okay

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,530
let's get all these together and change

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,470
everything because it would never happen

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,119
and these mirrors are was a very

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:26,300
different very different operating

00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:27,710
systems honking of mirrors is also

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,320
interesting topic topic for

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,680
collaboration inform improvement because

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,400
everybody has some scripts that are

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:41,089
better or worse and it would be very

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:44,630
interesting to help to have something

00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:47,349
working which we can share so all

00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:52,220
together this would this could form some

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:54,020
free content delivery network that would

00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,820
actually deserve the name of a content

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,609
delivery network and wouldn't just be

00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:07,510
what we have now which is some isolated

00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:11,020
solutions and very different mirrors and

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:14,150
as you might might understand now the

00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:22,190
business of selecting mirrors and it's

00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:23,630
not so easy and most other solutions

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:28,760
won't get that right because it's a lot

00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:34,130
of work so here's my call for

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:39,790
collaboration I want I want mirror

00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:45,859
owners and content providers and users

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:48,980
and researchers to join a mailing list

00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:51,500
and to talk about these things because

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:57,020
it's very important to talk about this

00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:00,829
and it's always enlightening if you talk

00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:03,170
to I took I talk to fedora guy to pair

00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:05,630
from in river and so on and it's always

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,000
enlightening because everybody like

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,900
these specialized guys also have a lot

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,349
of lots of good thoughts about this

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,779
and mirror admins from around the world

00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:19,270
have their picture about their region

00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:21,609
and what happens there and what's the

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,020
political situation why is there no

00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:26,079
connectivity between north and south

00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:29,890
korea and so on and we need to get this

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,839
knowledge together and the interesting

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,920
thing is that main list like this

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,750
doesn't even exist there is no common

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:42,329
forum for these things I think they have

00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:46,109
been used group like 20 years ago which

00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:50,559
where's where these people were gathered

00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:52,569
but there's no place to meet you to meet

00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,640
them except you join the fedora mein

00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:56,680
mera mailing list or the Susan murmuring

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,170
list or office mera mailing list and

00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,599
then you always meet the same community

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,799
but there's no shared forum where also

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:09,400
the content providers are together on

00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:18,150
but there's a lot of potential to to get

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:26,140
them together so this basically is what

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:33,329
I wanted to share with you thank you for

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:33,329
