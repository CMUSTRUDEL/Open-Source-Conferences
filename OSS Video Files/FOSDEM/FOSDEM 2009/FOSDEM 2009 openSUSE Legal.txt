	00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,120
so let's start this is a talk about a

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,940
not so technical topic this is about

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,370
legal aspects mostly focusing on

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,000
licensing and our daily due diligence

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,789
jobs myself I'm you're in Vega I'm

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,939
member of the tools team and also of the

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,490
oh yeah of the legal suzay legal review

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,740
team which is not an official team it

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,340
never was formed to be there it just

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,780
happened to be me and 21 internal in one

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:39,899
external attorneys that consult with us

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:41,430
to resolve some things so yeah first of

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,890
all I give you a short overview what I

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,200
will talk about how have it in a few

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,730
sections to begin with I'll present the

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,309
basic concepts that we talked about this

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,430
is patents trademarks copyright issues

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,280
and for all of these the respective

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,020
licenses to know what can be done then

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,449
if a little bit more insight in the

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,450
details on some licenses that I chose to

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,619
present here maybe some fun in there or

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,479
not and then I have to talk about a

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,299
little bit about not novel what's our

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,880
background here and why we even what it

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,950
all have to care about licensing and in

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,020
in a perfect world yeah we just would

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,549
use free software as it is and

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,350
distribute something but novella is a

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,329
big company and they have to be prepared

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,329
for some other attorneys coming away and

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:36,479
asking buzzing and finally I'll give you

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,640
a short tour it's very superficial only

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,420
a short tour about how we do a review

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,049
work and we'll ask you for your

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,920
participation wherever we want to get

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,920
involved with the community

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,520
first of all and there's there's one

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,810
catch phrase that tries to sum up all

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,479
the different aspects of yeah the

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,790
catchphrase is intellectual property

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,130
which is more or less in illusion a

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,560
seductive Mirage says Richard Stallman

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,470
it does not it doesn't really help to

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,000
sum that up in one word so I would like

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,790
to give you hear some yeah plain English

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,410
definitions what these what these

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,140
different aspects means this comes

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,019
directly from our head vice president of

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,810
legal corporate novel he was so friendly

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,780
to use understandable words and not the

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,200
usual legal speak for that so a patent

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,019
tries to cover new useful and

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,280
non-obvious inventions it tries to cover

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:44,950
the idea behind such an invention not a

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,780
specific way to write it down this is

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,530
what a copyright is all about a

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,180
copyright tries to cover the text the

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,230
textual representation or the

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,920
implementation how such an idea is then

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,989
expressed or written down and yeah it's

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
only relevant for big companies probably

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:08,109
it's not relevant at all for our behalf

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,750
there are trade secrets things that the

00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,660
company does not want to share so yeah

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,209
I'll use that as an excuse from time to

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,420
time not to talk with you because we

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,910
have some trade secrets and these need

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,160
to be confidential because that's part

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,190
of what novell pays us to build some

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,280
something that is worth some money so

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,980
that we get paid for that and I respect

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,530
that too and the last thing and this is

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,620
some good point to start with is its

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,480
trademarks trademarks are everywhere if

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,329
you look at my t-shirt there's a little

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,630
green animal here and this color green

00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:49,090
also has some information that tells you

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,489
this is Susan here and there's where is

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,049
it novell the work down there there's

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,220
also some information so a trademark is

00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,840
a word or symbol that identifies and

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,290
distinguishes some goods be they

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,900
material or just software some goods or

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,659
services

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,700
from yeah they're completed competitors

00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:14,599
and from from other similar goods or

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:20,060
services that's a slight I yeah I show

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:24,380
that to you it's a bit scary here again

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,289
from our corporate legal person he says

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,710
these things have give you basic rights

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:33,169
and then he says what these things also

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,680
define are the remedies which is the

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,990
damages and injunctions that may happen

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,080
so that's that's typical for a lawyer

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,470
person to use some strange word actually

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,729
he's talking about rights but explains

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,039
what the right is Right prevent

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,780
something else that's a bit scary right

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,169
should not prevent something what is

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,110
meant that you have the right to say

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,370
that others should not do this or that

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,289
that's what copyright is all about you

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,900
know I have to copyright on my own

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:05,270
software so i can say don't use it it's

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,910
mine and actually copyright is more

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,039
defaults to it's mine and i have to give

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,590
you a permission to use that so that's

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,560
what he means by that so beware of the

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,930
way lawyers speak they try to use words

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,240
or they try to use strange words that

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,180
you don't know so yeah they have their

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,760
own language and a bit encoded that's

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,919
also where my team comes into the into

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,460
the image we translate or try to

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,330
translate into understandable or more

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,520
understandable english now I promised to

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,909
start with trademarks here's a little

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,070
collection of trademarks um yeah my

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,320
legal counsel especially my German legal

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,650
counsel was a bit scared when I told him

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,690
I will show this to some public audience

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,180
and have it cape and record it because

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,159
some of these trademarks well they

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,539
should not appear it says examples found

00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,310
in open source software but some of them

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,979
really should not appear in open source

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,340
software for example what what has

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,229
little scooby Doo which is from Warner

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,440
Brothers and is a trademark what has

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,990
that to do in a software package

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,200
probably nothing and much more is a

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,620
problem takatsu or that little guy from

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,919
Procter & Gamble

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:24,150
mr. clean these were found at a certain

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,740
time in past in software packages some

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,040
of them can stay around some of them are

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,150
really okay for example the Firefox logo

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,370
we have an agreement with Mozilla

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,310
Foundation to use the Firefox logo on a

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,160
suitable product so that's okay they

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,020
approve that and some others are just

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,040
historic things like we have a sun

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,180
microsystems star division logos in yeah

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,270
you guess what software that was

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,090
probably open office I want I went going

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,620
into the details for the others and from

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,639
time to time we find little things like

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,250
that which is just a few pixels but the

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,789
colors there they give a hint that the

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,160
windows logo is meant by that so yeah

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,539
you cannot avoid trademarks the windows

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,370
logo is a trademark of Microsoft of

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,919
course but you cannot avoid these things

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,820
so from time to time it's okay to use

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:19,250
them the trick is each company has a

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,599
very specific way to define or

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,750
guidelines how to how these thread max

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,060
can be used and the trick is a trademark

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,310
gets diluted it gets watered down it

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,630
gets useless over time if it is not

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,360
properly defended a current in-house

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,340
example is what we did with the opensuse

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,599
no but opens with the community dork

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,289
website we asked them to make none of

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,389
them here now we asked them to make the

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:51,810
website not green and not feature a Suzy

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:54,030
logo but make it blue and make some some

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,400
other adjustments just to be on the safe

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,660
side that our in-house mobile Council

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,539
don't say hey we have a trademark on

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,669
this we have to sue these guys now

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,010
recently songco correct me if I'm wrong

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,250
with that we started on our new

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,410
trademark guidelines and I assume

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,330
they're pretty safe that if if these

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,880
guys want to come back and want to use a

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,510
Suzy trademark on their website I guess

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,220
we can possibly approve that this this

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,780
should be part of our trademark policy

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:37,110
right

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:40,080
I can hand you to microphone so the

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,000
policy and draft form right now I think

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
they would be able to use it we're still

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,520
going back and forth and trying what we

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,700
really want to get to is a policy where

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,150
existing community projects things like

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,790
opensuse community org the opensuse live

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,890
CD the KDE 35 live CD and things like

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,870
that we want to get to a policy where

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,630
those the way they're using the

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,280
trademark now is considered okay but we

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,210
also need to make sure that we're not

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,670
getting too broad of permissions so i

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,850
just sent or well we've just had a

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,740
discussion on a draft and should be very

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,780
close to finishing the first draft and

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,940
this should be seen as in evolving

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,500
document to this isn't going to be yeah

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,660
when we put it out it's not going to be

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,270
finished completely our intention is not

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,300
to shoot of a people who are on our side

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,400
or helpful to our project we just had to

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,820
do that in a first step to be legally on

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,250
the safe side and then we make our

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,839
guidelines and invite them into join as

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,370
far as possible right because the other

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,589
thing is there's been a lot of confusion

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,080
so yeah yeah yeah and so the other thing

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:49,880
and we will give exemptions on occasion

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,040
yeah that's a good news okay thank you

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,040
so the next topic I'd like to talk about

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,860
this license is and and show you a few

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,160
aspects what kind of licenses we have

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,260
the usual thing you see in an f5 and any

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,900
source code file is it starts with a

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,750
copyright notice we're just by itself

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,760
moto license it is yeah what does it

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,860
tell us it tells us there are some

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,870
people involved or some entities

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,970
involved this is my email address it's

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,170
not even a proper name but it happens

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,560
that you find just an email address

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,320
there and novel Inc means probably yeah

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,900
one of these two or both are copyright

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,080
holders and then it says all rights

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,900
reserved so you know okay these two they

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,670
own all the rights in that software so

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,650
this is definitely not enough

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,200
using such soft and open source project

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,210
you need to have permissions and as I

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,860
already said as soon as the copyright is

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,900
here the default is even if it is not

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,790
stated explicitly here the default is

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:52,800
that yeah non-free you have to ask these

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,580
individuals or entities listed in the

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,350
copyrights header what can be done and

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,070
the best approach is that the copyright

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:05,070
owner needs to declare what exactly he

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,400
wants us to do with his software for

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,650
that we have a few possibilities how

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,140
this could be done I just browse quickly

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,300
over I guess this is fairly common

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,180
knowledge how this could happen the

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,210
first thing is he can try to actually do

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,190
this claim his copyright on his software

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,280
which means it becomes public domain and

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,410
the other options is of course draft the

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,900
license for that and explicitly tell or

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,110
simply adopt an existing license like

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,840
you PLO BSD licenses so for the first

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:40,530
one one simple example and not so simple

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,440
example because um yeah copyright law

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,080
does not apply universally on all on the

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,910
world for example in Germany we don't

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,270
have such a concept less copyright in

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,950
the strict sense we have our hiba

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,820
retched which is a bit a similar concept

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,670
so if I say my name here and I'm German

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,800
I Jurgen vying at the creator of this

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,020
work hereby release this work into the

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,500
public domain I say that and stop here

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,660
it may have actually no effect because

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,050
either the concept copyright just does

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:17,640
not apply and nothing happens or a

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:20,280
lawyer would say yeah he tried to but he

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,110
cannot release that even if we do it in

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,570
an indirect sense what could he have

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,210
meant being a German he has no copyright

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,860
here's this will he be correct what

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,260
could he have meant he could try to get

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,930
rid of all these rights but this is not

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,180
possible in Germany it happens a few

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,750
years after I die automatically but not

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,390
when I say so so that's different so the

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,340
best thing I can do is I say I want in

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,630
the case that this is not legally

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,290
possible to get as close as possible

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,630
unless some candy

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,980
are required by law I try to get rid of

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,050
any right that I have and try to express

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,240
that I mean exactly what in other

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,550
countries public domain would be so a

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,430
simple concept but still not that easy

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:10,920
due to local law the other option is

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:15,600
yeah draft an own license and the simple

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,290
answers don't do it please it's not easy

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,970
to draft the license today licenses tend

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,569
to get longer and longer and longer and

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,600
more complex if i compare GPL version 2

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:29,160
and GPL version 3 it's horror to read

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,240
these things and to really understand

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,550
them so ya novel has some involvement

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,889
there too and some of the conditions are

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,720
really tricky to read and understand so

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,240
it's basically it's a compromise from

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,490
what we wanted what others wanted a lot

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,970
of people try to mess around with that

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,889
license and yeah finally something came

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,100
there but yeah for you it for an

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:56,550
individual software developer don't

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,980
don't even try that same is if you take

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,500
a license that already exists like like

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,899
a GPL is a very good example for that

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,269
too and try to add something to the GPL

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:11,550
a further restriction or something then

00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:18,050
you should not do that some girl do you

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:18,050
still have that microphone no no do I a

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,040
list of preferred licenses yes noble has

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,769
a list of preferred licenses they have a

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,430
few on the on the internal website in

00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:34,740
the inner web of Novell but as far as I

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,199
know we don't have anything up up there

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,329
on the opensuse build service it may be

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,790
the the opensuse policy includes some

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:44,399
preferred licenses I talked about the

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,319
policy in a minute but it's not a direct

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,350
list of preferred not so good and

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:51,449
disallowed licenses it gets as close as

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,550
possible yeah so the message here is

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:56,040
choose from the existing license pool

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,260
don't draft your own the Free Software

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,600
Foundation has a range of licenses the

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,700
OC the Creative Commons website lists

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,280
them choose from these

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,650
and to give you just an impression what

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,870
happens we already have 500 different

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,400
licenses in our database and have to

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,950
deal with them on a day-to-day basis

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,250
please don't try to add any more onto

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,730
that these are derivatives of yeah let's

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,130
say roughly 5 50 50 licenses that are

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,560
really distinct licenses and then some

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,250
modifications to make this total number

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,530
which is a bit scary okay here's an

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,930
example of an existing license one of my

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:39,210
favorite because it's so short insert

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:41,460
distinct pull any encompasses do

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,530
whatever you want and if you like that

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,190
thing that stuff you can buy me a beer

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:49,710
that's a nice license so yeah it's very

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,200
close to the public domain thing but

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,700
yeah what do you think is this a

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,700
sufficient license is that good

00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,680
difficult to say yeah at least the free

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,350
software version says it's a valid

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,170
license may not be really a good choice

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,750
for some some things for example it's

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,730
not really clear he says if we meet

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,580
someday and you think this stuff is

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,650
worth it I know a lot of software from

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,650
which I definitely think it's worth it

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,290
to buy someone a beer so if this is all

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,560
true I think that and I meet this Paul

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,960
Henning camp is that an application for

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,120
me to buy him a beer I mean it's inside

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:37,500
his license text so what is inside

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:40,470
license.txt you can buy me but but this

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,950
is ken and please and may is nothing

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,980
that has a legal concept if no the other

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:50,310
way around if it's mentioned here it

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,590
means you should buy me a beer lawyers

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,800
are not that into the English language

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,600
they try to make the strongest claim of

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,060
anything that is written there even if

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,120
this had some vague language let they

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,100
try to be on that aha does that mean one

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,640
should or even one must imply if all

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,010
these conditions so this is a bit scary

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,709
actually the case was brought up by one

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,839
of our down stream's i guess it was IBM

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,270
it in the past when they said

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,449
we don't want to buy someone a beer it

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,069
just in case he shows up and and what is

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,409
that concept we're a company you're not

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,079
a person should accompany buy a beer for

00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:36,539
someone strange concept so yeah they

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:38,610
could yeah if they're just if if that

00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:40,830
would be cool manager saying if you ever

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,900
show up here we invite you to a beer but

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,279
let the lawyer at IBM there was not that

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,960
cool and he said a dangerous whenever he

00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,490
shows up we need to hear he shows up 10

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,500
times a day or what now rather not so

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,450
the other problem is this this license

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,070
is incomplete there are some very

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,029
substantial thing lacking on that

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,600
license because he grants some rights

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:08,669
but it tries not to protect himself

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,860
there is yeah there's there some

00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:13,230
countries where you can put your cat in

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,270
the microwave oven and then sue the

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,059
vendor of the microwave oven for some

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,190
problems with your cat afterwards so if

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,799
that should happen with software from

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,470
pull Henning camp say he he writes the

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,029
control software for the microwave hmm

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,309
yeah do whatever you want with that

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:33,270
stuff I mean I grilled my cat now it's

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:35,460
it has troubles hmm one could try to sue

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,970
whatever you want is it includes suing

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:42,770
himself so it's a bit scary so there's

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:46,080
another license for the fun part of it

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:51,659
but i want to show you two it's actually

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:54,330
used in a library called lip kaka not

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:58,710
live are up at lib caca it has this

00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:00,510
strange icon a heap of something and I

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,539
don't want to read this license to you

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,820
because they are swear words in them and

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:08,549
also one of our downstream company a

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,350
partner said we can never accept such a

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,299
license with such rude words in that

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,830
because this will be part of the

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,870
official documentation of our software

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,820
right and official documents of our

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,520
company never include this or this

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,520
others these words so they had a problem

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:27,450
with this license and asked us to change

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,159
the license so what we did we didn't

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,909
even ask upstream we

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:35,549
versus name somewhere Sam of his name ha

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:37,799
keV are we didn't even ask him we just

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,320
just applied the license that hey you

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,320
just do what you want yeah so let's

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,779
change license that's easy this license

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,059
explicitly allows me to distribute

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,970
verbatim or modified copies of the

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,859
license text that's great so what we

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,169
just did we deleted a few words and that

00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,580
uh-huh we received that from upstream

00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,909
and downstream we give that under a

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,070
modified license and we ask him

00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:05,039
afterwards and yeah he's just edit

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,159
that's perfect do that so that's the way

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,169
to work with licenses talk usually it's

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,759
not that easy as that but talk with the

00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:15,419
upstream talk with the down streams and

00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,460
get something solved now what addition

00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,989
to that license here which is a bit on

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,539
the funny side he did something very

00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:23,309
clever down that that paragraph I don't

00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,429
know if you can read that the most

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,049
important sentence is this software is

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,259
free software in this problems Phil

00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:34,139
effect comes without any warranty to the

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,340
extent permitted by applicable law so

00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,249
that's the most important thing in that

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:43,139
license have you weren t disclaimer down

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:45,690
there so that in case local law gives

00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:47,879
you a choice to say no no if your cat

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,960
has problems after the microwave session

00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:53,489
in and you want to step aside and don't

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,049
take the variant in case the law allows

00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:58,409
you to step aside and don't take the

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:01,320
warranty then do it step aside so in

00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:03,389
case it's allowed to say no no it's your

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,690
fault if something happens I want to say

00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:13,549
it's fault of the end user if something

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,549
happens here another question the back

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,950
tom

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,820
so did you change the the license only

00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:35,919
the paid Susie also in opensuse also and

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,019
opensuse because we don't want to have

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,370
too many different licenses around we

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,169
try to have a common codes to remember

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,669
everything comes from and I think it

00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:45,490
doesn't do any harm if you change it in

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,460
opensuse to actually asked him and he

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,049
was fine with a change so we change it

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,390
everywhere and I'd recommend to all the

00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:55,830
other distributors to also do such a

00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:00,610
change if you want to avoid swear words

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:02,740
another question colonel sauce has a few

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,929
nice comments there too yeah but I think

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,820
it's not really inside the license text

00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:10,419
adjust in the comments it was a lot of

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,889
question I'd like to ask there is there

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:17,980
a danger with those too permissive

00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:20,740
licenses that for example I can take the

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,320
source code and change the name of the

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,620
author and then I can say well he didn't

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:31,149
write this I wrote it yeah so how how

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:33,580
does the license because this doesn't

00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,380
happen this is a danger with the too

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,620
permissive actually with his license and

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,909
I think with a previous lessons too I

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,919
can do what I want with that so if I

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:45,130
want if I change the name and claim it

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:50,169
was my curve yes exerted his yes it is

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:52,750
allowed by that license good point ok so

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:54,519
this one is good this one is good so the

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,010
notice need needs to stay and I can add

00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,960
something so in that case we are fine

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,090
but in the other case here you're not

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,950
you're not so we could change the lesson

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,100
completely and say hey I just invented

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,500
that yes it's my own so yeah that's too

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,659
permissive license it does not protect

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,179
the original author and it is not very

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:16,929
helpful for us because who do we contact

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:19,210
if their software has a buck maybe the

00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,100
name never shows up again so this is a

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:26,230
good pointer to see who who wrote that

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:28,149
code ok some more questions it's not

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,399
really a question but i just find it

00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:32,380
ironic for this particular license to do

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,130
what you want resource because i

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,190
think some did it in your reaction

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:42,780
to all the that I brought about

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:45,810
all these intellectual property laws and

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,750
because it's someone who really he knows

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,270
very well the free software licenses it

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,510
was a formality PL and it is that

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:56,100
interaction to all this kind and all

00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:01,680
this kind of stuff and what you are

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:04,620
doing is just all is you're taking it

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,880
back in a proper form for for lawyers

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,490
and taken exactly that's what you're

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,200
trying to do so we accept that some

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,630
authors do not know how to write a

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,310
license and we try to help them make it

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,840
a little bit better that that's one of

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,480
the main reasons we contact the upstream

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,850
or two we could that you could do that

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,770
on our own and never talk to anybody but

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,900
we want to let him know hey yes where

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,420
roads here are not really good if you

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,130
like change it but he says no I actually

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,290
like that you can look up his website

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,330
here he has some good rationally on that

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,940
website he explains why this is a

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:45,450
license he likes so he was fine in that

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:47,250
case and didn't want to learn so what

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,290
happens in this license if that works on

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,630
it can't hear you if this website

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,570
mentioned in the end of the license if

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:58,050
it becomes unavailable in a few years

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,570
does it somehow devaluate this license

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:03,810
or it is I relegated that and is still

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:07,230
relative today but yes this might happen

00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:10,770
so it's not that's one other general

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,570
concept of licenses do not try to have

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,820
references in the license where you

00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:18,030
point outside everything that you need

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,640
to say say it in this text itself and do

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,110
not do not say I have a statement here

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,940
statement here and the rest you can read

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:29,130
on my website that's not a good thing

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,930
because then exact you looked it up it

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,910
is identical so in that case there's no

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,950
no additional information here it's

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,810
exactly duplicate so in that case it's

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,360
really fine to have a reference to the

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,360
website but yes that's a valid point one

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,400
should not use references to include

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,980
additional information or additional

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,960
restrictions so they might go away and

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,700
then yes to the restriction is lost

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,750
and people do things yet you never

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,250
intended okay I'm question what I'd like

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,529
to continue because I guess I'm running

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,450
out of time then yeah yeah shortly

00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:04,649
closing is you said you deal with a lot

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:09,529
of licenses do you try to contact people

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:12,840
who made the crew split from those few

00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:15,390
meaningful licenses and do you ask them

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,809
to merge with them so that the number

00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:21,149
decreases yeah we should actually we

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,100
have not the time to do that we are

00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,159
quite busy in our team to review

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,500
everything as it is asking for changes

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,659
that are not really needed yeah would be

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,130
a good thing to do so if you find

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,130
something like that you may want to

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,750
contact the authors currently we're a

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,669
team of three and Sue's you doing that

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:45,210
work so yeah the best option has already

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:47,640
mentioned is to use a license that

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,659
already exists obviously it may be

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,029
complex to choose correctly and yeah

00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,740
there are some details that make it

00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,990
compatible incompatible with other

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,909
licenses this is a topic on its own it

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,250
needs time to learn to read such a

00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,559
license and I don't want to go into too

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,440
many details for example want just one

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,690
example novel leader says GPL version 2

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,940
is a good license GPL version 3 is also

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,700
a good license but what no belt does not

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,100
want is to have the clause or any later

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,649
version this could mean that at some

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,029
point of time a version for comes into

00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:25,860
existence was completely yet unknown

00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:27,779
regulations in there and we have no

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,149
control on that so any novel software

00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:33,179
should not automatically switch over to

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,490
a license which we not yet know so this

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:42,200
is why we currently say these two are

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,200
good well we only we only say that one

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:49,029
yeah the GPL license suggests it's

00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,529
exactly that text you should say version

00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:54,039
to earn equations through on a later

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:55,750
version but you but you but you can

00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,909
modify it because it's not really part

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:02,500
of the license the way how you declare

00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:04,570
the license so yeah and this only this

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,000
also only applies where we really have a

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:09,669
choice of the license usually novell is

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,830
fine with you just adopt the license of

00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:13,090
the project for which you work for

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,820
example if you work on a month on a

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,500
mozilla based project then your license

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,679
is obviously Mozilla license we do we

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,230
don't try to to get a GPL into Mozilla

00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:27,659
license package don't do that accept the

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,659
license as it is that's the best thing

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,940
yeah there are a few more slides about

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:36,130
the technical details I'm not sure I

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,720
mean how much overtime I'm allowed to

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:45,460
use so i can i can run quickly through

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,710
that one if you have licenses and

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,320
multiple licenses that's where things

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,120
get complex it usually means that you

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,010
have to look at the interaction of these

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,899
licenses how they interact with it which

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,450
is each other and there's one concept

00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,549
called mere aggregation which means

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,649
there's a package sitting just next to

00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:04,059
another package and they don't interact

00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,770
with each other you're just on the same

00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:09,279
media or installed on the same computer

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:12,850
in that case different license with

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:15,340
different terms are usually okay but it

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,610
gets more difficult when components link

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,770
to each other the FSF has a good phrase

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,090
further explain what is meant by link if

00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:26,799
it is executed in the same address space

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,659
this may involve shared linking dynamic

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,960
linking the smells involve scripting

00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:33,640
languages address space is a bit spooky

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,370
when it comes to scripting languages but

00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,080
anyway if you have components that work

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,539
in the same address space or that are

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,700
linked against each other you have to

00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,279
check every statement in the license

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,770
check the other licenses compare them

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,720
make a metrics make a check or say ah

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,549
this doesn't work this gets really

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,410
complex and this is our day to day job

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,600
at the Susan to review these things

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,010
I don't want to go into a dual license

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,070
model every mention that this gives the

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,000
end user choice to make it easier for

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,470
such a competitive matrix for licenses

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,410
you also have to have your compliance

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,720
with the license what do you need to use

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,550
for example your GPL it's quite a long

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,610
list what you're all what you have to do

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:18,680
if you want to use a GPL for example you

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,630
have to declare whenever you modify the

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,960
code you do not need to shout that out

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,820
but for us we do it in the changelog and

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,040
we have the patches there and have the

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,260
original source anybody can compare what

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,540
was the changes and a few other

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:40,790
restrictions on top of that I press

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:44,090
space ya novel policy yeah I can almost

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,030
skip that one it means that developers

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:49,400
should read the text for confident he

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,650
notices that this includes restrictive

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,720
notices like there's a patent mentioned

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,010
in the source code in a comment hey

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,870
that's that's something you have to look

00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,640
for if the pattern is explicitly

00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,400
mentioned then go to the legal

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,230
department or come to my team and see is

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,570
it is a good thing to have that in there

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,310
or not so yeah we do we do some

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,310
screening on ourselves but being only a

00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,080
small team we ask everybody and also our

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,000
contributors on the boat service to do

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,920
some screening on their behalf and if

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,640
something is found that doesn't look

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:23,600
right just come to us if it makes sense

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:27,230
to you this is also a statement made by

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,950
the novell a proof in seek approval if

00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,080
needed not generally and yeah it gets

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,390
difficult you cannot approach the legal

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,860
department for any little notice you

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,720
find is this a good one is the bad one

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,820
so we need to apply common-sense here

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,490
and for that reason our little team got

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:48,710
established to handle almost everything

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:51,080
that is in this user distributions yeah

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,210
what we do with the opensuse this is

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,610
what I wanted to mention about opensuse

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,620
policies we have a list of licenses that

00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,040
we say our good and this is exactly the

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,360
list published by you're busy OSI and

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,950
these are good and we have exceptions to

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,280
that list of course on a case-by-case

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,280
basis and the other important policy is

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,720
that we do not

00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,060
review everything that is in the build

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,510
service so there might be something that

00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:17,490
goes away suddenly in case we get notice

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,930
that there is for example a possible

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,540
patent infringement if you put your

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,730
favorite mp3 player there and we think

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,070
oh this person or we don't have a

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,440
permission to public to publicly make

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,920
available mp3 decoder which is a

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,820
patented software then we better ask the

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,110
the maintainer of that to remove it or

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,390
if it has a patent license the other

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:42,290
let's hear but usually such a guy has

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,760
not has not a patent license for that

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,890
same thing and that this gets more

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,920
complex is now Hannah mentioned that

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:54,080
earlier how we do submit requests into

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,790
the build systems now a general concept

00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,180
how we do legal review if such such

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,950
thing happens it is what I want to show

00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,740
here is some two tracks going in

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,800
parallel while the production team the

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,380
package a team does packaging from that

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,740
from factory under shipment in parallel

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,810
the fork over workflow and do license

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,690
review a detailed license review and

00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,990
some final reporting so that we don't

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,070
delay or production units too long

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,960
that's one of the general concepts i

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,750
want to say here we do it in multiple

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,420
steps the first part is fully automated

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,670
we have some scripts there to try to dig

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,480
they are not perfect what try to dig

00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:39,060
some keywords and some catchphrases most

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,620
time gee pls mentioned we find that but

00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,650
in case of the other licenses here it's

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,660
not so easy to automatically find them

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,570
this is a first step and then we have a

00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:53,340
manual review where we iterate over the

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:56,310
code from time to time this is a slide

00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,050
just go to the second one where I want

00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:01,410
to compare the internal build service

00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:04,200
and the external build service these two

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,420
currently exists in parallel and most

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,000
people only see this part of the world

00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:14,700
and not that part because this is

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,649
internal to Susan so from these we do

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,330
our commercial product range and from

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,230
the other one we do the opensuse product

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,779
range and in both cases

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,509
we have a review team sitting in between

00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:30,299
Hannah mentioned that earlier this was

00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:32,609
the original audible team and the team

00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:34,349
on my behalf and for the opensuse build

00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:36,480
service we have to define something new

00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,999
because it doesn't scale to always ask

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,589
the maintainer and actually there's no

00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:42,569
legal review if just the maintain is

00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:44,819
decide what to do so we have to have

00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:46,829
some kind of reverb or there so this is

00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:48,480
a bit of dreaming for future how this

00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:52,230
could be in parallel or maybe it's even

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,559
just one team across both perhaps to

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:58,170
merge them somehow that's ideas for the

00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:02,400
future so what what you might notice of

00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,289
our doings is some sometimes bugzilla

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,029
may appear on your desk and email from

00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:08,279
bugzilla saying you have a legal issue

00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:10,230
in soon as we found something please

00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:13,980
help us resolve that or we directly

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,819
write email so this is where we ask for

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,249
your cooperation or for your help to

00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:22,769
discuss the issues we might think a

00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:24,569
series or not so serious in the initial

00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:26,730
stage nobody knows if an issue is really

00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:28,349
a serious thing or just yeah sloppy

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,779
writing of something but the intent was

00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:33,869
good so this is very need to discuss or

00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:37,519
seek alternatives or yeah in some cases

00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:40,680
just we go to management somebody says

00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,710
take it not to take it without any

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,489
further legal advice this also happens

00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:49,619
it's not so good so my final words for

00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:53,190
today is what I wanted to do with this

00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,789
little talk get some visibility get in

00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:59,039
contact with people and if possible to

00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:01,319
make a workload easier share some of our

00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,720
infrastructure we have been in contact

00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,670
with the Fedora guys with Tom Keller way

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,009
I don't if you see here over there great

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:11,670
so I come to you afterwards we talk a

00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:15,450
little bit and try to find a way how can

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:17,160
we do not duplicate work but what we

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,739
already did you should not repeat or

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,390
need to repeat and vice versa that we

00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,130
can make some public forum like a

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,440
mailing list or something we can discuss

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,299
on the other end I don't want to shout

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,400
out in the public hey we found something

00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:31,849
wrong in our product please come and see

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,930
us everybody I don't want to do that I

00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,800
know somebody who already did some

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,690
blocks and

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,750
said something like that it's a bit

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,350
scary it's it may be good for fedora but

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,450
it's not so good for well for Furnival

00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:49,640
yeah that's basically it my first step

00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,640
is taken today thank you for listening

00:36:49,700 --> 00:37:04,920
questions okay so i have this a very

00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,950
trivial program and as you told us i

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,650
should give him a license or utilize and

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,410
so what license do I choose I don't want

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:17,550
twenty five kilobytes of GPL for 300

00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:19,650
bytes of C codes know if you write a

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,960
trivial program which is just a few

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,820
hundred lines of code and you go through

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,030
and look through the novel policy the

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:32,220
novel policy says this should be GPL two

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:34,200
or three so include in that case you're

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,210
in like a position that you're in German

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,510
and not everything you create is

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:41,130
automatically owned or no gamellia

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,200
acquires the rights for that so you can

00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,610
choose in your free time use in your

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,730
free time user license what you want

00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:52,860
yeah just use a simple one if you like

00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:55,410
that one sure allow me to add to your

00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,080
answer that's an order just compile a

00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:01,050
program you need a license the act of

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:04,830
compiling source code requires a license

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:07,800

without a license is nothing anybody

00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,620
else could use so yeah everything should

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:18,420
have allies and should be clearly stated
