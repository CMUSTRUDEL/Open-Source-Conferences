Publication date: 2011-12-22

Description: 
	This presentation will discuss history of ext4, its features and advantages, and how best to use the ext4 filesystem.

The latest generation of the ext2/ext3 filesystems is the ext4 filesystem, which recently left the development status of 2.6.28. With extents, delayed allocation, multiblock allocation, persistent preallocation, and its other new features, it is substantally faster and more efficient compared to the ext3 filesystem.
