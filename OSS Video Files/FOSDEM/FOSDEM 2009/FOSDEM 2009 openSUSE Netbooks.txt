	00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,420
it's not here

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,970
so this is about opensuse on netbooks as

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,850
you can see it apparently takes a little

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,100
bit longer yeah it's one of those new

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,790
cool machines probably everybody has one

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,680
with him yes okay so you all know what

00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:54,870
it is this is about the new interesting

00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:04,019
stuff that int'l brought us or at least

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:09,810
they claim to have that so oh yeah it is

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,970
slower yeah okay so I introduce myself

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,670
first I'm Stefan cybrid working at the

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,280
desktop team with or at the gym mobile

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,490
devices at Susan Nuremberg and there i'm

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,509
working with all sorts of machines among

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,929
others with with netbooks and we are

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,140
trying to get those going if possible

00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:33,960
out of the box without any major Hecker

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,820
II involved Padilla we'll see how this

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,369
is working out and we're basically doing

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,590
all all kinds of mobile stuff from

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,630
netbooks onwards so we are not doing

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,340
much embedded stuff for phones or so

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:50,460
beer the pc guys still okay so let's

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,310
start the talk has three parts first

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,259
part is a little bit a short overview

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:59,600
over the hardware actually not that

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,939
interesting part two is the software

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,380
there are again two parts as a there are

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,740
colonel drivers and stuff and there's

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,959
the user interface part and the thing

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,209
that i considered the interesting part

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,209
of this talk is the tips and tricks in

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,459
the daily usage what are the because in

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,790
the end installation is usually pretty

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,400
easy and but it's in my opinion those

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,590
machines are more than just a small or

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,549
notebook or a cheaper notebook but they

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,840
are apparently i have the opinion that

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,480
you need a little bit of a different

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,180
usage pattern photos and i try to to

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,799
share what I have found out over the

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,930
last year and actually i was using small

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,700
machines all the time before they had

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,360
not 10 inch screens but 12 inch screens

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,420
but many of the experience is similar

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,060
let's start with T hardware what's so

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,370
special about those netbooks those are

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,299
usually pretty small and lightweight

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:01,090
devices as far as I know actually in 24

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,859
bits the manufacturers to put in a

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,540
larger display than 10 inch if they want

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,939
to use the atom processor the cheap one

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,019
so all those machines usually have less

00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:15,340
than 10 inch display they have a low

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:19,030
power consumption if you compare it with

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,340
other pc laptops they have a small

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,769
screen and keyboard the hardware is

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,540
fairly uniform because most of them

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,019
today have the in delight on processor

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,230
and an intel graphics chip and there are

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,829
some with a wire processor and why are

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,169
cheap but they are not very common and

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,819
yeah they are also not that well

00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:45,599
supported let's say that way they some

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:48,040
models for example this one have a

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,470
pretty low storage capacity because it

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,699
has a built-in flash device which only

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,829
only has eight gigabytes and this can be

00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,479
challenging there also their triple epcs

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,479
I think they had four gigabytes of stuff

00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,790
and so you of course that's not really a

00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:07,060
problem and this is more than my more

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,799
than ten tenth of the capacity for my

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,349
first hard drive but it's built for

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,609
today's standards it's not much you need

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:17,440
to to look into that what are the

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,690
problems with this are rare the adhan

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,870
terrier again it's the low storage

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,210
capacity of some models and something

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,740
that I'm experian pretty painfully all

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,780
the time is that especially those flash

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,490
devices even though they were so to

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,289
assess to be faster more reliable

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,330
consuming less power they are at least

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:41,740
the cheap ones that are built into the

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,630
netbooks are very slow they have a

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,729
decent read and write rate but as soon

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,430
as you do an eps ink something goes

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,530
awfully wrong and yes please come in

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,449
something goes awfully wrong and they

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,460
take very long time for example if you

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,620
install packages it's really a pain in

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,570
the ass because the RPM database does an

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,090
eps ink on its all

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,580
then actually even though they all look

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,860
the same from the first look at the

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,870
hardware it's not as uniform as you

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,420
think you cannot imagine what strange

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,940
kind of Biola's lon devices you find on

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,350
these things because almost every

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,130
business notebook you get out there

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,990
today has an intel graphics intel

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,010
processor and has an int'l wireless LAN

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,870
and those usually just work you they may

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,170
not work perfectly they may have some

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,810
issues but you basically never get one

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,790
that just does not work at all those

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,580
devices there is apparently the

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,510
possibility to save 50 cent by buying

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,450
some strange wireless chipset from some

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:55,140
unknown Taiwanese vendor these brought

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:57,270
us the rtl8139 lon cards or the in

00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,670
famous broadcom chip set the Baron

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,950
reverse engineer driver exists but it

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,250
actually does not work that well all the

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,030
time so there are hardware problems

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,380
especially in the wireless area which is

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,140
a pity because especially on those

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,080
machines wireless is even for my opinion

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,750
is even more important than on a on a

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,340
desktop I for me I don't really care

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,990
about wireless if I have a desktop and

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,300
if I have a cable i use that cable i

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,930
won't use violence because it's still

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,060
faster and on a normal notebook most of

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,160
the time it works so why was it even

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,660
more important and you have to choose to

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,730
hardware carefully to get it actually

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,060
going out thought more about this and

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,620
then the machines are small tilly they

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,410
have small batteries which also means

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,900
even though they need not as much power

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,430
as a big machine you still didn't

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,440
sometimes don't get a much longer

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,290
battery life or sometimes even a shorter

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,970
battery life so going for six or seven

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,250
hours is today possible with netbooks

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,610
and even more but those are usually some

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,580
machines with a pretty big battery or

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,470
 battery or those are the what I

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,140
call the high-end netbooks there are

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,210
also a little bit more expensive

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,000
probably you get what you pay for there

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,970
too

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,460
then we come oratory software because in

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,400
the end the hardware is not really that

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,169
interesting from a Linux distributors

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,719
point of view because it just works this

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,699
the processor is not really different

00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:28,139
from an old pentium 3 from as far as i

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,319
can tell so the colonel does not need

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,610
special adaptations driver stuff that

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,169
needed to get in for a chipset is

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,770
already long and main line so there is

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,990
no real problem apart from the from some

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,639
device drivers will talk about it or has

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,780
anybody had a different experience I

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,310
said okay I had a machine that did not

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,780
boot at all with and I needed some

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,590
special Linux patch I haven't seen this

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:52,110
for quite some time so the hardware it's

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:58,530
there and it's working and so ya can

00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:00,810
move on to the software so yeah as I

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,169
told wireless LAN drivers are often

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,389
problematic we have a we have a nice hit

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,039
list of extra layer is that my colleague

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,830
who is doing the viola stopped and asked

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,529
him okay what should I recommend what

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:17,669
chipsets do I should I recommend and is

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:20,610
that okay spare those s there's only

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,219
actually only one chipset that is sold

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,870
in the netbooks that I that you can

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,940
actually recommend and that's right now

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,159
the atheros chipset because that's the

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,589
only one that has a driver that's

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,750
working pretty well and said okay but

00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,010
that I have seen other netbooks also

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,110
work so there must be something that

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,409
they're okay after a service that comes

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,620
nothing nothing nothing and nothing and

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,990
then there's raleighnc which have some

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,269
out of three driver they're actually

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,180
working on it but it's not really going

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,160
upstream and it's a little bit you need

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,350
a lot of tweaking but if it works if you

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,180
get it running the it works and said

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,740
okay but this can't be everything you

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,410
must be more drivers around there's my

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,339
hardware that yeah then comes nothing

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,920
nothing nothing and then there comes a

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:09,660
real tech and Broadcom broadcom is

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,880
especially funny because there is a

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,980
binary only driver on the broadcom side

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,130
which is of course very funny because

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,829
you have always if you like this sort of

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,480
fun whenever you change the colonel

00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,339
revision you have to check if the module

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,810
still works and if it still compiles and

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,920
it's

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:30,330
actually not what I consider fun and

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,440
there is also a reverse engineer driver

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,060
but it's it's it's good enough that it

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,730
detects the card and it's sometimes work

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,470
but it's it's as far as i know it

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,540
doesn't do encryption very well and it's

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,190
it's not very well that's really funny

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,590
about broadcom and something which i say

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,360
okay go tell these people what you think

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,220
about what you think about them is if

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,150
you go to the broadcom website you

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,340
really get a strong warning to please

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,260
remove all these community driver stuff

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,540
I think it's imperative this community

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,370
drivers is that okay yeah you know this

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:07,730
is what they're thinking about us should

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:10,320
we buy their hardware I'm not sure so

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,540
actually if you want the machine

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,820
probably it's possible to get those all

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,220
going but it's with a different levels

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,050
of pain and of time you need to invest

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,870
to get your machine running to get your

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,460
wireless going so it's in my opinion

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,290
it's pretty important to check out

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,030
before you buy the machines they are all

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,440
pretty similar you get them all with

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,930
similar display sizes there they have

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,370
different keyboards and separates

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,130
actually they're all pretty small too

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,690
small to touch type so check out if

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,870
there's hardware that's well supported

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:46,140
if there's an a terrorist card in there

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,550
I'd say go for it there is no netbook

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,460
known to me actually the chips with an

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,590
intel chipset I was wondering why they

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,060
are but probably they are just costing

00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,360
two dollars more or something eleventh

00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,390
that's yeah just too much I've heard

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,510
rumors about a special int'l netbook

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,150
wireless LAN chipset coming up but I

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,330
have not seen it and so I cannot

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,430
recommend it now just our stuff in this

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:16,260
machine's then wireless LAN for example

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:20,610
in this acer this is an S pie or 10 it's

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:24,750
the flash model a 110 I think one of the

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,280
first acer sizing the card readers they

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,340
need some tweaking there's you need a

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,200
special module flag to force the PCI

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,490
Express hot black driver which is

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
interesting and ever knew that card

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,960
readers were PCI Express hot black and

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,140
there is no other pci-x

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,240
a slot no Express card but these are

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,250
stuff that you need to get sometimes to

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,340
get those going but it's in the end it's

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,080
the same as with our relatively new

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,910
hardware you need some special things

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,030
there are ya how do i phrase that

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,250
without insulting anybody and some

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,980
interesting pious workarounds that you

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,540
need and those are from those type that

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,690
I usually have only seen from the very

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,550
cheap consumer class notebooks that you

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:16,170
get at the Bigfoot discount or stuff

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,670
like that so we're again sometimes have

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,560
the impression on those netbooks the

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,870
bios is the same as the hardware

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,120
sometimes so they oh it would cost five

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,650
cents more to fix this bug but we have a

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,530
patched colonel where it runs anyway

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,960
with the Linux distribution bishop or it

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,440
runs with windows XP so we ship it

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,480
anyway and depending on the vendor it

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
might be hard getting a fixed by or so

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,870
for example this card reader stuff with

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,730
a pci express what black medulla the

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,500
kernel developers are arguing if it's a

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,810
combo pack or if it's a bios park for

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,590
you as a user yeah it doesn't doesn't

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,960
really help in the end this all is not

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,250
really different from a normal machine

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:02,100
from a normal I say that from a normal

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:06,350
consumer class notebook they often have

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:09,690
similar problems the the hardware is the

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,150
coast efficient type the bios is the

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,350
cost efficient type and you have to do

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,660
some stuff to get it going it's even

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,970
even from that you get those from

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,680
vendors they know they know how to ride

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,840
the proper buyers because they have a

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,990
big business class notebooks that just

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,350
work out of the box but yeah it's

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,080
probably a different different part of

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,410
the corporation who is doing though so

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,910
the 111 part of the corporation has the

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,260
good buyers riders and the others have

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,670
the bad one sir I don't know how it

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,710
works okay any questions to drivers are

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,210
stuffed or any experience you want to

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,730
share if you had a netbook and had a

00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:59,130
really hard time getting it going

00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:02,519
even yeah the new railing just works for

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:05,130
some stupid reason okay so this is is it

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,839
now in the in the staging tree click or

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,180
or is it the new driver that you get

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,800
from the from the pinellas on the

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,810
website always you had it down or

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,820
yourself and now there is just a default

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,560
module included in the installation so I

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,279
don't know where that module comes from

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,709
okay so yeah of course rolling rolling

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,720
car actually not the very bad guys

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,279
because they apparently have some

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,760
problem working with kernel developers

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,949
and well all of you who ever had to deal

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,180
with kernel developers I can sometimes

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:36,079
understand why people have problems

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,550
working with those it's not always easy

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,110
if there's a corporation and say okay we

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,389
are doing a driver and then there come

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,170
heard of kernel developers are you doing

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,420
this wrong you're doing that wrong

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,810
there's a white space issue I don't like

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,699
your ugly defines and say okay we are

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,220
not really targeting inclusion in the

00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,350
car were just going for you can't

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,060
download it at first sight and sooner or

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,610
later somebody will also clean up this

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,569
driver and so if Rollins not working

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:09,529
better very good so in this case I'd

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:09,529
recommend a terrorism growling okay yes

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,329
yeah so um what about the camera I you

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,269
are going to speak about camera driver

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:24,510
camera built-in in the netbook and I

00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:27,569
actually did not try but most of them

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,940
are standard USB cameras of course

00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,589
there's surely one or the other one who

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,069
is non-standard it needs a special

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:36,480
driver but generally USB cameras or more

00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:42,180
and more going for the there's a

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:46,170
universal video module he needs to pull

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,149
it up and buy junk and that everyone has

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,310
that was from Isis from really old

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,310
laptop sets now in everything and only

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,459
26 28 it's included so in order to

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,760
recompile everything ok so that's just

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,589
because 26 28 was already out so they

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,730
could have back positive but they don't

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,550
do that so

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,500
but in with the next car when factory

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,389
goes to the new kernel of in the general

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,649
of distributions all the time talking

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,690
here is actually not really open through

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,639
the specific because it's the same for

00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,649
every distribution so when the

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,899
distributions get a new kernel then you

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,339
get a driver and what's good about this

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,110
machine is actually that they are sold

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,199
in pretty huge quantities so there's

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,850
some some incentive for many developers

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,910
to actually work on those many people

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,620
who basically stuff like reverse

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,630
engineering webcam protocols or so you

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,959
need somebody who really has a need to

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,370
you don't do this for fun if you don't

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,589
have to harder for yourself so let's

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,209
they are sold in huge quantities and

00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,910
they are actually cheap enough that

00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:47,190
people say okay it's not fully supported

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,930
but it's cheap i'll buy it and i'll try

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,790
what I can do and so we're getting

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,019
pretty good driver development I guess

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,389
that will also happen to the wireless

00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,209
LAN drivers I'm just a little bit pissed

00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,800
off that it's the situation is not

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,899
really getting better after years are

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,660
not that much better so there's a few

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,850
chipsets you can recommend and still

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,819
there are year up here a few you count

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:12,660
and yeah but in the end it's not really

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,720
different from a normal machine for the

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,260
user interface there's actually I'm

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,250
advocating to try out new stuff if you I

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,350
am I'm a hardcore KDE usual normally but

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,150
on the netbook extra said okay let's try

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,940
something different because Katie for in

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,660
the default the configuration has a

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,090
pretty huge for a for a small resolution

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,500
pretty huge window decoration and a big

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,630
panel and stuff and actually i think

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,260
it's it's time with such a new machine

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,240
to try out different stuff using

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,990
generally using a lightweight desktop

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,030
like I don't know xfce or a very lightly

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,580
configured que te org no more whatever

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,500
is a good idea on such a machine because

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,330
they are generally fast enough for

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,340
almost everything you can even run

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,020
openoffice on those that's they have

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,710
enough memory they usually come with

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,660
today with one gigabyte I think this one

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,409
still has 512 but it was one of the

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,880
first that we that we bought and usually

00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,680
they have one gigabyte and more so you

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,290
have in now

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,260
when the processors are also fast enough

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,780
it's not not a problem but the generally

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,350
on a small machine using small

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:30,320
applications is might get you better

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,290
performance and more satisfaction then

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,640
there's application generally the on

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,680
this machine's the screen width is

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,110
usually not an idea I have to admit that

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm a chicken i switch to 800 x 600 for

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,350
presentation because otherwise we with

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,440
the widescreen we would have probably

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,030
have black bars left and right and i

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,120
didn't have time to sort it out some but

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:53,660
generally the screen width is thousand

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,690
24 or bigger on most machines save the

00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,600
small old epc Tripoli which head I think

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:05,170
800 x 480 yeah which is very small but

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,110
that those new ones all have thousand 24

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,940
x 600 or 576 the new ones apparently

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,500
because the bigger panels are no longer

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,910
available they're all sold out so they

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,350
had to resort to 16 29 and the screen

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:23,150
with is not a problem screen height

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,980
actually is and there is stuff that

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,680
needs to be fixed in the application i

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,260
have found 1i just a short demo because

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:36,140
it was so funny in the actually in the

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,050
ocular que te fewer that I'm I was

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,230
trying to set up stuff and there's

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:45,200
where's the ok button it's gone there is

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,300
nothing there's no ok button so for me

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,520
that's no problem i know i can hit alt +

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,190
+ shift it up and so I can hit ok and

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,750
cancel and no there's not and the next

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,120
thing that is no way to resize the okay

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,950
it just resized that no no somebody

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,950
decided that this dialog has to be at

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,500
least 600 pixels high so you have no way

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,990
to resize that and this something that

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,270
I'm not sure if this for example would

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,090
need to change in the also in the

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,130
toolkits why is there no no flag I can

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,800
say okay I can resize this dialog and it

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,820
gets the scroll bar here and without the

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,830
application program are having to know

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,520
that but there's maybe a global flag

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,770
something stuff like that will happen i

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,480
think on a desktop or another thing that

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,809
I this dialog is extremely

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,520
because I can show all those all those

00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:36,440
pain that you have if you do it to full

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,880
screen it's not going to get any more

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,500
useful for me as I've never done any QT

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,410
programming or Katie or any great

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,090
programming at all why can't it just

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,210
arrange this stuff side by side if I put

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,010
it on force minutes the the screen is

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,650
almost double as wide as its high so

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,390
they would obviously that would be

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,580
enough space to put these buttons there

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:02,600
but there are not so this is those are

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,280
issues with applications that I hope and

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,590
I think they will be fixed because all

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,049
those applications need to get also more

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,000
more portable towards small machines

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,910
mobile phones nobody wants to program

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,040
everything buy everything new so they

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:20,570
want to have adjust the maybe a small

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:23,540
layer on top that a like the maybe the

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:28,760
KDE the KDE 4 plasmoid stuff already

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:30,500
which has a another word some kind of

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,990
context sensitivity if you pull a

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,090
plasmoid into the apple into the into

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,590
the taskbar it behaves it displays

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,570
differently the still does the same

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,179
thing but you can for example put the

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,190
photo of you into the taskbar and there

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,190
is a button which which shows you all

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:49,280
the contents of the photo and no longer

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:52,610
no longer and I like the test with the

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,250
normal desktop photo anyway before I'm

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,100
this pressing here test of people are

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,020
knowing and working on the issues and if

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,640
you find such a dialogue like iphone now

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,330
i did not already file the back roads

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,400
but this is a back in the end and file a

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,130
bug report if you find it on opensuse

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,620
file a bug report for it because you

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,120
might sometimes you might need to argue

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,590
with the developer why this is needed

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,260
but if nobody tells that the people that

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,179
this is needed they won't fix it unless

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,410
they start using netbooks by themself

00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:27,309
but probably not as the main development

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,140
machine so those are those are

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:32,210
application box that need to be fixed

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,230
and this is something that you that's

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,299
the at the duty of the users to report

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,130
the box we can try to fix them at the

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,590
developers but the users need to report

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,320
them some some stuff I think I find by

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,910
myself but

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,350
yeah we need back reports so now comes

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:55,320
the interesting part because that's what

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:58,080
I found out yep sorry one more one more

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,540
question concerning user interfaces it

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,230
appears to me that almost every destroy

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,800
even every vendor advances know his own

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:11,280
starting application launcher so

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:15,690
sometimes you have very big buttons on

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,780
some translucent windows overlaid over

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,290
your KD or genome desktops and there are

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,210
other approaches what do you think will

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,120
there be some kind of consolidation in

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,580
the future or do we have to deal with

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:36,450
all the different approaches well

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:37,950
there's always the actually the last

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:43,410
person was what is the open suse

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:45,360
approach and I don't know but I hope we

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,850
will get some consolidation on the other

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,140
hand because it will need to be some

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,460
controller it's just a waste of

00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,820
resources when everybody does the same

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,560
thing over again on the other hand you

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,170
cannot restrict developers because they

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,520
do what they want anyway so and if they

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,840
think it's a good idea they will try it

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,570
and so you will always see variations on

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,020
a theme with with this stuff then

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,210
there's in every although not all but

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,370
many of the larger distributions have

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,470
have a company behind it as a marketing

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,380
department as says L we need something

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:23,490
to differentiate and believe me we try

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,260
them that differentiation with with the

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,840
number of patents you have on the screen

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,700
or with the color of is not a good

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,970
differentiation but they need to learn

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,980
it and yet so I fear we have to live

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,960
with it for a few more years but in the

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,490
end the best solution will win out and

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,590
the more stuff that is actually tried

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,100
and to try to find out what's what's

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:49,170
useful what's what's uh what's really

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,000
what the users actually can use what

00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,890
what's good for them that this is the

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,230
thing that will prevail that's the one

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,700
that we will see five years from now so

00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,980
I'm

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,900
there will always be that this is an

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,210
open source world there are program

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,130
projects forked and rejoined all the

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,920
time and it's actually a good thing and

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,750
yeah the question is do we really need

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,610
one more application launcher other than

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:18,570
don't we do I wouldn't butters you can

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,970
fight everything so then we come to the

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,130
tips and tricks and let's start with

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,230
preparing your installation some of

00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,150
those and I'm assuming of course

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,150
everybody wants to install open Suzie on

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,640
his brand new shiny netbook so but also

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,200
who importance or something else if

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,530
there is a novel linux installed already

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,010
i would actually recommend to create an

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:43,590
image of the installation if possible or

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,920
tar it up completely just make a backup

00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:48,780
of it or if it's known that the rescue

00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,180
CD that is shipped with it will actually

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,450
work then yeah this is fine but actually

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,910
creating an image today is not really

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:59,370
expensive you write it USB disk and

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:04,320
that's always good to have a way to go

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:06,180
back and because there is often with the

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,860
pre shipped installations there is a

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,550
hectic camel they have some strange

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,230
caramel module or there is a you need to

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,270
find the option that's needed for the

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,880
PCI Express hot black module to get the

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,980
card reader going so creating an image

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,160
allows you to restore the original state

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,290
backing up et Cie basically is where

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,930
most of the configuration probably is

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,990
third and this allows you also to find

00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,310
out how did they configure special stuff

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,260
apart if there's an if they have a

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,000
special Colonel patch you're out of luck

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,750
you won't find this in EDC and now also

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,470
not in the image usually then explore

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:45,180
the original installation they often

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,180
have put some work into it to making it

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,160
usable for non-geek normal users because

00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,070
those machines are actually so to normal

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,120
people with linux on so they're not yeah

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,730
there they are not solely target on

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,820
cheeks but also on a non mom and dad

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,430
basically you can sometimes get this on

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,540
the food discounters in germany those

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,559
machines with and so they have done

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,769
something

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,129
to make this this Linux a little bit

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:19,710
more usable and tried out you of course

00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:21,179
often this is in some annoying stuff for

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,149
the advanced users but there might be

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:27,149
one or the other nice thing in there try

00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:29,669
it out explore it and maybe write it

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:32,159
down what was good so if you later see

00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,049
okay I've now this opensuse or fedora or

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,360
debian or you bunt or whatever on it and

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,429
this is cool everything is working fine

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,100
but this one button was really a good

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,289
idea then in the case of open zoo say

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,080
create a feature request because or or

00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,639
if it's just a small thing create a bug

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,450
report and enhancement back report

00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:53,039
because I'm looking at some of those

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,159
machines but I can look on all of them

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,289
and actually for me most of the time

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,809
when we get a new one yeah we create the

00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:03,240
image but then we have to get going to

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:06,029
get Susie running on it week I don't

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,100
have time to spend the day or two

00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:11,159
exploring the original installation I

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,019
try to but I'm off night just can't so

00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,610
this is stuff which i think is important

00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,610
to the community at large to make the

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,590
products better because often if a store

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,509
sells this machine with it there's also

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,519
i'm not sure about the desktop was that

00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:25,799
was on it but it's there is as i knew

00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,149
there was an application it had seven or

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,190
eight buttons big buttons and

00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:33,299
application launcher that normal people

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:35,879
could launch the office fire frogs email

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,450
program and it had some some custom

00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:41,669
internet connection tool i think the the

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,139
image was made shortly before a network

00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,299
manager had all the features that i did

00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:48,720
something by themselves and it's I think

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,879
it's important to check out somebody was

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,610
paid to do this and it was probably not

00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:56,279
done totally wrong so you can at least

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,080
look at it and steal from them but if

00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,059
they if they don't release the source

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,499
code to you you can at least look okay

00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,169
we can do something similar or maybe

00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:06,720
something better that's important also

00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:10,409
if you they don't need to get the heart

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,090
rate going the installation you have on

00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:17,070
the machine when it shipped is already

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:20,129
running so lspci lsusb LS mod all this

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,679
stuff it can't hurt to save it on a USB

00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:24,130
stick and have it later if everything

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,190
works out of the box you

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:30,490
needed but you also have lost nothing

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:32,470
then first try with a live CD or live us

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,090
peace medium assumption Elliot it's

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,880
probably a good idea to see if it's

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:39,460
working at all or if it's maybe in that

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,940
special case of hardware maybe Ubuntu

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:47,380
works better so try before you install

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,540
then the installation as such is not

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,180
really interesting it's just installs

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:55,000
you need probably a USB cd-rom or USB

00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,860
bootable USB stick and install by our

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,230
network but it's not really different to

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,480
normal hardware you just install on

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,280
those machines those are big enough you

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,350
don't need any special tricks that the

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,500
Installer can work they have enough

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:11,590
memory they have fast enough fast enough

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,140
processors the only thing you might need

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,490
to do a mini mall installation or

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,160
something which is probably a good idea

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,650
to not fill up the four gigabyte of

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:28,800
flesh completely in the beginning yeah

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:32,860
sorry to all of the reason netbooks

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,540
support putting by a vile USB yeah I

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,220
have not seen one that doesn't they all

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,160
have recent buyers and you can put them

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:44,140
from almost everything you can lay an

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:46,870
USB cdrom USB just a bootable USB

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,550
installation you can get one on the

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,430
through the booth made with through the

00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:54,790
studio so they put from the just fine ok

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:59,860
and is there some support in 20 opensuse

00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:02,200
to provide a USB memory image i think

00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:05,470
but i'm not sure i think there already

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,050
is one or it's at least it's it's easily

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:11,410
create a ball with TV for example yep

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:13,840
yeah i think the CD image is still just

00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,670
the boot image and then you put you hope

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,650
your network card is already detected

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,330
and then enters the network installation

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,880
you have a happy bunch ever watch it at

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,590
the moment yeah but there's also i think

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,650
there are also there were USB stick

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,240
images around but I I always create my

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,300
own if I need one of them to be honest

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:37,850
it I'm not sure what's this debuted

00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:39,980
no of course not yeah of course I I

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,020
think from with every new distribution

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,080
that we wrote there will be new ways to

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,640
to install stuff so the more this is

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,560
actually a reason the more those

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,290
machines become more common they don't

00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,470
have an optical drive people don't have

00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:58,280
USB CD ROMs or USB DVD rooms ready all

00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:01,820
the time so providing a USB stick image

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,110
that you can just put spoke I'm not a

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,930
product manager but it's something

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:12,500
something useful yeah I will we will

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:14,390
hand this on so during everyday usage

00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,030
there are some totally different

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,090
problems for example you if you have

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,070
installed normally the machine if you

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,140
are unlucky the machine gets detected

00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,810
with its 10 inch screen and every

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,090
application subtly has relatively huge

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,690
phones on the small display because with

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:34,610
a 10 inch screen you have a very

00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,970
relatively high DPI number dots per inch

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:40,790
so the the applications make bigger font

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,460
so that you can read them which is a

00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:46,580
good idea if you have a 22 inch and the

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,890
19 inch monitor to have a similar this

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,720
similar font sizes but on this small

00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,360
machine you actually you want smaller

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,160
font sizes so what do you do you go

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,350
through every application change the

00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,870
font size from ten to eight or something

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,120
like that which is actually not funny or

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:05,780
you go to cheat you cheat with the DPI

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,380
settings either by entering a slightly

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:12,320
bigger screen size in sucks too I doing

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,570
this since years I'm having a as a

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,210
regular machine a 12 inch sub notebook

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,240
and this has always had an 14 inch

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:23,780
screen so this accident then is a little

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,260
bit a slightly smaller DPI rating giving

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,450
it smaller fonts and because I'm a I'm

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,830
nearer to the monitor any way I can get

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,210
more information on it then still read

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,970
it all there's the XR and our PPI switch

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:41,030
where you can on the fly switch to DPI

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:44,240
setting of the of the currently attached

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,799
monitor and but this only works for

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,360
newly started programs I can

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,809
demo it later if there's still time it's

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,999
really funny then there's stuff like

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,529
many people will probably not use this

00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:56,239
as the primary machine they would have

00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,269
this as a secondary machine so there's

00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:01,610
an issue of synchronizing your data if

00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,919
you are when you're on the road or

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,379
you're locked into a into a hotspot

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,559
downloading stuff you don't probably

00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:12,319
don't want to download again at home try

00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:14,240
unison unison is a graphical it's

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:17,720
basically a two-way arcing for all who

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,149
who already knows unison mikvah okay

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,740
unison is basically a two-way are synced

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,500
to old with a graphical conflicts

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,929
resolver very nice should try it not

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,040
only on netbooks but it's good you want

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,230
to have your emails on more than one

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,599
machine while reading them from the

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,169
local miss Poole is probably the old

00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,059
geek way but not the best one anymore so

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:40,639
be prepared to try out new ways stuff

00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,409
like I'm app is pretty usable since a

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,510
few years and actually with most

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,730
old-style medic line you can still use

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,099
it so this is something that if you use

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,190
a central repository for a maze with

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:54,530
IMAP you have to flex or you never have

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,909
a male that was already read as marked

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,460
as unread on the other machine before

00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:01,880
and stuff like that works very well

00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,260
that's something I always had my local

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,510
med school because it's just easier to

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,700
grip but finally when I had more than

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:11,599
one machine in everyday usage as I

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,910
switched to imap for example sharing the

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,430
complete home might be problematic

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:19,339
because there is just too much settings

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:22,180
of the desktops in there it's it would

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:26,690
be nice if it would work but it doesn't

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:28,640
you totally up your que te

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,520
oreochromis settings if you do that

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,720
there's just too much stuff that's

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,770
dependent on the resolution that they

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,270
actually safe in there yeah and to be

00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,970
honest I have given up filing box

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,470
against this tough because basically

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,619
most of those box were closed as yeah

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,750
this is not the really an strange use

00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,299
case you were telling us here and nobody

00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,950
is using NFS home anymore because it's

00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:56,990
actually the same use case

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:58,730
so sharing the complete home might not

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,440
be the best idea create a directory

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,760
where you have the data you need on all

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,880
machines and synchronize that with

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,370
unison that's what I do and this works

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,170
very well when you are on the road and

00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:15,620
you find out that you need to install a

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,960
few more packages if there's enough even

00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:22,190
of space on your machine having an ISO

00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:26,210
image of the latest opensuse DVD or at

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,680
least the cds is very handy because you

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,860
can just install additional packages

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,410
without going to find where have I my

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:39,230
USB cd-rom or without having network

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:41,500
connectivity this is basically this is

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:45,350
especially true because you don't have

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,350
usually don't have optical drives in

00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:55,490
those machines generally saving saving

00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:59,090
resources using KDE 4 and then Firefox

00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:01,610
for browsing the web and thunderbird for

00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:05,560
reading your email is probably not the

00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:09,380
best solution on a small machine because

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,270
you have the Firefox libraries twice or

00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,580
the Mozilla libraries twice once for

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:18,050
thunderbird one for Firefox and you have

00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,820
to hold kde4 so trying to stick to one

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,520
desktop environment in this case is

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,150
probably giving you a better experience

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,820
that's generally the same way we're

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,340
working with older machines i recommend

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,130
okay use IROC gnome or KDE but maybe not

00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,140
concur from within gnome or firefox from

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,850
using KDE if you can avoid it there's

00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:42,020
always the web page that doesn't work in

00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,910
conquering yeah this the last point is

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,460
today not really an issue because there

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:50,570
are no 64-bit netbooks yet as far as I

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,840
know but they will come and if you have

00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:56,030
less than say two gigabytes of RAM there

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,540
is not really a big advantage in using a

00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:01,970
64-bit machine if you're a developer and

00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,540
you know you need a 64 bits environment

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:08,060
okay then go for it but on a normal

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:12,080
normal the end user's machine probably

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:14,210
actually 32 bits the usually the Flash

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:20,090
plugin works much better in 32 bit so

00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:22,100
it's a often and you 64-bit not only

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,780
means that you cannot press more memory

00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,570
but every pointer is double the length

00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,570
and you just you need a considerable

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,010
higher amount of memory without the

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:34,280
Machine doing anything the colonel needs

00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:36,290
more memory so today that's not an issue

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,390
but in the near future that probably

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,670
will be if you have more than four

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,380
gigabytes of RAM of course 64-bit is

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,230
today or even more than two ego bytes

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:49,520
then 64-bit is the way to go but until

00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:51,710
then not really so whatever left

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,020
basically that's what I wanted to tell

00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:59,120
area yeah exactly because their time for

00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:01,970
questions do we have any project with

00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,090
lxde Alexei's the netbook desktop

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:06,830
environment and are there any plans that

00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:10,250
you do anything with lxd maybe have a

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:13,340
USB stick with open susie and alex t on

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,920
top of any ideas i only did a short I

00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:19,700
fruit ever way yeah a short evaluation

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,930
of it and as far as I know I no official

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,880
plans but there's always the possibility

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:25,340
to create a product in the build service

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,940
and I didn't have the time until now to

00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,200
look closer into it and I'm I hope that

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,930
people in the desktop Department will

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,420
look into it but it's actually a good

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,890
feature request yeah okay maybe I don't

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,390
know if anyone's here interested in

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,250
forming a project or talking about a

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,830
project maybe we can meet in a few

00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,450
minutes outside of the door oh yeah yeah

00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,000
first anyone interested in alex de

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:58,970
desktop environment with open Suzy yeah

00:39:47,000 --> 00:40:00,320
you can do ok one moment for me one of

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,360
the most interesting things about the

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,340
new networks is that it's giving Linux

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,200
to people who beforehand would never

00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,390
have seen it certain outs the experience

00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,970
I have among friends and family and so

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,260
on but as wondering if you'd seen any

00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,970
figures and the number of people who

00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,630
take your happy with the standard

00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,740
install or actually do move on to if you

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,290
like a more

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,670
developed you know what I Bunty Aur open

00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,840
suse you something and got do you have

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,670
you seen any figures of the people who

00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,160
stay with the Lin posts for example on

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,830
the on the air sir I have not seen any

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,760
figures I actually noticed but we have

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:38,330
very a huge number of back reports for

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,330
the netbooks and there are also lots of

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,040
requests for for enhancement and stuff

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,880
and so I think there are quite some

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,350
people who say no this is not just

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,610
basically they are used to the

00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,170
distribution they want to use the

00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,240
distribution else on a netbook it's

00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:56,330
probably more the geek type who wants to

00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,010
to replace the mum and dad will probably

00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,369
just stay with the installed one yeah

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:03,680
but I have don't have number story watch

00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:07,400
your experience with the USB CD drives

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,090
because i used the KDE life CD from

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,670
sue's and then my CD drive is too slow

00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,640
so the colonel loses it and then tries

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,470
to refine it and then in the meantime it

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,619
gives a timeout so i can never build a

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,619
live CD what's your experience with that

00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:28,010
I've had never a problem but this is

00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:30,350
probably its device dependent and so for

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:35,150
me they always worked I had different

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:38,720
ones USB CD burns DVD burners and small

00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:41,450
portable ones and also at home I have

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,800
just an old CD Drive in a in a converter

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:48,020
case and for me they all work so it

00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,600
might be bad luck or or a back that just

00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,780
never trigger for me of course that's

00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,850
yeah okay I see time is up so I'll be

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,950
available at the booth later or in front

00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,130
of the door so we can you have questions

00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,130
