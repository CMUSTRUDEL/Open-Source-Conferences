hi my name is Tom I'm from the tools

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,550
team of opensuse and i want to show some

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,680
new project that we started that's open

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,779
face featured packing for community

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,899
features so it's basically k basically

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:42,300
about how to get your features in the

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:45,420
next souza release we are doing a future

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,719
tracking with fates in some years but

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,309
this was just internally and at first I

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,980
want to show you the history and the

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:57,840
architecture of the Fate system and then

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:00,180
the new open fade application and then

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,750
how you get how to get involved how you

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,750
can use it

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:13,180
we are using faith to manage all

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:18,130
features for the open-source products

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:21,130
from Susie and Norville that means drag

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,930
the schema validation of the XML data

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:29,100
that comes in to to query the database

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:34,890
we use the xquery language which is a

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:38,759
kind of SQL very language for XML data

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,729
the database also offers a meter data

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,090
let's for example product data and some

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:50,440
other stuff that the clients need what

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,570
features are versioned that means we can

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,610
see the complete history of each feature

00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,810
what happened and who changed which data

00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:01,680
of it then we have you can subscribe to

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:06,640
notifications on changes on the features

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,790
and it also has depth of server

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,970
implemented to add attachments to the

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,970
features

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,990
that's a big picture of the architecture

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,330
so here this is the part from the slide

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:31,250
before that's the database and all

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,490
communication is happening with XML so

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:40,130
up until now the people inside souza use

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:44,240
the KDE client and we have some other

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,480
smaller programs for example many people

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,209
have scripts that use the database to

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,620
generate pdfs or statistics and we have

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,600
written a KD via plasmid so you can have

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:02,380
on your desktop the latest changes and

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:05,630
the latest features the new part is this

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,810
so this is reachable from outside Susan

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:12,170
we have a schema bridge here that means

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,320
that some internal data is filtered out

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:20,540
and only open zoo the features are get

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:23,049
out and the new application that we

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,890
wrote is the open fade web client and

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:32,060
tagging and voting server devoting

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:35,660
servers and extra server so that also

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,750
the build service can use it sometime it

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:45,140
and it's written in Ruby on Rails both

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:49,780
applications and we have some code that

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:52,430
can just hook in Ruby objects and

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,410
automatically get vote and taggable and

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,410
we will use this for the builders too

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:06,290
that's a screenshot of the KDE fight

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:12,230
client that has some more features than

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:17,780
the web application you can see here we

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:20,450
have a graphical features to show some

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,340
dependencies between features then we

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:28,270
have fields to edit all the data that's

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,270
in a feature

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:37,750
this client also has offline support so

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,810
that the product managers of smoother

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,080
can go to a plane and work on all

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:50,830
features and then save them when they

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,590
are back in the network it has it can

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:58,780
also catch a feature so that we don't

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:03,100
have to load all features every time and

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,260
it can show statistics and also import

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,710
it has a connection to bugzilla so it

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,190
can directly import backs to the faith

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,190
database

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,059
okay the the new open fide application

00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:28,589
should be the central place for tracking

00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:30,629
feature records for opensuse so the plan

00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,649
is that all features that end up in the

00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,869
next suited release are in the system

00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:41,869
and can be seen by everyone and everyone

00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:44,999
can comment on them that's the part of

00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:47,639
which are opensuse feature consists it's

00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:50,959
a title we have some text to categorize

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,659
the features products description

00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:59,389
different actors references to bugzilla

00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:03,029
or to other features or two or just us

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:11,219
then we have the discussion and use case

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:13,050
and test cases are optional views actos

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,330
are we have we have different actors in

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,809
the system that means we have that's a

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,019
rose um you can be interested or

00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:24,869
developer or manager of a feature go

00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:32,869
Percy on roles or something else to do

00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:32,869
something boy actor network protocol I

00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:46,139
think it's just named on my slide like

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:48,289
this okay and now I want to show you the

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,289
system

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,870
that's what you get when you when you go

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:04,390
to the features that opens ooh dioxide

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,260
you can see we have we're generating a

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:10,810
tag cloud you can see the most

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,800
interesting text so it seems we have the

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:18,130
most features mature text for the ass on

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,620
the right side you can see the top voted

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:25,080
features at the moment and the features

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,080
that were updated updated the last time

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:43,110
you can search for features by text for

00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:44,969
example when you search for just we get

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:53,159
a list of features you receive and they

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:57,089
were changed this is was what it look a

00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:00,149
single future looks like on the right

00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:03,689
side you have the devoting applet here

00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:07,169
you can vote what up down or save you

00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:11,459
don't mind I can know what the future

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:16,319
please use the features disco of to you

00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:22,649
also generate some well we don't we have

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:25,349
a statistic you year when you want to

00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:30,469
edit a feature we can simply go here and

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:34,889
find some of the reply to this command

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:38,459
all the text fields use a special rich

00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:41,099
texture in tax so you can do some some

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:45,870
nice format when you and you enter text

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:48,170
here for example you can you can add a

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,170
list

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,860
when you click on add comment the

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
comment could edit and you can see it

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:15,690
it's not saved yet to save the future

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:15,690
you click here it's a bit slower my nope

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:43,240
oh it won't work because i'm not in the

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:46,090
network you have another feature here

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,400
that's the my features link that will

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,130
give you all features that where you

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,630
have clicked on watch this feature so

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,280
you can get a list of the features you

00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:02,080
are interested in and can see what

00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:05,430
changes were there okay I think I showed

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,430
all the features

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,900
the plants that we have for the future

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,670
to implement an open fade that's a

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,800
configurable mail notifications so that

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:27,350
you can get directly notified when a

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,790
feature has changed we will use the amis

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,370
server for this which is also used

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,840
father open to the sides and it offers

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:39,720
to configure your notifications we want

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,750
to add more roles for external people so

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:48,090
that you can be assigned as developer or

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:51,000
infoprovider and can better work with

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,310
the feature and we have to implement the

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,610
attachment feature also for open fade so

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:59,150
you can up and download the attachments

00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,150
that are attached

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,779
so how some here's how to create a good

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,300
feature request that has good chances to

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:18,890
be implemented and to end up in the next

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,660
Susan release it has to be a good

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:25,279
problem description so that everyone

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:28,450
understands what is needed best thing

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:33,589
would be to have a possible solution and

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:36,880
to have as much point us to links

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:43,910
background material as possible so that

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:47,560
the people know what it's about at the

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:52,300
moment only opensuse members can add

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:56,829
create new feature request an open side

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,829
editing features can be done by everyone

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,910
so what can you do with the system you

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,120
can enhance the requests that are

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:16,100
already stored your feedback add tags or

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,200
even help to implement a feature infant

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,620
fade for example you can go to build

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,860
service and prepare something in your

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:30,230
home project and then it will be easy to

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:33,170
to use it another thing is the open

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,140
faith screening team that was announced

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:42,020
on the mailing list we try to get a team

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:46,390
together to screen through the existing

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,390
requests and enhance them a bit

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,630
the most important thing is that you can

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,790
when you go through the future list and

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,690
you see features that you like please

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:06,180
vote for them we will use the modes for

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,360
features as based on what will get

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:14,070
implemented in the next to the release

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:17,340
so until feature freeze that which is at

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:20,580
beta 1 we will go through the features

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:26,520
and look at the maybe top 15 voted

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:30,210
features and will implement them and if

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:34,160
they need to be rejected for some reason

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,160
we we need a very good reason to do this

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:42,060
so and please use the voting for to

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,240
express that you like a feature and

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,420
don't write a comments that say yes cool

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,640
I want this to because this clatters the

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,790
whole discussion and the developers

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,790
can't get a quick view in the future

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,760
ok the the whole system is open source

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:11,950
so it can also be used for other

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:14,360
projects I have the links here yeah

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,930
thanks for listening and maybe there are

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,930
