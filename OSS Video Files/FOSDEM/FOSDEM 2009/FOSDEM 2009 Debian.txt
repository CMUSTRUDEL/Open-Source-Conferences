	00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,240
so good morning I'm out of curiosity how

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,160
many of you have never made me give a

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,160
talk at any other kind of event

00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,670
exciting thanks very much for coming out

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,440
I don't know what the excuse the rest of

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,790
you have is but hopefully we'll have

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,670
something that's at least a little bit

00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,500
you for informational entertaining I'd

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,540
like to start out by thanking the files

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,580
down organizers for inviting me to come

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,910
I had an interesting conversation and

00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,470
Argentina earlier this year with a

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,970
couple of their organizers and some of

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,730
their friends who haven't also be my

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,220
friends and they asked me video why do

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,530
you never come to foz de and I said well

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,809
I've always wanted to go but there's

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,449
sort of two problems one is nobody's

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,670
ever invited me and they need Italy try

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,409
to explain that that isn't how FAR's

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,300
networks and I said no no I understand

00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,909
but there's this other problem which is

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,100
that we always have a big internal

00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,019
meeting at HP that happens at about the

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,090
same time and it's really important for

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,220
me to be there and it's really hard for

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,530
me to be on two continents at the same

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,409
time so I want to thank both the

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,750
organizers for actually inviting me this

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,880
year to come and speak to you this

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,320
morning it also like to thank whoever is

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,380
responsible for the current economic

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,329
downturn since because of that internal

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,430
meetings in my company that involve

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:31,560
travel are not happening right now and

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:36,840
that means I was free to come here so so

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,700
who am i exactly I tell people that I

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,229
made my first personal contribution

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,000
source code to this thing we now call

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,039
free software in about nineteen seventy

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,469
nine there's a little bit of assembly

00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,210
language for a microprocessor system

00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,399
which was pretty obscure back then and

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,549
has been completely forgotten by almost

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,990
everyone except a couple crazies now it

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,090
was interesting because this was a

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,450
little contribution I made by sending a

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,850
typed letter on a manual typewriter to a

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,520
newsletter from a small computer group

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,770
that was based in Hamilton Ontario in

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,860
Canada I was living in Virginia at the

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,020
time and they published my letter to the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,520
editor with you know an explanation of

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,080
how to solve a particular little

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,910
programming problem in their newsletter

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,940
and the club president sent a letter

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,910
back inviting

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,770
to come you know some time and be a

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,320
speaker in one of their monthly club

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,700
meetings and of course the problem was I

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,260
wasn't old enough to have a driver's

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,090
license much less to travel

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,660
internationally without you know some

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,370
kind of support but at very early on

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,200
sort of taught me this lesson that if

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,180
you were willing to do interesting stuff

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,370
and freely make it available for other

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,100
people to take advantage of to use and

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,350
to build on it really cool things might

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,180
happen as a result I've had the

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,640
privilege of working for the hill at

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,850
Packard company and one of its flavors

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,260
going back to 1986 and since about two

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,060
thousand three I've been serving as

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,300
chief technologist for open source and

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,400
Linux and in that context I have the

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,300
opportunity to try and help shape and

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,110
guide HP's engagement with the worldwide

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,550
linux and open source communities and

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,060
that's a pretty cool combination for me

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,590
along the way the reason I'm here this

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,880
morning I suppose and certainly the

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,400
reason that most of you may have heard

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,140
of me if you have is because of the long

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,940
history I've had of involvement with the

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,830
Debian project and you know for the last

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,150
few years I've been serving among other

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,220
things as chairman of the W and

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,640
Technical Community Committee which

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,930
means that back in December I

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,459
surprisingly due to an interesting

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,110
little claws bird in the Debian

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,330
Constitution that I and almost everyone

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,520
else had forgotten about I found myself

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,200
suddenly thrust in the position of also

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,420
being the Acting Secretary of the

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,230
project in the middle of a relatively

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,000
contentious general resolution process

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,360
not really what I wanted as a Christmas

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,630
present but it's kind of worked out okay

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,300
out of curiosity I think I'm correct in

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,459
saying that the currently three present

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,640
or former debian project leaders here

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,500
this weekend I'm not Steve yesterday and

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,420
I know Martin nickel Mars here and of

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,580
course I qualifier are there any other

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,310
project leaders in the audience that I

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,350
don't know her here it's always good to

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,450
know how many people are going to be

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,640
checking your facts

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:29,110
so how many of you in the audience are

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:33,690
registered as WM developers that's

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,690
pretty cool how many of you use debian

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,730
that's really cool and how many of you

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,930
use debian or some derivative we've been

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,690
to knoppix sundress one of the other

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,760
that's a big number that's very cool I'm

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,550
very pleased to have the opportunity to

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,500
talk to you today some of what I'm going

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,630
to talk about to all of you may seem a

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,130
little bit familiar but I hope that

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,310
maybe the perspective that I've

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,470
accumulated over the years being part of

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,270
the project since very early in its

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,220
history and then spending a lot of time

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,960
trying to think about the project and

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,260
how it fits into the larger scheme of

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,050
things in the the open-source ecosystem

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,940
will lead me to have some things that

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,890
are interesting and useful to you but I

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,350
also have to point out that I don't just

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,360
do software things I'm aware as people

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,370
who does sort of have a life outside of

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,500
computers and I've also spent time

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,120
through history is a hobby working on

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,910
things like amateur satellites and

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,860
high-powered model rockets and this is

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,320
what I'm talking about when I say high

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,180
powered model rockets only have you

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,370
applied with you know things like estis

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,240
model rockets the little ones as kids

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,000
and stuff a few yeah many of us did at

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,860
certain points in history well that's my

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,510
son Robert and he and I now play with

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,130
you know these slightly larger versions

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,260
I succeeded finally on my second attempt

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,620
as those of you who watch my blog will

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,870
know in November in Colorado in passing

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,750
the certification test for the level 3

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,760
in the high power rocketry hobby which

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,520
means I'm now licensed to buy and fly

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,280
the largest motors that are available in

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,240
the high-powered rocketry community this

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,400
particular rocket is called a goblin and

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,400
it went to I don't know around 6,000

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,920
feet so that's what just shy of 2,000

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,940
meters that's what it looks like taking

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,110
off

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,060
and for those of you who don't know

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,650
Colorado geography that's Pikes Peak

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,650
just to the right of the rocket in the

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,270
background as it's headed up I have

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,950
video this on my notebook if there's

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,600
time at the end and the Q and I stuff

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,360
somebody feel free to ask me and I'll

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,480
figure out how to show it but I also

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,480
recently had an experience actually two

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,060
weeks ago yesterday from which I'm only

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,230
starting to recover my official dignity

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,750
I don't know how many have you heard

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,970
about this but it Linux conference

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,030
Australia a couple weeks ago the in the

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:05,740
fundraising auction to raise money to

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,760
help try and cure the seemingly

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,260
disastrous disease afflicting the

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,300
Tasmanian devil population I somehow in

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,340
the middle of the the conference banquet

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,420
agreed to let Lena shave off my beard

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,670
for charity and we raised forty thousand

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,590
dollars Australian for that charity that

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,220
night which i think is just completely

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,169
amazing I had no idea what a media

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:34,070
circus this was all going to end up

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:37,070
being the Tasmanian local television

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,560
station sent a crew the newspaper was

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,030
there I have a video clip on here again

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,430
if you really want to see it ass later

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,350
and I'll be happy to show it of what got

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,470
covered on the TV about this whole

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,870
experience two weeks ago today that's

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:57,550
what I look like

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:59,980
I but the funniest part was the email

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,750
from my wife saying please don't wait

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,640
until you get home to start growing your

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:09,790
beard again so I'm pleased to put on two

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,890
weeks today ago was the last time I

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,840
cleaned up after this whole experience

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,410
and and I do have enough to start

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,450
playing with again so anyway enough

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,090
about all that silliness I'm here to

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,790
talk to you about debian it is debian

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,710
well those of you that are using debian

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,500
in one form or another have I think a

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:33,370
very sort of physical real practical

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,700
sense of what Debbie ins product is in

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,860
the form of a linux distribution that I

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,560
think is unarguably one of the more

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,930
interesting software platforms in the

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,180
planet but the more interesting thing to

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,130
me is this notion that I've been talking

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,710
about for many years that the W project

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,960
is really an association of individuals

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,180
who have made common cause to create a

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,500
free operating system and in fact some

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,170
of the most interesting things that I

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,910
think have been observed about this

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,150
whole phenomenon that have gone on to be

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,190
lessons for other people in the open

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,050
source world over the years are things

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,900
that have come about by observing Debian

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,030
more as a development project and in

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,250
some sense as a social phenomenon then

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,920
as just a piece of software collection

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,080
of pieces of software why is it the

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,820
Debian matters well we heard a lot in

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,280
our first keynote this morning about

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,660
this whole notion of freedom and I think

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,240
that one of the things that really

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,870
causes Debian to be differentiated from

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,030
other operating system distributions of

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,610
different kinds is that it really is

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,710
strongly focused on freedom it's all

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,440
about the freedom at the end of the day

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,460
we also want it to be a high quality

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,920
secure useful pretty pile of software

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,250
that the people do useful work with that

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,320
if they can't exercise all of the sort

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,150
of core fundamental freedoms that we've

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,780
come to associate with free software in

00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,889
the process then it wouldn't be w I

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,040
think it's also in

00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,809
sing on that sometimes those who look at

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,199
the project from the outside have an

00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:10,959
interestingly twisted impression of what

00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,549
is really going on there and they have

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,399
the sense that there's something hugely

00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:18,429
dysfunctional about Debian they see lots

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,649
of acrimony on mailing lists and all

00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,839
sorts of struggles and tensions within

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,209
the project I actually have a very

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,730
different view that comes from having

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:33,970
been a core participant in the project

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:37,149
now for Wow 1994 so if 14 and a half

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,129
years or something I see W as being an

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:41,819
incredibly stable and functional

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:45,069
development community there is a huge

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:47,139
non-vocal majority of participants in

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:49,720
the project who just keep doing the

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,269
stuff that they do and as a consequence

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,309
every day there is a new release of our

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,459
unstable distribution with the

00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:58,509
substantial number of bug fixes

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,749
improvements new versions of software

00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:05,470
there's this huge ecosystem of people

00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:08,739
using that software to do very useful

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:12,369
things beyond the aspirations of the

00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:15,279
individual developers and this whole

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:17,679
thing has been working now very well and

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,480
very consistently for you know on the

00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,970
order of a decade and a half I think

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,209
that's a pretty amazing testament to it

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,279
all every time we get close to a stable

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,410
release and we have yet another sort of

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,779
issue that causes us to delay a week or

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,239
a month or a year or however long it

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,249
takes we see you know all these things

00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,769
flying around in the media that you know

00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:40,989
is that being broken is the project

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,779
about to break is this the end of an era

00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:45,939
and so forth and I just don't always

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,709
understand I think sometimes it's a

00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,629
consequence of the fact that there's a

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,850
lot of noise generated by a small number

00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,129
of folks in the project while the rest

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,899
of us are just merrily getting our work

00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:59,230
done and enjoying being part of this

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,299
amazing phenomenon I also think that one

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,910
of the reasons w matter selection so

00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:05,320
many people have chosen to use it as the

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,110
basis for their derivatives

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,460
works is that the project supports such

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,580
a large number of processor

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,880
architectures and has so many packages

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:18,820
incorporated into the main distribution

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,830
in our mirror network and so forth I've

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,660
had the experience personally of working

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,790
with a lot of different operating

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,950
systems over the years and even lots of

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,440
different versions of Linux part of my

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,020
job causes me to go off and install and

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,210
play with other distributions at various

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,890
times for various reasons and there's

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,290
something fundamentally different and

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,480
better about not having to go look in

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,610
lots of different places to find the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,210
extra software that you want to have on

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,590
your system to build a complete solution

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,600
to whatever problem that is you're

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,910
trying to solve there really is a

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,110
benefit to having a set of consistent

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,060
documented policies that are being used

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,400
to drive the way that software is

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,920
packaged and integrated into a cohesive

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,900
system that's not to say that all of the

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,640
packages in Debian or of uniform quality

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,770
I think anybody has ever run the

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,210
distribution understands that no there's

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,420
some real crap in there along with a

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,430
really great stuff but there's a uniform

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,770
process for filing bugs against those

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,900
packages all of those packages are held

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,660
to the same structural standards and our

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,880
plot or run through the same you know

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,010
quality testing mechanisms and so forth

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,320
as part of our release process and the

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,200
fact that the project remains very open

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,120
to new contributors means that there's

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,190
no real reason to go do something

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,560
separate somewhere else you can come be

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,240
part of the Debian project and make the

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,170
thing that you want to accomplish be

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,760
part of this groundwork if you want to

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,550
and finally there is this huge

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,700
downstream dependency chain everything

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:55,390
that Debian does ends up being taken in

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,130
as input to buy a number of derivative

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,560
distributions I mean certainly the most

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,690
visible over the last few years has been

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,980
the Ubuntu distribution but there are a

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,480
number of others that are really

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,690
interesting and one of the things that I

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,090
find intriguing because part of my job

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,700
is to sit as one of the members of HP's

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,560
internal open-source review board which

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,200
is the body that looks at all the

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,190
those interactions between free software

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,160
and HP's product development process I'm

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,529
intrigued at how often some product

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,540
that's embedding a particular piece of

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,340
open source software may be on top of

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,440
windows may be deeply embedded I on a

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,450
consumer product when we look at the

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,670
details of what they're proposing to do

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,560
I start to recognize debian version

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,380
numbers on the source packages that

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,330
they're building things from and so even

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,210
in places where people don't walk in the

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,520
door saying i'm using debian i start to

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,220
realize that this body of work we have

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,160
created is being used and leveraged by

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,410
just an immense number of people doing

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,290
an incredible variety of things all of

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,060
which i hope in the end of bringing more

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,570
free software goodness to more of the

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,420
world this is a plot that I grabbed last

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,400
night from one of the Debian associated

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,260
websites I love to remind people of just

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,570
how broadly internationally

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,880
geographically distributed the

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,680
contributors to the project are this is

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,300
not like one spot per person I don't

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,160
know exactly how this gets created I

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
know you have to voluntarily opt in to

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,650
have your geo spatial coordinates

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,300
included in this plot but if you look at

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,130
this there's a little spot almost

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,140
everywhere on the planet that there's a

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,540
significant population of people using

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,640
computers and software I think that's

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,140
pretty cool it's also cool to me that

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,760
when i look at this plot there are

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,710
certain spots in that map where I know

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,960
that I personally had something to do

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,850
with that because I was the person who

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,589
signed the key of the first developer

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,060
from that country some number of years

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,980
ago or something that's personally

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,900
rewarding but the wrong message here is

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,900
that this is a completely international

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,730
phenomenon in the finest spirit of the

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,720
internet enabled open-source

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,370
collaborative experience I think it's

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,360
also interesting to go back and think

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,990
just a little bit about some of the very

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,279
early moments in the projects history

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,930
part of the reason i like the point to

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,310
this is that one of the things that i

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,320
think has happened a lot over the years

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,450
is other people who want to start

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,820
various open source projects or

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,080
communities when they go looking around

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,640
to find examples of

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,340
things they'd like to emulate or bad

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,680
things they'd like to avoid invariably

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,350
end up stumbling over debian and using

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,350
us as one or the other or both of those

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,240
sources of inspiration I also think it's

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,260
important to point out that some of what

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,210
debian is all about today is absolutely

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,190
stuff that was present in the very

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,140
beginning of the project and other

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,270
things that debian is about today are

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,330
things that evolved and that we learned

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,420
as we went through this whole process of

00:16:53,330 --> 00:17:00,170
evolution as a community in august of

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,090
1993 was when debian odot 01 was

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,970
released i was not part of the project

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,440
then some people assumed that I was but

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,459
I didn't actually personally show up

00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,490
until the time period between the odot

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,640
91 and odette 93 release series but if

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,660
you look at this when ODOT 91 was

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,589
released in January of 1994 that was

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,560
coincided with the publishing of the

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,300
Debian Linux manifesto this is modeled a

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,670
little bit on Richard Stallman skinny

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,200
manifesto was written by Ian Murdoch who

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,690
is the original founder of the Debian

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,790
project and it was it's an interesting

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,920
document in the history of the project

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,530
because it acted is one of the first

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,680
attractors to the project it laid out

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,020
what Ian's values and motivations were

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,420
and why he was starting this project and

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,270
what he was hoping to accomplish and

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,660
many people myself included when we saw

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,240
that document went ooh that makes sense

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,370
that's what I would liked to be part of

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,710
and that caused us to want to become

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,510
involved in the project it's also

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,250
interesting to think about a time in

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,970
history when Debian was being released

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,380
by about 12 people I mean today it's

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,450
just such an incredibly huge phenomenon

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,450
that the notion that there was a one

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,220
person release process and a total of

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,810
about a dozen contributors just causes

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,550
us to stop and shake our heads a little

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:25,640
bit it wasn't until March of 1995 with

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,000
the about 93 our 5 release that we saw

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,580
the first appearance of this notion of

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,650
packages having explicit maintained errs

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,070
dubbing was the first distribution that

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,230
had this notion

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,720
Packaging individual pieces of software

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,090
instead of just you know making a big

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,820
system image that you could install but

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,289
it wasn't actually until 95 that we

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,029
started to have this concept of an

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:50,279
explicit package maintainer prior to

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,649
that if you found a bug in something

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,970
you'd go look at the changelog

00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,250
associated with that package and see who

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,500
the last person was who'd made a change

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,029
to it and uploaded it and you'd maybe

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,649
send them an email and say hey are you

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:03,059
still working on this or are you doing

00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,590
something else right now because I found

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,269
this buried I'd like to fix it should i

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,490
give you the patch to put in or should i

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,139
go work on it and upload it or and

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,759
obviously that worked well for small

00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:14,399
distribution would it would have been an

00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,799
incredibly unwieldy process as the

00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,720
project continued to grow so we had this

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,549
concept of explicit package maintain

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,500
errs and that's Wendy package showed up

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:27,179
for the first time but ama got to later

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,100
that year you notice the release cycle

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,379
in 1995 is a little different than it is

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,120
today but by the time i got towards the

00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,250
end of that year we had deselect which

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,629
was the first of the package selection

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:41,490
interfaces how many of you remember

00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:43,679
using deselect before apt and you before

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,649
apt how many of you use deselect before

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,620
apt was introduced and you live to tell

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:51,870
the tale so did I the amount of time it

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,629
took to watch deselect to go through

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:57,529
every possible package in the archive

00:19:54,629 --> 00:20:02,870
every time you wanted to do anything I

00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:05,129
still loved easily in june of 1997

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,049
another really interesting thing

00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:08,809
happened the project was starting to

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:12,179
grow enough and there were enough people

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,370
who had come to be part of debian that

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,700
we started to realize that not everyone

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,730
involved in the project had explicitly

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,990
come to some agreement about why they

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,299
were there and what they were trying to

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,789
accomplish and we were as it is very

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:29,700
important to solve that that it was

00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,080
necessary for our success for everyone

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,200
involved in the project to at least

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,789
share some common set of values and a

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,710
common vision about what we were trying

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,289
to accomplish that led to the creation

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:44,330
of this thing called the Debian social

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,330
contract how many of you have read that

00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,890
what's wrong with the rest of you

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,480
it's worth reading it's an interesting

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,520
document particularly if you're thinking

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,650
about starting some kind of software

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,240
project yourself lots of other people

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,750
since then have picked up on this notion

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,370
of having an explicit contract defined

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,620
between the participants and a project

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,360
in their user community I'll talk a

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,610
little later about the part we didn't

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,890
include that maybe we should have but

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,930
one of the interesting consequences of

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,430
writing out the social contract is we

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,250
kept talking about how we were

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,810
committing that things would be free and

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,400
the problem of course is that not

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,950
everybody agreed on what free Matt so

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,780
then we had to create a definition the

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,600
WM free software guidelines that

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,080
articulated what we meant when we said

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,000
free and that was one of the more

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,340
intriguing moments in the project

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,130
history because not only did that all of

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,380
a sudden give us a litmus test to use

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,880
for deciding whether certain software

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,400
should be allowed into our distribution

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,320
or not but it was very quickly picked up

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,120
by the folks who ran son site which was

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,670
made one of the major redistribution

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,800
sites in the Internet of that year who

00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,020
said ah this is great we'll use this as

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,570
our definition of what we accept and

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,610
then it also was copied and became the

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,280
basis for what is now called the open

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,590
source definition maintained by the Open

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,020
Source Initiative I have the privilege

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,090
of participating as a non-voting

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,770
observer of the OSI board and I

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,080
understand they're a couple of oh SI

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,060
sessions being held here this afternoon

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,710
I know that there's been some

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,080
interesting tension in the past between

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,570
certain folks in the European free

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,640
software community and the board of the

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,620
Open Source Initiative if you'd like to

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,060
have an opportunity to meet them in

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,120
person and talk to them about what

00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,800
really matters to you and maybe try and

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,970
buy each other a beer or something I was

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,250
going to say beat each other over the

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,050
head but that wouldn't be appropriate

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,170
I'd strongly suggest going by and taking

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:41,000
advantage of that opportunity today and

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,380
then the sort of the last point in the

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,640
early history of the project that I

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,230
point to is the 2.0 release in 1998 this

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,730
is the first time we had an architecture

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,270
or other than I 386 and that's when the

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,370
68,000 ARCA

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,770
she was first supported and that's when

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,480
the floodgates really open once we had

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,120
figured out how to support more than one

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,220
architecture folks like me got excited

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,250
and over history there were five

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,390
different ports the if I can remember

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,460
them alpha spark arm pa-risc and then

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,080
the itanium port that I personally had

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,600
some involvement helping to get started

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,780
and today you know it's just a really

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,760
huge list I think 13 architectures were

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,230
released in our last stable release and

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,710
I'm not sure how many will have him

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,380
money so I talked about the debian linux

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,420
manifesto these were the four key things

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,910
that i extracted from that manifesto

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,950
that I think a worse recognizing is sort

00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,690
of interesting from that era the first

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,790
was this notion that Debian was a brand

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:47,440
new kind of distribution we think about

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:51,710
what was around back then sls what else

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,920
no red heart was not slackware yeah

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,700
early slackware sls what had actually

00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,950
got started almost the the RPM packaging

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,440
system and the debian packaging system

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,140
sort of grew up in parallel debian had a

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,890
packaging system first RPM had I mean

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,170
red hat had a a tool before dpkg became

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,300
really useful the exact history is sort

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,190
of twisted and interesting there's one

00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,740
interesting little conversation that I

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,600
remember being a part of where the then

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,010
debian project leader tried to convince

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,970
the folks at Red Hat that they should

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,620
abandon rpm and switch to Deb and they

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,510
actually thought about it seriously and

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,500
then came back and said well actually we

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,030
should have already done a lot of work

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,370
with this we don't really want to change

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,050
and unfortunately that was one of those

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,790
missed opportunities I think the world

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,010
might have been a simpler place if we

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,620
had one instead of two fundamental

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,830
packaging mechanisms in the linux space

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,000
but maybe that's just one of those

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,510
competitive situations we get to live

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,220
with forever i don't know i think the

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,110
notion that debian was being carefully

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,880
and conscientiously put together would

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,290
be maintained and supported with similar

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,290
care something that's proven to be very

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,280
true over the years it's the basis of

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,660
the will release

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,720
it's ready not on some particular

00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,910
schedule for example the design process

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,500
is open to ensure the system is of the

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,810
highest quality that's an interesting

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,780
correlation the notion that if it's open

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,670
that will help improve the quality we

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,310
had already at that point in history had

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:22,670
the chance to experience the Linux

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,290
kernel communities behavior and had

00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,540
already learned the truth of the

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,030
assertion that with enough eyeballs all

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,980
bugs are shallow but this was an attempt

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,320
to expand that and take it beyond a

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,060
particular software project and into the

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,440
realm of an entire software distribution

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,540
and also this notion that by being open

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,980
it would help to ensure that the work

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,590
that was being done would meet the needs

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,030
of everyone in the user community that

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,950
was of course creates an interesting

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,920
tension over the years what the users

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,620
want what developers want it's not

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,360
always the same thing and I think one of

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,030
the more controversial aspects of the

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,650
manifesto which I suspect Ian's had lots

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,360
of opportunity to think about over the

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,100
years as many of the rest of us have is

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,930
this notion that linux was not a

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,300
commercial product and it never should

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,830
be but that didn't mean that Linux would

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,830
never be able to compete commercially

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm not really sure how we should parse

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:19,130
that today but it's an interesting thing

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,720
to go back and look at if we look at the

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,310
next document that was important in the

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,230
history of the social contract if you

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,090
recall the manifesto is an attractor the

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,520
social contract took the people who are

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,550
being attracted to the project and gave

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,860
them an explicit set of things to agree

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,290
about as a part of the process of

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,780
becoming part of the Debian community it

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,790
reiterates some of that same notion and

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,280
made explicit things which previously

00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,600
had been implicit the Debian itself

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,180
would remain a hundred percent free

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,100
software that's why things like the

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,410
recent general resolution end up being

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,450
so contentious we all believe this we

00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,950
all want this and every once in a while

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,320
we trip over the fact that it's not

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,780
entirely true and we get really angry

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,340
with each other about what that means

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,430
and what we should do about it and how

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,850
we should resolve it I'm really thrilled

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:11,040
that debian has enough weight in some

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,350
sense and has been perceived as being

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,210
a strong enough and steadfastly attached

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,550
to the set of values for so long that

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,470
we're actually able to get other people

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,550
to make changes to fix the problems that

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,170
come up last sep tember the folks at SGI

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,450
relicensed one of the little pieces of

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,250
code that you know sort of his braids

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,950
and everybody's x system these days the

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,040
glx stuff and i was really pleased that

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,500
about two weeks ago we finally got word

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,720
that all of the committee's who had made

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,760
contributions to that code since it was

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,910
originally contributed by SGI whose

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,530
contributions might have been

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,780
copyrightable had agreed to the change

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,290
in license that SG I made last September

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,720
and so two weeks ago Thursday we were

00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,940
finally able to close another couple of

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,160
really old bugs in the Debian

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,290
distribution that had to do with the

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,880
fact that we were shipping stuff that

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,040
didn't meet the W and free software

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,150
guidelines in Maine I'm real pleased

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,460
because that means we won't have to

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,520
remove the x server from the

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,590
distribution I'm really thankful to

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,970
Solomon and the folks at Sam for going

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,980
through the effort they've been going

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,510
through I know that it's no fun I'm the

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,610
guy at HP who gets asked these questions

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,140
and has to go try and motivate lawyers

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,050
to look at things they don't care about

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,210
too and I know how much work is involved

00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,860
the fact that they have been willing to

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,290
go through the process to figure out how

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,260
to resolve this long-standing issue with

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,610
the Sun RPC code is really cool I don't

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,470
know how quickly will actually be able

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,750
to close the bugs in debian because we

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,460
actually have to do some work to account

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,920
for the license change and again to make

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,500
sure that we have a verifiable sort of

00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,850
chain of progress from that license

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,380
change into the code were actually

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:54,600
shipping but I'm really looking forward

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:57,840
to having that clothes and there are

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,190
some things that I think are still every

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,790
bit as relevant about the social

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,870
contract as they were when we started

00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,250
another thing that people don't think

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,930
about very often that i already

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,920
mentioned when I was talking about what

00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:13,350
made debian so interesting is that since

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,630
1994 debian has had a publicly visible

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:18,060
bug tracking system it's not only

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,410
publicly visible it's publicly malleable

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,020
any one of

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,600
you can file a bug against a package in

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,550
Debian any one of you can help to

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,310
perform triage on that particular

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:32,580
problem figure out what's wrong file

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:35,130
comments on those bugs any one of you

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,990
can close a bug in Debian if you close

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,360
it without fixing it will come hunt you

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,570
down and shoot you but the intriguing

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,300
thing is for something approximating 15

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,700
years we've had a system that's email in

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,710
and web out and while there are people

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,990
who work pretty hard to chase down all

00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:54,540
of the span that gets you know into

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,730
various bug reports and so forth we have

00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,340
not had to change the openness of that

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:03,000
process we still allow anybody in the

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,220
world to contribute to the progress of

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,200
understanding issues that come up in

00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,780
debian and in fact anyone in the world

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,670
can close a bug if in fact that bug has

00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,340
been fixed and is no longer there that's

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,440
pretty cool I don't actually know even

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,230
many other open-source projects where

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,530
anybody on the planet can close a bug

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,420
it's an interesting little

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,610
differentiator I think another really

00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,440
important success factor for Debian is

00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:31,290
this process we've been going through

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,120
for many many years of taking the best

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,770
practices that we have collectively

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,990
learned about how to package and

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,760
integrate software and capturing those

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,950
in this thing we call the Debian policy

00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,200
manual the consequence of this is that

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,850
there's sort of a set of standards that

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,380
we can apply to all of the things that

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,850
are packaged for the distribution to

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,400
ensure that they're going to play well

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,490
with others it's the basis of our

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,290
ability to create tools that assist in

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,720
the packaging process and assistant

00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:59,430
checking packages and those collectively

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,800
have led to a much higher degree of

00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,440
quality because things sort of are

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,080
correct by construction instead of my

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,540
you know folks having to discover things

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,100
and repair them it's not perfect if it

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,440
were perfect we wouldn't have nearly as

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,680
many bugs in debian of the variety that

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,450
are easy to fix but at the same time i

00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,580
think it's the only way that we have

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,740
been successful at building and

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,590
maintaining so many packages for so many

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,840
architectures for so long with so many

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,440
different individual contributors from

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,040
around

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,800
old helping with the process after the

00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,230
project had been around for a while we

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,060
started to realize that we had a couple

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,820
of problems one of them was that it

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,520
wasn't clear how the succession of the

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,220
leadership was supposed to happen when

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,380
Ian Murdoch started the project clearly

00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,840
he was the leader of the project but

00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,460
when he for academic reasons decided he

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,140
needed to back away from the project to

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,600
go finish his degree and things like

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,670
that you know there was a fairly

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,130
informal process where he looked around

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,290
and talked to Bruce parens into Ian

00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,510
Jackson and to me who I guess were sort

00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,340
of the three key folks helping him at

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,600
that point with various things related

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,360
to the infrastructure and release

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,000
process and sort of said so what do you

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,950
guys want to do I was at that time

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,720
getting all excited about working on an

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,460
amateur satellite project that ended up

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,370
consuming many more years out of my life

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,950
then I had really expected it to and Ian

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,420
Jackson was very focused on technical

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,790
things that he was trying to work on so

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,850
Bruce ended up being the project leader

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,440
after in Murdock for a while and for

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:38,340
those of you who have been around long

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,560
enough when he got tired it was nearly

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,810
disastrous it was a pretty bad scene and

00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,150
so somewhere in that process we realized

00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:48,750
that we really ought to have some better

00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,250
defined way of handling who the project

00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,820
leader ought to be and even more than

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,350
that we ought to have some mechanism for

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,690
collectively great agreeing on how we

00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,760
were going to resolve conflicts that

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,680
individual developers weren't able to

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,450
resolve by themselves this led to this

00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,730
thing we call the Debian Constitution

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,140
and it's an interesting document to me

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,870
for a couple of reasons one is it

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,820
doesn't really as most constitutions to

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,720
describe goals of the project or how

00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,270
they're going to be achieved it really

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,220
is very focused on how the

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,500
decision-making process should work and

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,200
who has what responsibilities in the

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,760
project and why the other thing that I

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,740
think is really intriguing about the

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,029
Debian Constitution is that it puts

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,059
almost all of the real power

00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:32,799
in the hands of individuals because if

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:34,960
you look at the Debian Constitution

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,789
almost everything that matters that

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,190
happens in the Debian project is the

00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,599
responsibility of individual developers

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,779
working on the things that they're

00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:45,969
working on it's only a very limited set

00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,950
of responsibilities that get pulled away

00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:50,259
from those individual developers and

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,659
handed to one or another groups within

00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:55,359
the project I think that's pretty cool

00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:57,869
it's true that when someone in one of

00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,489
these relatively small number of

00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:03,789
documented important positions in the

00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:06,789
project behaves badly that you know it

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,770
still can create quite a fuss but the

00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,629
fact that almost everything that happens

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,389
or needs to happen on an average day for

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:16,089
people to do useful work in debian and

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:18,879
to get things ready for stable release

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:22,480
and so forth can happen without needing

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,240
permission or authority from some named

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,389
figure is a pretty cool thing and I

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,089
think it maps very well into how the

00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,099
free software world wants to work we're

00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:35,349
not all anarchists but we do have a

00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:37,750
strong sense of individual freedom and

00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:39,940
we really want to be able to work on the

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,470
things that matter to us without having

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,839
a whole lot of stuff in the way between

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,609
us and the work we're trying to do it's

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,909
also intriguing that debian was one of

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:51,250
the first places where the preferential

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,200
voting scheme the Condorcet style voting

00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,079
mechanism was put to use in a big way

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,000
and it's ended up being a source of

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,390
interest for lots of people who worry

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,440
about how voting processes should work a

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,420
substantial number of studies have been

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,609
done of the way Debian votes on things

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,230
over the years and I have to admit I

00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,930
still think that we end up with better

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,190
results from contentious votes than with

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,650
any other system I could possibly

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:18,579
imagine it's been widely studied and is

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:21,279
widely respected so what I learned from

00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:24,160
this whole process beyond just sort of

00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:26,260
observing how the project works the

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,029
first thing which you know and I promise

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,770
we didn't synchronize our thinking

00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:30,970
before standing up to give keynotes this

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,260
morning one of the things that I've

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,630
really learned is that we should never

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,779
underestimate the value

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:41,700
you of values a long time ago not as

00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:44,670
long ago as when I was last beardless

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,619
but it's been a long time HP did an

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,349
interesting thing where they went around

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,730
and studied product development teams

00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:52,740
inside the company that were

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,269
particularly successful and they

00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,160
extracted from them a set of best

00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:58,049
practices which they use to create a

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,450
training program for employees called

00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:01,890
the process of management and one of the

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,500
few things that I remember from that

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,049
whole process of being pawned as we call

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,579
it back then was this assertion that the

00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:10,589
first thing you had to do if you wanted

00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:13,170
to have a successful community or

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:16,140
successful development team was to agree

00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,400
on a commonly held set of values you

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,529
know at least at that point in history

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,710
you know everybody said is talking about

00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:24,569
what the strategy was maybe maybe they

00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,859
talked about the vision thing a little

00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,319
bit first you know where is it we're

00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,569
trying to get to but this notion that

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,990
you had to start off by agreeing on

00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:36,210
what's important to us what are the sort

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,920
of four core fundamental things that we

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,579
believe and once we've agreed on that

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,559
then we can decide do we in fact have a

00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,150
shared vision of where we're trying to

00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,250
get to what we would like the world to

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,490
be like if the things that we're working

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,839
on actually all come to pass and only

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,880
then does it make sense to talk about

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,710
the strategy for how you get from where

00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,049
you are to that place that you'd like to

00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,299
be and from thought to derive a set of

00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:03,450
objectives it's intriguing to me how

00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:06,059
even today many people don't stop to

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,220
think about explicitly that first up

00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,960
this notion of values and I think it's

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,880
incredibly important because through the

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,119
history of the Debian project even when

00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,190
things have been intensely contentious

00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,990
between different subgroups within the

00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,569
project for one reason or another we can

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,400
always fall back on that common set of

00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:26,640
things that we have agreed our shared

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,819
values and find some common ground it

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,430
gives us a way to go okay you know you

00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:34,289
and I may completely disagree about what

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,170
the right way to solve this problem is

00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:38,839
but I at least know

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,579
you and I both care about the same

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:44,000
things and are trying to get to a good

00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:45,770
result when we forget that our mailing

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,950
list get impossible to read for a while

00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,930
but through the long sort of course of

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,880
the project history I think that this

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,680
common set of shared values which end up

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,990
being expressed in documents like our

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,910
social contract provide an anchor when

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,589
things get really stormy and I think

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,640
that's hugely important and it's

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:04,520
something I would hope that other

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,049
projects and other community development

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,599
activities around the world learn

00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:11,119
something from the other thing that I've

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,640
really learned is that an internal

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,609
social contract could potentially be as

00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,740
useful and important as an external one

00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:20,960
we didn't think about this at all in the

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,579
early days of the project why because

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,640
we're relatively small group of people

00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,900
who were all of like mind in so many

00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,420
ways that I don't think it really

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,569
occurred to us that we needed to have

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,890
some explicit code of conduct but this

00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:36,500
is another thing that I think we have

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,540
observed as the project has scaled and

00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,579
as we've gotten to the point where there

00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,890
are many contributors who have never met

00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,799
each other not everybody gets to go to

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,040
the annual W and developers conference

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:50,990
which isn't just a party it's a where

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,849
people get to come together and work

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,099
with each other and live together and

00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:56,420
learn a little bit about each other so

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,069
that the rest of the year they're

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,170
capable of interacting with each other

00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,609
and much more productive ways because

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,020
they understand a little bit about who

00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,000
that other person is and where they're

00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,520
coming from and and what motivates them

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,799
not everybody in the project gets those

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,109
opportunities and so we do end up in

00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:14,270
this interesting situation where they're

00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:16,160
people who sort of have fundamental

00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,589
agreements even if they agree on some of

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,780
the core values of the project they

00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,579
don't always agree on how they should

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,309
most productively interact with each

00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:27,849
other this is something that's very hard

00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:30,650
to retrofit as a change after the fact

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:32,720
we've been talking for years now about

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,160
should Debian also have a Social

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,329
Committee in addition to a technical

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,670
committee we have you know user policies

00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:42,420
for our machines so because those are

00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,799
physical resources that

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,480
it makes sense for us to have some

00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:48,000
explicit code of behavior associated

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,220
with the use of but how would we today

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,770
go back and retrofit into the Debian

00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,990
community some kind of a code of

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,940
interpersonal communications conduct

00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,010
it's just not clear it's very hard to do

00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,290
and as a consequence I think the

00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,329
external view of Debian sometimes is

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,760
accurate that there is this tyranny of a

00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:08,520
vocal minority a small group of people

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,250
who you know are willing to write the

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,260
same opinion a thousand times and one

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,240
email thread end up drowning out the

00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,030
voices of many other people on the

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,160
project I think this is unfortunate it

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,599
does mean that you have to sort of stop

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,309
and pause every once in a while and

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,690
think about the difference between the

00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:26,220
perception you're getting from reading

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,559
the mailing list and the perception you

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,240
would get if you were only watching the

00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,829
list of uploaded packages and the

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,790
technical changes that are constantly

00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:37,380
being made in the distribution so where

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,960
are we going what's the future of the

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,839
project look like well I told the

00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,880
release managers a few weeks ago when I

00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,230
finally sort of had it sinking in my

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,540
brain that I was supposed to come to foz

00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,190
down and do a keynote about Debian that

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,240
I would be completely happy to announce

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,220
the staple release of lenny today and i

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,910
got exactly the reaction that you just

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:02,250
gave me a polite chuckle I'm told it's

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:07,140
really close the last time I looked it

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:09,299
was very very close I think blonde you

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,549
know more things like Lenny happening

00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:13,920
you really shouldn't expect radical

00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:16,109
change because after all it isn't needed

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,170
the project's actually working very well

00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:21,930
I think the dental community is very

00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:25,020
strong it's interesting that when you

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:26,790
have an all volunteer project and you

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,349
have lots and lots of different

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,230
commercial entities around the world

00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:33,540
each donating physical resources and

00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,700
then with for different reasons in

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,920
different places around the world well

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,869
actually really well structured to ride

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,309
through this whole economic downturn in

00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:44,829
fact I think some people as the

00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:46,150
I have less pain work to do they find

00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,519
themselves spending more hours

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,039
contributing to Debian I think that's

00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,509
nice I you know feel sorry for anybody

00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,789
who all of a sudden finds themselves

00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:57,279
without an income but in this kind of an

00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:59,410
economic downturn almost anything can

00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:01,150
happen it's also interesting to me that

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,799
the project continues to attract new

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,229
contributors at a really significant

00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:07,180
rate not long back we added this new

00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:09,369
category of contributor called a debian

00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:12,009
maintainer and I'm kind of intrigued at

00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:15,369
the slope of the curve it reminds me a

00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:17,199
lot of what the Debian developer sign up

00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:19,029
curve looked like in the early years of

00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,039
the project and these are people that

00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:23,109
are doing really useful work for the

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,539
project they're people who are in effect

00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:27,130
man at maintaining one or more packages

00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,719
on behalf of the project they just don't

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,660
have the right to tweak and change

00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,569
anything in the distribution that a

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,920
fully registered w developer has and I

00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:37,119
thought this is really interesting to I

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,069
actually stumbled over this yesterday

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,959
when I was looking for the current

00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:43,869
status of the debian maintainer stuff

00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:45,910
this is a defect density plot showing

00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:48,039
the number of open bugs against packages

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,140
being maintained by Debian maintain errs

00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,779
the interesting thing is I haven't

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,549
actually seen the same plot for the full

00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,499
Debian developers but I bet it doesn't

00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:58,779
look much different I don't think these

00:42:56,499 --> 00:43:00,969
are less capable less qualified or less

00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,199
useful contributors they're just smart

00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:04,029
enough to realize that they don't have

00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:05,949
to go through the whole new maintainer

00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:10,779
hazing process to be able to do useful

00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:12,729
work we also have recently been a couple

00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:14,829
changes in the technical committee I

00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:16,929
won't spend much time on this Anthony

00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,969
towns resigned from the committee after

00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:22,869
several years of substantial

00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:25,329
contribution and we chose to add Wes all

00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,619
day and aren't Don Armstrong there are

00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:28,779
two new members of the tech committee

00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:30,999
they're both very talented guys and have

00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:33,249
already participated quite a bit in

00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:35,410
discussions there we're having some

00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:37,329
discussions about possible changes in

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,829
the working policies within the

00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:40,779
committee a lot of that doesn't matter

00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:42,549
to anybody outside of the project but i

00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:44,410
think the sign of sort of continued

00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:48,859
health and stability within the

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:51,450
community and i really

00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:54,089
we'll be announcing a new secretary soon

00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,220
actually steve macintyre current debian

00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,810
project leader and I as the Constitution

00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,260
requires have been through the process

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:02,940
and have decided who this will be we've

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,650
also decided that life would just be

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,150
simpler if we got Lenny out the door

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,160
before we made the announcement so

00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,710
expect to hear the announcement of a new

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,710
w project secretary very soon much to my

00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:16,710
relief I've talked before in public a

00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,560
bunch of times about how HP contributes

00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:21,359
to the project I wanted to point out

00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,040
that there are a bunch of ways that we

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,380
use debian in a bunch of ways we've

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,690
contributed to the larger community over

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,849
time and really fundamentally it's just

00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:33,510
a great way for HP to stay connected

00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:35,849
with the free software community and we

00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:39,180
use debian in an awful lot of things

00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:40,619
that come out from HP the ways you can

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,320
help the project really haven't changed

00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,609
so many of you are already contributing

00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,260
in one way or another from the show of

00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:48,210
hands I saw earlier that I won't dwell

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,490
on this either but if you're capable

00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,230
committed and want to maintain packages

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,430
or do other work on behalf of the

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:59,099
project we would love to have your help

00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:00,900
finally this is a quote that I use all

00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,819
the time when I'm given talks it's I

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,890
think one of the more significant

00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:07,380
observations over the time that I've

00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,240
been thinking about this from Margaret

00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,859
Mead never doubt that a small group of

00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,140
thoughtful committed citizens can change

00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:15,300
the world because indeed it's the only

00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,040
thing that ever has without I'll thank

00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,730
you for your time and attention I'll be

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,730
happy to take questions

00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:34,740
so if you've got questions raise your

00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:37,250
hand Hollister's gotta mark scope of

00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,250
work center

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,800
are your Rockets baby devoured the

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,840
Rockets themselves are not Debbie

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,850
empowered however the avionics stuff

00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,040
that we fly on them is on the way to

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,590
becoming fully open source and open

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,240
hardware a Keith Packard and Carl Worth

00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,360
and I are currently collaborating on

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,610
some projects if you go to Altus metro

00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,920
morgue you'll see the current status of

00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,980
our work all of the design stuff that

00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,960
we're using is running on debian but the

00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,090
stuff of flying the Rockets is teeny

00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,710
tiny little microcontrollers that even

00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,710
Debian is really not going to work on

00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:22,950
yes over here hi infant friends and we

00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:25,440
have a unity stream which called as an

00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:28,500
industry of integration and national

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,470
identity I know it might scare people

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,900
let's eat these people are using

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:38,310
open-source servers running vegan how

00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,860
does such questionable raises or maybe

00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:43,920
the fact that the new offensive Frances

00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,810
mainly using dig in for a bottle and all

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,600
you can control who does that make Swiss

00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,670
venues well I think it's actually very

00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,890
important that we remind ourselves that

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,200
one of our values is that we think

00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,480
everybody ought to be able to use free

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,910
software and to use debian regardless of

00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,250
what they're trying to accomplish it's a

00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:06,180
very slippery slope if you start to try

00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:08,220
and inject a sense of moral issues about

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,020
other things happening in the world into

00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:13,020
a discussion of how software should be

00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,420
licensed it's never gone well and in

00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,520
fact we ask ourselves the terrorist

00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,140
question from time to time you know is

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,450
this license one that would allow a

00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,920
terrorist to use the software if not it

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,530
fails the Debian free software

00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,500
guidelines it's a kind of strange way to

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:31,830
think about it but the problem is if we

00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,410
allow the political scheme to define

00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:36,180
sort of what's good and what's bad then

00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,950
we all have the potential of ending up

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,480
on the wrong side of that definition at

00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,630
some point and that's just not

00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,630
acceptable

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:51,010
another perfect summer but there's

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,440
somebody I gotta have a Hello first I'm

00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,810
really happy to meet someone made

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,480
getting to be such a successful project

00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,920
so then shall lots of people here that

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,090
you should thank for that not just me

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,250
but yeah my question is what is your

00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:10,840
relationship that I've been to project

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:13,240
and it open to change your your internal

00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,460
philosophy our way of working in the

00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,500
billion project you know it's an

00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,030
interesting question the way you ask it

00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,790
is particularly interesting because no i

00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,340
don't think the existence of ubuntu

00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,810
really change any of debian score values

00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,540
of the way that we work inside the

00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,910
project my personal impression is that

00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,660
the relationship between debian and all

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:36,880
of its derivative distributions is

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:39,100
generally good but a situation where

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,170
various details go in one direction or

00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,960
the other at any given time there have

00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:46,480
been some spectacular examples of places

00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,160
where someone maintaining a package in

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,600
debian and someone working on that

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,610
package in the boom to have had

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,680
differences of opinion about the right

00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,810
way to do something and in some cases

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,850
over time one of them has come to

00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,410
understand the others physician better

00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,870
and has changed their mind in some cases

00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:04,240
not so much but there are awful lot more

00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:07,090
places including you know in my own

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,660
personal experience where folks in a

00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:12,850
boon to or in zandru's or nepotism thing

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,130
various other derivative distributions

00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,900
have come and said we thought about this

00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,340
we think there's this other thing you

00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,680
could do in this package that would

00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,090
enable another kind of use of your

00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,490
software that you haven't thought about

00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,050
and have offered a patches and those

00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,610
patches have been believe fully

00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,560
incorporated and have become part of

00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,810
debian so i think the thing that's

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,630
changed if anything is how we think

00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,910
about sort of the debian community in

00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,770
the size of that community i've used the

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,990
analogy that if you think about debian

00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,850
as being sort of a town you know there's

00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,560
now all sorts of suburb sprawling out

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,290
around the town and we have to make sure

00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,380
the center of the city you know is sort

00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,820
of lively and active or the

00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,830
cord eyes out and we go through the

00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,290
whole mess that lots of cities around

00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,760
the world have gone through but in the

00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,130
main I think the relationship between

00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,720
debian and most of its derivatives it's

00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,850
been really quite positive over the

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,740
years I think it enhances the whole

00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:09,890
experience for everybody that they exist

00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:12,420
and do what they do other questions I

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:16,830
can't see where fastest I'm sorry I have

00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:19,350
to just jump up n oh here we go I I work

00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:22,440
on the project upstream from debian uber

00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,030
repackage our software only the way you

00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,160
repackage it is sufficiently different

00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:29,600
from what we do and what we document

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:32,160
that users can get pretty much confused

00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,840
yet they read our documentation using

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,590
debian and it doesn't correspond to what

00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:41,690
they see or vice versa that makes for

00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:41,690
quite a support nightmare what they do

00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:50,100
and okay their arguments that say your

00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,390
way of doing it is better on their

00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:57,210
arguments to say oh it is but yeah my

00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,630
suggestion is would you do this as you i

00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:02,550
know you do without various packages

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,290
shouldn't your developers at least get

00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,540
involved upstream make the case and

00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:09,120
perhaps come to something more unified i

00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,700
think the difficulty anytime you have a

00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,920
project that's as large as debian with

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,560
so many pieces of software packaged by

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,500
so many individuals is that you get a

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,840
huge range of behaviors and relationship

00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,700
styles and so forth i personally have

00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,560
worked very very hard over the years

00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,000
particularly with some of my

00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,310
counterparts in the police software

00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,260
foundation to ensure that the versions

00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,300
of the packages that i'm building of

00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,220
some of their software that go into

00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,350
debian or as close as possible to the

00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:40,680
upstream versions as they can be because

00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:42,840
i have that same issue in same concern

00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,660
there are a number of other places that

00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,790
i think are very well publicized and

00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,410
documented where that hasn't happened

00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,390
sometimes it's been because there have

00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,880
been fundamental technical disagreements

00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,250
about how software should work in a

00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,770
distributed environment versus you know

00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,410
the gem

00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:02,170
reality that an upstream wants to

00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:03,760
include sometimes the motivations or

00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,100
reasons for those differences have not

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,930
been nearly as Noble and at the end of

00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,940
the day I think you know I certainly

00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,940
have this opinion that Debian ought to

00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,830
either be shipping software that's as

00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:17,230
close as possible to what the up streams

00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,940
are doing or that we should be engaging

00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,860
with the up streams to understand why

00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:24,130
not and to come to you know clearly

00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,540
understood agreements about why is our

00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,010
stuff going to be different and should

00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,810
it have a different name because it's

00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,180
different or you know what's the right

00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:32,710
way to accommodate that you know there's

00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:42,130
no one-size-fits-all answer

00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:45,190
unfortunately yeah it's about the riddle

00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,440
of the future shall new caramel's to run

00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:50,950
out the cool epson like what about a

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,980
hard tutorial or weapons laura started

00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:55,750
running on the day been well i mean

00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,210
debian is interesting because we have

00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:01,690
already got communities within the

00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:04,320
project working on the use of the bsd

00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:07,240
kernel and the use of the herd with

00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,700
debian userspace packages the

00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,610
velocipedes looking at combining debian

00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,640
user space and opensolaris kernel and

00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:17,800
libraries there are licensing concerns

00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,750
in that particular case that i don't

00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,170
pretend to be the ultimate authority on

00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:25,810
but my sense is that it's perfectly okay

00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:27,730
for people to take the debian set of

00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:31,030
Debian packages all of the Debian user

00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:33,100
space and combine it in any way that the

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:35,590
legal sort of interpretation of the

00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,180
licenses allow with other kernels and if

00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,890
they end up building really useful

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,410
results for themselves and others out of

00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,330
that that's great I have to personally

00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,120
admit that at the end of the day I'm not

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,160
sure why the world really needs so many

00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,770
different kernels that differ in such

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,180
small ways if somebody comes up with a

00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,210
radically different way of thinking

00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:57,460
about structuring software that's cool

00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,960
but a bunch of kernels that I'll do

00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,700
pretty much the same thing with tiny

00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,069
little differences I don't get very

00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,839
excited about

00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:06,339
I think we're getting close to the end

00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:09,459
of our time there any more questions huh

00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:11,229
yep I think we will cheer up its up by

00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:12,789
other lots of people getting right we'll

00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:15,459
be around the rest of the weekend feel

00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:20,279
free to try and spot me I don't hide

00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:20,279
