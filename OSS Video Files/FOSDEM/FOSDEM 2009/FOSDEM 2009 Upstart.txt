Description: 
	By Scott James Remnant

This talk takes a trip along the Roadmap for Upstart 1.0, introducing what features will be available.

Linux has always traditionally lacked good service management facilities, so much so that the typical daemon doesn't use what ones we have and instead relies on hokey shell scripts.

Upstart is being developed to not only solve this problem but also how it, through integration with D-Bus, DeviceKit and similar frameworks, allows service lifecycles to be tied to hardware and system state.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
