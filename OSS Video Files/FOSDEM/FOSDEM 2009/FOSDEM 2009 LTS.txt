	00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:15,920
ok hello

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:22,610
here so early so I'm going to

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:32,660
on the dinner to last maintainer let's

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:38,260
see if this works oh so you know Tillis

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:41,780
is a TLS or SSL library till s an SSL or

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:45,559
mutual ex girl it's their acronyms for

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,159
for the same protocol ssl was invented

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,629
by Netscape long time ago and

00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:55,489
standardized within the ITF stls there

00:00:53,629 --> 00:01:01,940
has been some changes in the protocol

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:06,229
but not not very large changes so t

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:11,119
resist security protocol used in HTTPS

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:13,100
which you may be familiar with so can

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,820
you tell us is like openness yourself

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,539
but the philosophy is to to strip away

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:25,250
all the non TLS related stuff like

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:28,700
s/mime like low-level crypto Agnew Telus

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,179
doesn't provide r.a.s encryption or

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,759
similar it's just a TLS library and so

00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:38,840
hopefully ignite Ellis will be less

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:42,259
bloated an open SSL still it would be

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,369
nice to make things more modular but but

00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:49,850
at least it's smaller than openssl the

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:56,649
x.509 stuff like ocsp is not supported

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,649
either i'll talk about this later so

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,909
so you know terraces part of the group

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,660
project protected by stole mom's GPL

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:13,890
shield and the copyright is assigned to

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,430
the FSF so they can protect us in if

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,819
there are some problems in some some

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,569
company takes in ateres inputs in some

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:27,300
product and doesn't follow the license

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:31,980
so they're loud core libraries the

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,430
lesser GPL version two dot one we have

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,220
been thinking about moving to lgpl

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,310
version 3 but a lot of dependent our

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,630
reverse dependencies on new Telus test

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,450
that still are using lgpl V version two

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,040
dot one so it will probably take some

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:56,370
time before we cannot edit the cool

00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,290
library or the tools and the surrounding

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:07,320
utilities are under the gplv3 lighted

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:12,810
QTL nutella's dash sí allí the command

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:15,810
line interface there is also an extra

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,380
library in keynote els called in hotels

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,769
lib canoe tillis dash extra which

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:29,000
contains some right now it contains

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:31,829
minor things like l Seto compression and

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,170
it used to contain more things but we

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,260
are remote things from it to use the

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,920
container openpgp authentication but

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,410
that has moved into the lgpl port so

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,850
said my orit of the libraries lgpl

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,850
person to that one

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:57,349
so no tell us depends on Varna co-sleep

00:03:52,230 --> 00:04:00,390
decrypt for low level encryption in

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:03,450
latest stable branch it's possible to

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:07,409
replace lib G Krypton our / encryption

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:12,000
algorithm basis so if you want to plug

00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:14,989
in your favorite implementation of a s

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,699
that's possible or if you want to use

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:22,949
hardware-assisted encryption that's also

00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:27,630
possible we're using lube tasin TASM one

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:33,050
for a someone parsing it's a very small

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:37,289
library written for ignite LS it's i

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,930
believe it's below 110 thousand lines of

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:46,380
codes which is very small for a on one

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:49,430
library and that's required for the

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:54,330
x.509 parsing it's not used for any TLS

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:59,240
protocol parsing for compression there

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:03,389
is we support lipsett and lib lso

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,520
actually in the el sol Seto compression

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,760
is not standardized for t less so it

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,400
some non-standard extension but we

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:19,110
support it for for experimentation anime

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:25,380
that's part of the gplv3 version 3 extra

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:30,570
library there are bindings for guile the

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:35,760
igneous extension programming language

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:38,520
and c++ the C++ libraries or rappers are

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,960
not heavily used I haven't seen any

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,650
large projects use them yet hopefully it

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,610
will take up

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:52,430
and there are some unofficial rappers

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:56,180
like Python as well I haven't used them

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,759
myself they are out there as far as I

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,660
know there are no polo binding so if and

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:06,800
one near so pearl hot girl there's a

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:13,280
nice project for you and there's also a

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:18,530
windows installer built using the minguk

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,800
cross cross compiler and the msis

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:25,070
installer which are very nice tools to

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:33,830
create Windows programs from from Linux

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:35,810
environment so some history about

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,400
commute or less it's eight year old

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:45,460
project Niko's wrote it initially and

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:48,860
was the maintainer for several years I

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,260
maintain it since I think 2005 or

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,380
something like that because general

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,810
Niko's didn't have enough time to to

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:02,500
work on it and echoes is still around

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:07,460
and is the largest contributor today

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:11,210
besides myself there's our fairly small

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,020
development team over the time 15 people

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:18,050
have been contributing patches to New

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,260
tillis large patches so they had to sign

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,810
copyright papers for their for self

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,630
that's fairly small number of people so

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,210
if you're interested to work on our

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,530
security project it's a good chance to

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:38,650
join the team so this this graph is from

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:42,320
bolo on the code size so fairly stable

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,720
increase of code I'd like to reduce that

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,979
code at some point but still this

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,810
another but curve to just increase and

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:56,520
another way to increase the code would

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,819
be to mobilize things further

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:07,680
that something will do in the next

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:08,849
branches oops so another goal with

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,370
dignity less is to have good

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:14,879
documentation I talked with a lot of

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,729
open SSL users that are frustrated with

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,930
lack of documentation so cygnet Ellis

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:24,330
has good there's a texan for manual

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,750
which can be read like just a user

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:31,949
manual or programming manual there's

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:35,610
also the gtk dock interface used bike

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:42,180
gnome for documenting libraries used by

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:44,880
GT km g lib so we put a lot of energy in

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,040
in making things documented and if it's

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,709
not documented it's not supported

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:55,230
officially so so everything that is in

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:57,270
unity lists has good documentation so

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,820
some of the features you know in New

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,980
tillis which you might not be familiar

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,930
with you of if you are familiar with the

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,550
laces to that supports openpgp

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,320
authentication so you can use your

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:17,550
openpgp or new piggy key to authenticate

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,040
yourselves to a server and vice versa at

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,339
the server can use AG new people new PG

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:27,420
key to authenticate the server to you as

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:30,690
a user and it's a interesting feature

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:37,770
that I hope will be used more there's an

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:43,130
Apache module that supports it so all

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:46,290
the features there's support for srp

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,029
authentication which is if you are not

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:55,440
using certificates but want to use a

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:58,260
password instead you can use SRP it's a

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,190
good way to authenticate TLS sessions

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,370
with a password and another Telus

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,690
extension that has been published or

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,750
standardized relatively recently psk

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,820
it's it's TLS authentication with

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,720
pre-shared keys like if you have a

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,870
static AAS key or desk key you can

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,330
authenticate the channel using that key

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:27,890
another feature in nautilus has been the

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:30,050
server name extension which allows you

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,090
to use multiple Tyler servers on the

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,810
same IP address which has been a problem

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:39,560
in Apache with mod ssl for a long time

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:42,410
that you have to use a unique IP / ssl

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,900
site it's still of course you need the

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,990
supporting the browser's but recent

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:52,190
Firefox and Internet Explorer supports

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,190
it and can you tell us also includes x

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:59,000
49 tools so you can create certificates

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:08,210
see a sign them and our certificates

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,220
requests and so on oops so also working

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,470
with the new tool s is challenging from

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,350
a patent point of view first of all the

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,950
entirety last protocol is patented its

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,450
patented by Netscape a long time ago

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,630
fortunately they are not doing anything

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:32,060
with their patents so it's possible to

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:33,860
make a free implementation of it and the

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,420
orsay of course has been the historic

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:41,860
problem with the RSA patent but there's

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:46,940
always been free implementation of RSA

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:52,220
available hours a patent has expired so

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:56,690
it's no longer a problem yes our SOP

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:59,210
patent is patented by Stanford they are

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,280
actually released at as a free pattern

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,300
and encouraged free implementation of

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,420
its there are also some rumors about

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:12,460
other ikan speak patterns that may apply

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,589
to the srp technology so some

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:20,000
organizations are concerned with using

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,089
SRP I know that well as Nicholas builds

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,089
disable all the

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:28,920
syrupy stuff in it and there's also an

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:32,790
authorization extension for TLS being

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,329
defined actually it's been through for

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,730
lost calls in the ITF and it hasn't

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:42,990
passed so far there is a law school for

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:45,509
it right now and it might pass this time

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:51,170
there is a patent on the technology by

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:54,089
their draft authors and it's not clear

00:12:51,170 --> 00:13:06,870
whether that license is free enough to

00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:10,290
be useful okay that I have some time

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:15,319
left so I can take some questions if

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,319
there are any yep

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,360
I think the library isn't going like

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,240
they say it's mostly tools and examples

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,780
and self tests there's a very large

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,680
self-test part of nutella's and I think

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:44,940
that's big part of it I'll believe the

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:51,950
library itself is below 100,000 so two

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,950
auxiliary code yep more questions yep I

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,030
I don't have the license from Stanford

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,160
ready or clear in my head but they have

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,590
been encouraging for implementation and

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,110
there have been supplying the community

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,610
with an implementation of srp under bsd

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:19,200
license as well so it looks like

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,150
Stanford is not going to sue anyone but

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,600
of course this is a patent area so you

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:27,090
never know what happens to patents the

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,430
srp patents that's more problematic is

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,190
probably they speak or ich patterns

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:35,580
because they are owned by lucent or some

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:38,610
other components and but then I is a

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,440
problem thinking of whether the that

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,380
patent applies to this a Soviet

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,620
technology or not and that's that's

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,160
lawyer territory so it's it's difficult

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,790
to answer but i believe the stanford

00:14:49,160 --> 00:15:00,050
patent grantees is fine that's the best

00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:00,050
we can hope for and more questions yep

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:12,019
yeah so so we have have I think five or

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:19,880
six security announcements for dinner

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:24,290
tell us and some some have been ok I can

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,440
answer that in the break thank you very

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,440
