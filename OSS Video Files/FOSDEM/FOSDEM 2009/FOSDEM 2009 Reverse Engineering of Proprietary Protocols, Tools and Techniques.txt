Title: FOSDEM 2009 Reverse Engineering of Proprietary Protocols, Tools and Techniques
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2009
Description: 
	This talk is about reverse engineering a proprietary network protocol, and then creating my own implementation. The talk will cover the tools used to take binary data apart, capture the data, and techniques I use for decoding unknown formats. The protocol covered is the RTMP protocol used by Adobe flash, and this new implementation is part of the Gnash project.
