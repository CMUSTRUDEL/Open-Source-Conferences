putting up with the delay taking a

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:23,279
conference as usual so talking it's

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,710
about theming and you started looking at

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,029
what we actually want to do for Lincoln

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,129
is dead we have to do as far as I could

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,320
see three main groups of people who

00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:37,949
actually interesting you're being single

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,350
is there some of the people who just

00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:42,989
don't like wave next step in your step

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,690
books that's a fairly cruciferous group

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,640
on their mailing lists others are the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,010
people who want to have the new step

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,409
applications running on other systems

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,739
blending in with the native of the field

00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,809
and some other people who just want to

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,830
be able to play around have different

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,830
things that they can look at

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:11,120
so myth feeling I wanted to meet all

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:13,040
three of those groups desires so I

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,120
started off with looking at what the

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,880
main basic design objective should be

00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,050
these of use firstly for the end users

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,330
that people who are actually going to

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,350
use the applications are wanting to look

00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:30,290
particularly away secondly to the theme

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,880
developers if we're going to get a lot

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,920
of people developing things living

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,490
instead you have to make it easy for

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,040
them third the software developers need

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:44,900
everyone to be a huge overhead to make a

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,790
software compatible with in then lower

00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,190
down on my objectives are the obvious

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,990
things the things actually have to work

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,310
to do the journey now how to fast enough

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,810
we have to be able to maintain all this

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,810
planning a life anyways

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,630
so how do we make it easy for people to

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,850
use we make it a standard well define

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,619
package something they can easily copy

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,650
from place to place you don't have any

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,030
problems installing we provide an easy

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,670
way to select a bit so just play around

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,370
trying different themes available we

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,980
make the mutt date incident so that

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,930
you're running applications to change on

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,380
the fly you don't have to stop and start

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,410
applications will change things and we

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,270
need to provide a tool so that people

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:41,730
can actually tweak those knees and play

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:45,540
around with from the designers point of

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,740
view you've got to have some use away

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,310
from them to build the things that

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,490
really has to be a very applications no

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,320
successful alternative nowadays again

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,570
they need to instantly be able to see

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,700
what the changes they're making to their

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,050
thing due to the way their application

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:07,320
appears most things perfectly should

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,070
need no coding so it should be good for

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,600
a designer who isn't a software someone

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,360
who's actually good at the artistic side

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,920
of it I can put together a thing without

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,730
having to write any additional code

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,709
sometimes you do have to write

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,290
additional care though when we do that

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,390
we need to support firstly because you

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,130
want to make sure the Dragon version of

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,810
you are executable is loaded into the

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,750
system

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:38,220
and one of the ways we're looking at

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,190
doing things is my entire images onto

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,250
individual controls so you at the out of

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,040
individual pictures and to do that we

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:53,140
need to have a nice simple mechanism to

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,360
define those tiles I chose to use a

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,470
single image and divide each other so

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:06,880
your design your button design which

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:09,400
part of it are going to get wet and for

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,400
the developer we have to keep the number

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:17,170
of methods to a minimum to get it soon

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,820
that's a lot harder than it sounds we

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,160
need to put as much code into the GUI

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,140
library to make it standard built-in as

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,560
possible so that the developer doesn't

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,070
have to rewrite it wasn't me

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,889
and we organize things and clean the

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,040
simple way with related stuff written

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,040
together and we'll try and document it

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:48,600
so how do we actually decide to do it

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,610
well it's going to be a slow incremental

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,150
process of getting feeling working

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,310
perfectly is that just part way there

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,100
really so we need to build a theme

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,229
engine and the tool to design themes in

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,630
parallel so there's as you develop one

00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:07,110
feature when the beam engine you've got

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,120
tool to try to allow this we need to use

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,830
much of the existing table for

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,970
functionality as possible and that's

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,229
actually quite a lot of in this day we

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,479
need to design in from the very

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,010
beginning instant switching between

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:27,380
things dynamic update and we just use

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:32,570
the ideas from chameleon that's a thing

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,570
engine produced by the air 12 project

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:41,300
basically their concept was toiling for

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,490
it defined rectangles defined the images

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,620
that fill those rectangles and have

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:51,080
various controls in the GUI draw

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,690
themselves using this rectangle to Tyler

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,220
left top corner bottom right corner

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,800
living things in between and we had to

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,110
provide thing methods that a code that

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,930
can actually override so that they can

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,270
say right I don't like the way this is

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,090
drawn by quality I'm going to do it

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:17,120
completely differently okay the existing

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,510
theming stuff in this step has pretty

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,850
much always provided system images but

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:28,580
things like the arrows in menu items

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:31,280
icons for five buttons for when your

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,280
mental note from a file system that kind

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,390
of thing so we can use reuse that

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,090
mechanism the new feeling ABI what we do

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,840
is we replace the named system images

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,550
that are built into the system with

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,410
versions from particular theme and when

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,460
the theme is deactivated you just

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,460
referred to the originals

00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:02,560
system covers much the same system

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:05,949
images the opens that API provided a

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,169
color list which lists named covers that

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,539
the system in use so it's has something

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,300
saying highlighted control control has

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,580
been highlighted and where our control

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,539
tours itself it looks up one of those

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,120
colors binary all we do replace that

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,460
colorless when our theme is activated so

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,259
that newcomers will be used for a

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,000
restore the list by the things

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:34,180
deactivated we always deactivate the old

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,919
thing before activating a new one and

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:43,930
the voids coefficient system fonts again

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,180
the new step API provides a whole list

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:51,639
and standard bombs by name and standard

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:53,440
font size from uses those to decide how

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,740
text is going to be displayed in the

00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,430
various different contracts the user

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,490
default system specifies which name maps

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,719
onto which actually font and ridiculous

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:11,490
lies we could have a theme change all

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:16,460
that sort of stuff haven't done yet

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,810
and as interface style that's a

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,800
mechanism that was introduced by opens

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,520
that many years ago to control the style

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,139
of the interface they used it for

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,389
changing the style of applications

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,750
between next step and makes them running

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,419
on Microsoft Windows and it's a simple

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,940
mechanism where you tag several

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,959
different style names for different

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,660
behaviors and when you set a particular

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,720
interface file for it control then that

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,240
control will draw itself different

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:56,010
hard-coded drawing mechanisms in there

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,500
to do the different look because it's

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,630
only lets you switch between well

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,100
defined spiders are already built into

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:08,490
the low-level library it's too limited

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,000
for general feeling but we can use it to

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:16,050
switch between standard behaviors such

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,710
as menus next let menu is a vertical

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,810
many other

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,590
will be appears top left corner of the

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,020
screen my cos menu appears for way

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:30,210
across the middle of the screen and

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,210
windows value appears within a window

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,890
the use of default system in open step

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,980
is a really major component weakness it

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,890
allows you to define a database lots of

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,790
different information that includes

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:55,850
fonts colors or less it's tough but we

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,850
can extend it to add more behaviors a

00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:02,430
default to control whether we have the

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,900
applications draw the window decorations

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,120
in the top bar wins over for winter by

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,030
camping or whether we let the window my

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,060
agent it we can actually use that to

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,220
prepare all sorts of detailed individual

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:22,800
behaviors if we decide we want our

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:26,460
particular base so what's new in a new

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,410
thinning system well when you say any

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,540
color is used by from trouble

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,730
individually rather than using the

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,390
system colors risk so we've got more

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:41,690
fine-grained control we can set the

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:45,270
interface device fun for the individual

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:48,690
controllers and parts of control now

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:52,080
that's always been possible by the

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,550
default system but using the default

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,060
system is can be convenient

00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,130
nice Peter sir have trouble doing it

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,810
they don't know what defaults they can

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,690
set they don't know the possible values

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:08,550
that there are so having the theming

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,899
system do that simplifies your geometry

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,950
setting Tyler majestic news for a

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:18,430
control that's totally new with adopted

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,610
from the chameleon cleaning system and

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,240
of course overriding the individual

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,769
methods used to draw so to control

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,329
instead of throwing yourself by using

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:34,600
low level mechanisms as a standard part

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,850
of the drawing model will use specific

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:45,370
methods as a part of a cleaning system

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:47,890
instead so time ye jism already setting

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:53,320
this wrinkly and then troops of up to 9

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:56,019
years we can have say two rows of three

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,020
images some columns of three images or

00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,899
even just for images but up to now me so

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,730
that would define her rectangle with top

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,010
left corner top right corner bottom left

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,570
from the bottom right corner then the

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,360
image in middle you could be time

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,510
repeatedly to fill however wider control

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,709
this which in the middle on the vertical

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:21,930
axis with detailed to fill up the border

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:26,350
on the logic control and the middle part

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,810
is either time of repeatedly to further

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,940
control will scaled up to lure control

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,520
or just emitted because this is

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,170
something that you're going to draw in

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,899
the middle part with something else on

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,720
your enemies and times of the border so

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:46,149
that concept of the metrics at nine

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,680
youjizz really works for a relative draw

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:50,509
critical changing standards simple

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,610
control is not made of Allah Muhammad

00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,310
it's something's maybe with other parts

00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:00,860
obviously you have multiple sets of tile

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,779
images for each of those sections yes we

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,279
use a single image by the information

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:11,360
that the idea is that we actually let

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,920
people design a single image and let me

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,069
do that in any sort of drawing package

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,259
and produce a nice-looking image for

00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:21,410
what they want the thing to look like in

00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:23,740
the long run then they go into the

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,470
feeling application of that image and

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:32,269
specify where that sliced up into nine

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:37,300
sections so that makes it easier to

00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,300
design note the nine parts of the time

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:46,620
right end user the installation music

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,480
defaults are two ops fury it's actually

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,029
quite simple as that have been using

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,779
user defaults you just set the user

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,490
default to specify the theme moment but

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,970
who wants to do command-line stuff like

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,370
that so what we did is we extended the

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,709
info panel but called the new step

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,779
applications you is pretty much there's

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:11,730
a standard mechanism within the API for

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:14,310
creating an info panel so all we do is

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,250
extend that standard mechanism so that

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,899
shows apparently at the bottom of the

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,930
list of all the other information about

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,329
being an aggregation clicking on the

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:28,560
name of that thing brings up the thing

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:31,950
under which is your the icons of all the

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,690
themes on the left and lets you select

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,459
on an individual and sort of a click on

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:40,800
individual being to selected once you've

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,630
selected the thing it displays the

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,459
information back to who the author well

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,440
as when was with any any other

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,449
information that the author wanted to

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,220
put in there and those are obviously

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:54,839
changes where your application looks

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,720
there's also a button on that come over

00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,399
lets you make this selective being

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,399
visitor fault for your application

00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:11,130
the Attic that's the design application

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,500
it should be useful to tweak things

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,660
because we wanted to be that nice and

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,870
simple people who just want to mess

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:23,100
around with it but mostly it's designed

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,960
for the actual feet design of the person

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,870
who's going to write a theme from

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,110
scratch it's going to put new version is

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,190
of various different problems and then

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:37,650
systematically changing colors and light

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,110
so it has to provide easy ways to

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:43,560
replace the system images to specify

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:47,550
replacement color colors to set the menu

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:53,460
style to set the decoration behavior to

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:56,940
set in also individual information if

00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:01,170
the GS beam class actually built into

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:07,290
the fury library the library users for

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:09,630
drawing the basic class is responsible

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,000
for handling loading a new theme from a

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:16,050
bundle that includes loading in your

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,830
executable code if you're overriding

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,840
individual methods to draw things get

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,630
it controls the switchover between

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,420
beings that processes deactivating one

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:30,240
theme of activating the night it handles

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,280
all the actual changes listen

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,470
introducing the new system colors and

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,750
the new images and changing the music

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:42,690
evolved and it provides methods to

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:48,120
obtain all the different resources that

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:50,460
use to draw your controls and it's

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,590
designed to be efficient that uses load

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:57,480
on demand caching nothing in there not

00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,310
one of those big resources line images

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,150
are actually loaded into memory unless

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,280
they used they learn they used that

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:11,550
cached they stay in memory for the

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:16,520
duration that's a Miss active and look

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,520
out for them especially extremely quick

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:25,919
the activation process again we start

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,559
off when we activate a theme by sending

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,769
a notification to say that the thing is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:36,090
going to activate that allows anything

00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:37,769
else in your application to do any work

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:43,620
it needs to do to handle anything

00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:46,289
activation so some of the fury classes

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,419
will observe that notification will

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:54,240
change the way they behave when they see

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:57,090
anything being activated but also use a

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,009
phone can handle that so if an

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,460
application wants to be able to deal

00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:05,539
with feeling more intelligent worthy it

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,830
can use the notification ice to do that

00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,809
once we said that notification to play

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,879
we're going to activate anything we

00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,639
changed the user to help database system

00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:17,809
color sis colleges we change the current

00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:21,240
theme which is a global variable

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:25,169
essentially so that everything in use

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,879
this new thing instances new magic we

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,490
update the main menu of the application

00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:30,870
because that's kind of complicated bit

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,269
where we have to reel with nice when men

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,070
you ever changing from a horizontal

00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,690
layout to a vertical layout I don't

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,690
think

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,730
and we send another notification telling

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,860
everything that the activation has

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,590
completed and that's that's the point

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,210
where all the windows from redraw

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:52,610
themselves going to take on the new

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:54,799
girls duty activation is pretty much a

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:58,360
reversal that with sent a notification

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,360
to say that you're stopping

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:08,350
let's trap remove all the images remove

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,230
the four agreements and revert to the

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:14,080
original one which might be or will

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:18,970
generally be the built-in 1 i'm the same

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:23,039
notification to favorite completed right

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:27,340
i put in a whole section on this because

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,770
it is an important detail don't override

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,610
the default system when we introduce a

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:35,409
new clean almost all of this standard

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,090
theming mechanism all the old stuff

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:43,720
certainly is controlled by the user

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:51,159
default system we avoid overriding what

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:55,870
anyone else is set so we set our new

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:57,429
default in default domain that's a

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,030
bottom of the list that looked at

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:03,130
consulting last I don't know if

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,370
everyone's familiar with the process but

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,890
basically you have different domains

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,480
that you set defaults in and you have a

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,700
list of domains and when you want to

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,230
look up the value of default it goes

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,330
from the list finds the first match so

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,160
match is produced by the themes are

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,549
always the last matches and someone else

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:28,410
and tweak things in a setting individual

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:34,630
reversed I don't know if that's the

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:38,530
right decision that's the way we're to

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:42,010
learn okay low-level drawing spoke of

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:46,720
things this is a whole new section of

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:50,770
the GS big master we provide utilities

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:55,750
to do is like tying a rectangle drawing

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:58,530
borders from the central part all the

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:02,080
sort of basic drawing functionality but

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,030
you need to use within your feet methods

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,410
if you're going to be writing a theme

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,049
and you're going to be overriding

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:13,929
individual methods this is the toolkit

00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:16,470
of things to do simply drawing you can

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:21,390
always use the very low level a div an

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,390
SBC a path but any stuff but

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:31,790
simpler name API for the veining if

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:41,320
you're going to actually implement the

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:41,320
new controls in the theming system it's

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:52,580
nothing we have a list of methods that

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,100
are essentially designed for drawing

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,680
specific conference so for instance the

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,170
button has a few methods that allow it

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,880
to draw yourself using the leading Fei

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:09,320
rather using the regular mechanisms we

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,170
override those in somatic tap it lets

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,380
you add new code to your thing that will

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:19,220
override those methods under control

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,470
scorns focuses so these methods use the

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,580
tiles the interface styles and the

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:29,740
images that are provided by the standard

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,740
feeding mechanism and

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,490
if none of those overrides that that

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,440
you've seen things like the tiles aren't

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,269
there the colors aren't there are some

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,090
thing it's all just falls back on the

00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:44,090
original hard-coded the new steps file

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,279
franklinton named items are a fairly

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,350
important concept in there really exist

00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,879
on this it's not enough to change the

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,539
look of all the controls of a particular

00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:59,549
class the reason for that is that a

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:02,190
particular class of control is used in

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:04,200
different contexts buttons for instance

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,120
I used throughout the system and you

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,769
won't necessarily want the buttons to

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,970
look the same everywhere that they're

00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:13,919
used the ok button in your open panel

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:17,460
maybe although came up and want to look

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,799
different from those other buttons the

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,690
way we handle that is the including

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:28,110
control so the the open panel for

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:31,320
instance when it creates a button in

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,350
itself it also can assign a name to that

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:40,169
but basically it registers that name

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:42,139
with the current theme object that

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,299
allows the theme designer to then

00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:47,730
provide resources specific for that

00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,330
individual button rather than all

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,330
records

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:59,630
right current state of development okay

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,559
the framework exists it's useful you can

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,390
create things with the application the

00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,150
system only justice colors interface

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,630
file information all that old stuff is

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:15,679
there built into that the immune system

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:19,960
easily set up the GUI library controls

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:24,830
need to become converted to use the

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,290
drawing with methods from 13 API to use

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,970
the named items and named covers and may

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:34,880
the tiles currently NS button and espera

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,730
espera you are all switched over to

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,110
using the theming API but this plenty of

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,740
work still to be done on other

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,740
controllers

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:51,440
I suppose ons menu really is controlled

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:55,810
by the API as well so the look of the

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,570
main menu controlled we need volunteers

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:02,120
in future we need first of all people to

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,970
actually start using this to divine

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,850
designs and vice things partly because

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:11,290
we want to have some nice things partly

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,290
because that will share any shortcomings

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,170
we need to continue the process of

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,970
looking at the individual curry controls

00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,390
that hadn't really been cleaned yet and

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,510
to find the methods that we're going to

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,190
use to draw those these will be the

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:32,150
methods that are added to the current

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:34,490
evening API and we need to obviously

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,430
update those controllers to use those

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:42,110
makers update the thematic application

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:44,900
to support those changes we should

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,510
support settings system fonts there's

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,670
not been any culprit yet as I'm sure at

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:53,920
some point in the future people will

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,920
want and I think that's the end

00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,530
now

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:04,010
the obvious thing to do at this point is

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:04,010
to try and demo somatic

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,210
you

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:32,500
I have my screen here probably killed

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,500
excellent Twista

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:44,100
spotter water and yes I should will that

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,100
not be sized screen again

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,840
sorry

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:58,300
all right that's what thank you so I had

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:06,520
40 this don't have an adapter for my

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:08,940
confidence of the projector it's good ok

00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,940
let's try

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:26,360
start the ematic application ok I can

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:32,000
create a new theme what you see when you

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:36,080
create seen if first of all is your your

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,840
main window for that theme editor up

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,840
here we have system colors

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:55,440
that's quite straightforward it's not

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:58,030
the most anyway the system colors

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,700
inspector lets you select which system

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:03,730
color you want to change and then you

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,490
can use a color well to pick a

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,110
particular system cover same so the

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:17,400
control highlight color might have

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:17,400
changed to two yellow naughty

00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,060
chillin

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,600
it's in the East inspectors setting a

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,050
red background color through what

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:37,160
controls pretty ugly them illustrate a

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:41,940
point then we have the system images

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:44,880
that's inspector you get all the

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,420
different standard images so you can

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:54,960
find the image you want to change that

00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:57,390
one and double click to get upper an

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,770
open panel to select the image if you

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,870
actually have one on just you want to

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:06,540
replace it then you inspector lets you

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:11,750
for instance select between menu styles

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:16,159
so we have a horizontal menu bar avatar

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:20,880
we have a vertical menu power again

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:23,640
further constraints for a horizontally

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,580
from strengths in more sense what

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,890
happens if we're more menu items in

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,790
screen I have the faintest idea to be

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,080
honest child and Beth Beth I don't know

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,340
we've had that for quite a while and I'm

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,740
not actually come across that in

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:44,190
practice we had a discussion about what

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:46,260
we were going to do before in Windows as

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,050
we've just recently added Microsoft and

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,520
style in window menus and of course

00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:56,010
windows were a lot shorter so it's

00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:00,120
actually a real problem in that case and

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:02,030
we're quite likely to have menus where

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,380
the number of items when fit across the

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:12,050
width of the window I think what we

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:14,190
decided to do there is have a submenu

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,720
produce that the right hand side if

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,120
there were two it was too little space

00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,270
so you can click on that submenu away

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:27,170
get vertical menu for extra items but

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:29,430
that's not yet in terms windows

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,340
decorated native they were decorated by

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:36,330
thing unfortunately that's the one thing

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,520
that it doesn't yet work immediately on

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,950
the flying you have to exit from the

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,770
application again the reason for that is

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,600
because the window decorations that is

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,230
tied in with the back ends as well as

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,420
the front end theory library and we've

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,340
had to change all the back ends as well

00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:57,320
as changing the GUI to implement that's

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,320
of us going to take a little time

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:07,130
final one along here that's

00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,470
miscellaneous stuff it's where you set

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:12,830
who's the author any additional

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:19,580
information you want something change

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:28,280
the icon of the thing just quick close

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:29,930
that one and open the existing now and

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:35,390
suppose to ricardo's this what he didn't

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:38,150
want me to show this no but it's an old

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:40,670
person that this windows theme I'm

00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,860
actually I brought me modified its

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,510
original so he's not even responsible

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,840
for all of aesthetics fact is I didn't

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:55,030
have anything didn't have time to knock

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,030
up anything myself so and

00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:05,240
I lost it you're watching you approach

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,240
it

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:22,529
so now I just have me too okay so here's

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:26,460
a an example of a an image setting the

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:30,450
timing for it if you watch the button on

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:35,520
the main menu as I change the position

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:39,150
that I cut this immature it has the

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:42,679
viewer in symmetrical and it does in

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:45,899
this at the moment the backend API

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:52,610
doesn't require it to be symmetrical but

00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:52,610
the thematic application does

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:07,460
anyway see the effect of changing these

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,710
positions basically we're drawing the

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:23,870
board around the outside in this button

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:29,090
using this image as well this we don't

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:32,289
have that yet I chose them yeah I should

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,289
go back to

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:52,460
so realize I just went along the top

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:57,890
they have system colors system images

00:33:52,460 --> 00:34:01,100
menu window miscellaneous the rest of

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:07,220
this space and they like Christmas space

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:09,919
here this area is perfect other GUI

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,100
controls the idea is you're going to

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,560
gorman edit climatic and just drop other

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:20,179
controls a PSO then we've got a button i

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:25,250
right in here fox the scrollview we've

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:28,369
got obscure aliens now if you click on

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,100
one of those feelings that becomes up

00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:36,100
with a whole lot of different options

00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:40,100
but first of all this Tyler you can

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,520
control click on there and you can

00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:46,240
select an image to use for timely the

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,909
intersect

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,790
in the case of the scrubber different

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,919
named items here so to scroll the down

00:34:51,790 --> 00:35:01,810
arrow is one of those named items that

00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:07,150
is specific to the scrubber so just let

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:09,340
go down arrow and they select a

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:13,390
different color to the scroll the down

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:21,100
arrow there you go only effective throw

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:29,650
the damn i could also set different

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:31,300
color pants brother horizontal norm so

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,670
you can customize each individual

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,840
control set the tiles to provide and set

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:45,090
the colors you can set options if they

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:48,730
have them this one does build about that

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,650
well that's good so we can have on

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,810
Arizona the same into the scroll bar

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,450
chloride is attending a spell upon

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:59,870
which i'm adequately protect a good

00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:02,360
question yeah are these hallways or back

00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:05,300
or are disappointingly phone then not

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:08,930
okay in fact the Ricardos one that we

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,330
just looked at was not a fake okay so

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,130
you can have our part ladies were you

00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,890
can have alpha in the comments on you in

00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,500
the future Oscar you have an infection

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:23,950
in your future trip from start the

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,950
custom border yeah you go do it now

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:36,110
because the final thing is coach you

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:39,410
actually want different code there are

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,890
various things you can include in your

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,330
character in extras that you need so if

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,310
you want to add common methods that are

00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:50,000
shared by different methods within your

00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:53,510
being or include extra non headers for

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,540
instance we are going to be doing your

00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,790
windows thing which would want to use

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,140
the window streaming API which means

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,560
we're going to need to include their

00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,560
headers

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,230
global variable declarations additions

00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:13,500
to make file to build so but there's one

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:16,590
of your actual theme methods for button

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:21,090
in view with a particular style / in

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:23,940
particular stint so if you click on it

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:26,369
it for that you get up a template I feel

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:31,110
it just invokes the superclass

00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:33,930
implementation these template methods

00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:37,380
are all went back to all these settings

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:40,500
if the magic are defined in property

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:45,000
lists text property listing files in

00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,500
diplomatic application so most of adding

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,540
a new control is very easy you just

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:54,750
change those txt files but anyway if for

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,960
instance I want to put some more code in

00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,960
here

00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:13,850
seema maybe I won't bother 48 eternity

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:18,040
maybe if I was to go into here and click

00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:20,480
on Doug if any way it would

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:28,520
automatically compile that and put it

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:33,200
into the theme I don't be kind of on

00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,270
today look you all know me so I offer

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,770
anyone climbed over some gradients I'm

00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:41,690
pretty finder back home we don't have

00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,610
gradients and patterns in there we have

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,710
just just colors and we have tire limit

00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,460
just serving it it's how a young should

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,380
be very using it to enjoy every day not

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,420
necessarily I'm afraid it could be

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,790
implemented using a tiled image or it

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,020
could be intimately Heritage's and

00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:01,220
provides a method to draw the gradient

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:06,290
some point in the future we might have

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:08,690
gradients as an option controlled by the

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,930
user default option but we haven't done

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,930
that yet

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:22,790
they got probably really about covers it

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:25,700
questions what happens if you enter code

00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:27,680
invalid code and creatively out of

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,030
interest then it will give you a

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,030
compulsion error

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:48,700
mouse is a bit sense to contact

00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:53,350
sensitive so if I just enter some

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,710
rubbish there hopefully yeah will you

00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,710
get that

00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
Oh

00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:10,840
because you can delete if you've made a

00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:15,910
mistake that's kind of this or get back

00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:24,130
against somebody try to provoke the

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:30,460
community no that's probably a good idea

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:33,340
to do but I would be nice wikimedia guys

00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,380
we love the new scheme who they are for

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:40,030
them yes I don't actually think there

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,380
are very many convenient things yet at

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,980
least two or three men which is locked

00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,350
Logan we having to wear proper things

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:57,660
before being married like it I prefer

00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:57,660
all of those arms up into town right

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:10,869
anything else more questions I have no

00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:21,130
idea all the time I've only been over 20

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:24,609
55 well no those seem to be compatible

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:30,579
for a dollar seeming ancients what they

00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:32,260
use so how nice place okay the way the

00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,480
other way we're going to notice things

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:38,049
compatible with other theming engines is

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,990
to actually get in a write code base

00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:43,569
things okay most of this is designed on

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,010
the assumption that what we have using

00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:47,819
the application is a theme designer

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,890
someone who's interested in graphics and

00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:53,859
artistic and there's a lot about coding

00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:57,540
product if we want to integrate with

00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:57,540
windows which we do

00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:05,430
kte or something like that then we're

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,340
going to have to use their native theme

00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:12,090
engines and the way we have to do that

00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:14,160
it's to go into the cove level to use

00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:17,640
their fee vengeance we win from within

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,920
our bed so we can use we can use do that

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,530
in two ways if it's reasonably possible

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,900
we can use their fee mention to draw

00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:30,660
into our views directly so to directly

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,760
controls where that's not possible

00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,850
because bet the engine just doesn't work

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,760
that way what we can do this is the

00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:42,180
theme engine to draw into a background

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,900
window and then take the contents of

00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,330
that window as an image pixmap and use

00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,570
the tiling mechanism to draw that within

00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:53,880
our things with our vault is where

00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:56,460
roundabout way hopefully we don't ever

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,220
have to use that with it but it's a

00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,830
fallback option instead so yes with the

00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,150
intention is to write some things to

00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,150
look like an assistant

00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:12,650
essentially wants to keep the developer

00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:16,309
API very simple at least methods

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:19,160
possible but at the moment I'm only bank

00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:22,989
only implemented say Batman would scroll

00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:26,959
bars and pants yes how do you envisage

00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:30,219
keeping it simple as well as I mean go

00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:33,349
to the control specifically made of well

00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:36,380
it's you any but like a zoom checkboxes

00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:39,109
and radio ones and they all have their

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:43,789
own combo boxes and other one of their

00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:47,209
own we need methods well no I hopefully

00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:51,259
most of them won't because actually most

00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:55,369
of those things are implemented pretty

00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:58,339
much as buttons and can be drawn very

00:43:55,369 --> 00:44:01,519
easily using the timing mechanism so the

00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:07,489
vast majority of cases what we already

00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:09,289
have will do the job what we have to

00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:11,150
look at all the more complex employs

00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:13,339
like we want to hold panels both

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:18,219
containers your browser so it varies

00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:18,219
buttons and things to behave differently

00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:28,109
one possibility because of the nature of

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:30,090
objective-c is that we never provide the

00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,730
amount for that very very big complex

00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:39,510
controllers directly all we do is say

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:41,550
you had a mechanism to replace a class

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,800
of control class drawing that falls

00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:49,710
itself with a subclass that's completely

00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:53,130
different over Hills so we could add a

00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:56,580
simple API just to effectively replace

00:44:53,130 --> 00:45:03,510
the class with another bush for those

00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:07,109
controls so that should keep it lettuce

00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:09,270
people here and that we've got generic

00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:12,780
stuff that should work very well simple

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:16,940
all the simple no troubles then we've

00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:19,349
got a simple mechanism for people to

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,900
override very complex pond filter that

00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,180
really needs to be done completely

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,550
differently

00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,980
and what we really aiming to do is keep

00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:30,020
down account of methods handling those

00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,609
controls which are on the mid there in

00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,660
the middle that don't really fit into

00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:39,740
either at those two extreme capsizing

00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,809
right so your your check boxes and radio

00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:45,349
buttons will have they'll use the draw

00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:48,829
button on methods for themselves Russell

00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:51,349
they'll had a giant image or at all

00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,240
right well recollect it somehow with an

00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:55,520
active parameter or well well they

00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,980
already use system images for instance

00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,140
the checkbox noises are so they have

00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,579
made they have names images already just

00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,920
pick the image replace it in your thing

00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:09,619
before on chat box changes its behavior

00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,589
before named human just then type of

00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:15,800
theme and leave the battlefield is in

00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:18,800
the mother plan almost every probability

00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,349
of this teach because so many items are

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,930
bundles yeah that everything like the

00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:29,200
window button so that's the point where

00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:29,200
the image with accessory yeah

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:41,730
