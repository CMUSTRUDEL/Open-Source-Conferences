okay so my name is Martin gosh i'm

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,540
working for Susan since nine a half

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,660
years ago I guess and welcome to fast

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,609
2009 why we are here so Fossum is quite

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,160
important for us in my opinion is the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,020
most important developer conference in

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,900
Europe maybe even in the word for

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,630
opensuse at least so we are here the

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,640
first first time now and novellas

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,949
sponsor again so we sponsor the whole

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,100
event so nobody is not that evil we are

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,290
supporting open source again we have

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,840
approximately 30 people from nowhere

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,309
here or from Suzhou so you see a lot of

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,370
people here running around with

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,079
contributor t-shirt and if you don't

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,940
have a contributor t-shirt and you think

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,210
you should have one please go to the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,579
booze and we will give you one we have

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,710
20 talks this time we have three talks

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,719
from the community from the community

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,809
means people that are not working for

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,039
novell or for Souza so I don't want to

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,870
really make a difference because of

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,689
course we are also part of the community

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,340
even we work for the company but at this

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,549
time you have three different talks from

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,010
the community directly we changed also a

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,750
little bit the booze we have not only

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,390
opensuse there we have the opensuse

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,000
education project there which is a

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,880
cooperation with HP which is pretty nice

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,700
and we have Martin wearing here for the

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,829
embedded build service stuff so you can

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,479
also ask questions about that and well

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,390
it's not on the slides we have opensuse

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,259
studio here or Souza studio excuse me so

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,170
if you want to build your own

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,180
distribution just go downstairs which

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,159
the big monitor and you can build your

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,439
own Souza based distribution with your

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,320
own package selection very nice we have

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
also dvds and use P sticks with us so

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,220
you can just burn it or put it on the

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,220
USB stick and take it at home

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,300
we had some changes unfortunately cool

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,320
lewis sick so the second talk was

00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:06,380
outlook 211 dot one so this talk will

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,210
not happen Marco said you want to do it

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,740
but unfortunately I cannot reach them go

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,610
i'm not sure if you really have the next

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,040
talk he's coming ok nice at some cars

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,390
doing a keynote unfortunately it's a two

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,000
o'clock when we have one of our

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,980
community talks but anyway if you want

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,960
to see Sankar talking about a little bit

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,709
more general about opensuse what hap-

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,610
opensuse project join him as a main

00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:34,640
stage at this time this was free funny

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,470
men yesterday try to get all the stuff

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,270
in the car for the first time we have

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,160
much much better video recordings

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,350
because now we have microphones and we

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,000
have speakers what you see so the

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,790
recording should be pretty good this

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,870
time as the video was the last year was

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:54,080
very very good things to you and Tom but

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,520
the audio was not that good and here we

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,260
have a smaller room so it's the same

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,370
room at we had last year on the second

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,440
day so probably we have and the evening

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,239
the problem was air so if the talk is

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
over please open the door so we get some

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,459
air here and and so organizers asked us

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,220
here is really a hundred people limit so

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,510
if every seat is taken we have to close

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,220
the doors and nobody can get in

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,260
otherwise we get really problems or

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:24,799
better organized I got problems so let

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,580
me go back and see what we had last year

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,549
so 2008 was the year of the releases so

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,760
we had 11 dot 0 it was very very

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:37,190
successful if we had sixty-four percent

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,670
more downloads compared to he live 10

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,590
load three and I in my opinion the

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,180
eleventh of 0 was really a milestone in

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,730
release especially because of the new

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,530
super release so package management was

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,280
really really fast and really really

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,890
good and we spread it around 25k of

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,959
promo DVDs in two months usually I need

00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,090
for that six months and this was so

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,620
successful this time so you just needed

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,050
two months wait six months later

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,400
released 11 dot one and this time we had

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,890
only five percent

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,829
download more downloads and the question

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,540
is of course was a bad timing it mean it

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,489
was the week before Christmas it was

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,130
only a six months difference between the

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,130
versions and in my opinion is really

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,430
that a it was too short before the

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,539
year's end and second it was 11-0 is

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,729
rock stable so many users don't see the

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:33,860
need for updating 211 dot one I guess

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,570
and of course you have to build service

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,449
if you want really the greatest Katie

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,800
for example you don't need to install 11

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,330
dot one you just can go to the bid

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,940
service and install the latest packages

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,419
also on 11 dot 0 so it's not really a

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,919
problem anymore to skip one distribution

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,850
but anyway a five percent is not a bad

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,250
and although reaction to the eleventh

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,800
series it really rocks especially the

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,120
package management everybody said this

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,630
is the best thing you had in the last

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:08,270
five years so 11 odd one pretty good so

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,520
what adds to be achieved in 2008 we

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,530
started with forums many people wanted

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,820
forums I'm not really a big fan of a

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,910
former I think mailing this is much

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,919
better to handle but anyway after six

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,919
months we have over 20,000 people in our

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,199
forms which is pretty good I guess a few

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,760
weeks ago we started features opensuse

00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:31,430
walk Tom will make later a tomorrow a

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,229
presentation about it so we can finally

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,030
you can get features into opensuse and

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,060
not just if you're working for the

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,880
company we starting with a config

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,419
repository we also have to talk about

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,130
this from Hannah a little bit later we

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,930
have the first elected board which is

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,210
pretty important for me so the first

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,930
part was appointed by novell so this is

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:57,349
a really bored to community want which

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,539
is also nice he's not here it's the

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,260
explosion of weekly news so we can use

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,030
obviously as it's a newsletter where we

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,909
can put all the news in it which happens

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:10,729
a Europa zoo the world and in the last

00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,590
month's we saw that they are coming up

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,979
many translations so it's available in

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,750
German Japanese Hungarian whatever so

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,940
pretty nice demons are working very good

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,780
together if you want to join them just

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,400
go to the market

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,200
mailing list and you see the need

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,520
information there and this is also well

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,620
directly in contact with so we can use

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,660
as a marketing team so finally we have a

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,270
marketing team we have a marketing

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:42,680
mailing list so we try to to combine our

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,450
efforts with the other guys yes we had

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:51,410
the first external release party in

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:53,330
Nuremberg so now a new year started so

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,610
what is missing for me the most

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,040
important thing in the open zoo world is

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,810
a spokesperson program if you're not

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,330
aware what the spokesperson programmers

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,570
we want something similar if it all I

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,940
have they call it ambassador we use

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,610
spokeperson as a placeholder we are not

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,050
sure what kind of name you want to use

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,530
obviously it would be better if you have

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,150
different names in fedora or ubuntu but

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,100
we would see at the moment there's a

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,479
voting running so if you are opensuse

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,729
member you should already you see if the

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,190
mail and you can vote for the final name

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,260
we will release the final name on

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,600
Wednesday on Wednesday is the next IOC

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,750
project meetings so you can see what the

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,940
final name is and why we have to do that

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,090
we want more local groups we want more

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,820
support from local people and for me a

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,260
better distribution of DVDs which cause

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,450
it's really a pain in the ass to

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,600
distribute DVDs to foreign countries

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:51,979
it's not working postal services are not

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,320
working some people complaining about

00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:58,340
that translations are missing especially

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,350
on the main pages on the start page but

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,930
also on news opensuse walk or software

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,479
opens or so if you go there today it's

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,820
only in English some people argument

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,770
okay if you can everybody should be able

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,080
to download opensuse even it's only in

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,910
English but in my opinion it would be

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,830
nice if you also translate these pages

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:20,510
so you're working on that contributions

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,190
so we started with the country

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,860
repository and henne we'll talk about

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,300
later a little bit more about that and

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,220
so it's important that you can get stuff

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,280
into the distribution so it's not only

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,190
souza base only people from the company

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,099
can

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,930
contribute to that this in my opinion

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,260
very important otherwise we are not

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,060
really a community distribution some

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,310
people also complained about trademarks

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,790
so if you make your own distribution for

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,140
example with TV or with Susan studio you

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,750
have the problem what's the name of the

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,240
distribution can i call it opensuse can

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,310
i call it based on opensuse how should I

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,740
call it so we are working with to

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,780
resolve the trademark issue and in our

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,990
idea of course it would be best if we

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,170
have something with opensuse because you

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,210
should chose this is based on opensuse

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,770
but it's not that not that easy because

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,730
there's a legal stuff of course and

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:16,440
washed and what happened right now we

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,740
have no idea when we release the next

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,560
product and so we really have to rethink

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,680
the whole reschedule stuff so we are

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,720
they are more than one option of course

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,910
for example should we release in a

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,280
static release cycle 6 months for

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,520
example should rerelease just once a

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,470
year should we do some smaller updates

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,490
like kernel updates on you goodness in

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,140
between so this is a very interesting

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,230
discussion at the moment and the problem

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,960
is at the moment nobody knows what to do

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,470
so I cannot say when the next opensuse

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:58,350
will be released there are one option is

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:02,430
for example September but we will see so

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,340
that's all so I'm already over the time

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,760
a little bit so you see it's a lot of

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,590
stuff is going on in the opensuse world

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,810
maybe just a little bit about for stem

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:16,200
we have a boost its downstairs it's the

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,900
same location we had last year go there

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,880
talk with the people I try to bring all

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,560
the people who make a presentation after

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
that to the booth so if you have

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,940
questions please follow them to the

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,620
booth and ask them you have to chance we

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,230
