okay first thing what is agnostic

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:22,550
application project the most application

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:25,520
project you see that you are at that non

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:30,640
commuters odd it's not reasonably

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,640
autologic Pacific been around since 2002

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,230
currently it under the process of the in

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:41,149
transition to put the new project after

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:43,820
the question just kind of sad so you

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,370
want me and I harder that you're better

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,430
this and we are making we're sorting

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,380
things out balaji was flicked up to 32

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:57,020
and decide which part go into a footlong

00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,940
new project in which will remain on you

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,620
which still means open source of

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:07,759
problems just not under the cannula and

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:10,670
probably to change the name you can find

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,790
us some time zone around IFC channel

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,799
which is that just because we didn't

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,619
like the noise on mr. time now the

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,090
Gloucester channel is so silent that we

00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:23,990
don't have the noise not anymore but

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,139
technically it is useful because people

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:31,189
sometimes expect to ask questions and if

00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:32,920
it finds an ally retraction im Welling

00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,939
said

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,970
go to the most application project to

00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:44,350
fill the gap which use the pencil lack

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:48,520
of applications because canoe steph has

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,310
many users so it's such an ex extended

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,840
framework some people just used to

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,630
develop or it and target the specific

00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,220
platform but actually since it's an open

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,430
to heaven child the goal of it is to

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,110
have a neat desktop environment with

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,960
since this is not the explicit role of

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,729
acoustical said which provides music

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,340
project which the wider main libraries

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,069
and a couple of useful application and

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,640
the local tools that asked if the be

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,890
supplied by other lines since peaking

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,690
out applications from different project

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,459
is always amazing confusing for users

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,470
because I never know what to get things

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,790
project started to have a and give a

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,380
consistent viral and I don't know if we

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,420
are the oldest of the bed phone is

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,019
farther than us I just know that that

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:45,250
one is called like them self is happy to

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:47,769
see anything yes officially it's not not

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,769
then if you're active but they didn't

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:55,239
really something for two years ago so

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,260
essentially can express the most active

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,430
class that gives you our workspace I

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,829
things are missing you'll have a window

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,720
managers and tools amazing but it should

00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:12,160
have usable environment what's in God

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,209
the project originally started as a

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,890
talking

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,019
repository so gradually John has a

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,709
mentor which is currently then you step

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,469
on Tinian and project leader he has idea

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,900
we will look for opens kept code and

00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,489
bought it to nurse them theoretically

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,010
should I play compile you know it's not

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,959
that waiver what we discovered is that

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,569
open source working around then it was

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,400
not one ounce or there is normal source

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:47,280
of many of the three of his depredations

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,799
which is sad some source code is lining

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,099
on but the authors are not willing to

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,129
give it away so we we know a couple of

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,469
occupation which we do want in which you

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:02,909
don't get because they also say all the

00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:05,040
code is messy and one for the easy no

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,650
way we have it many times just give

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,840
advice but we clean it up away and

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,109
finally so this blood it is a bit of a

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,340
dead end so if something comes up we

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:19,109
will do it but quickly it has been a

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,470
group of course deputations we will have

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:27,389
910 monitor it is that cpu monitor has

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:30,180
imported it's maintained and so now we

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,070
have the macintosh cocotte so they can

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,070
the applications kind of from that side

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,180
sometimes they are abandoned project

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,340
format like not maintain any more than

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,460
desmond rescue them for them so this is

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,639
other point yet rated by other project

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,080
sometimes then people start a project

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,780
called a bit and then it will remain

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,710
there this is typical of open-source we

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,970
had many are possible sometimes these

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:03,280
applications are time or we give you

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,639
depend of them and

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,250
you don't have a place to download them

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,950
nobody even catches them for for example

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,810
to the API changes we have no step so

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,270
essentially it's a bit form which is a

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,540
very it's a pity so we kind of handle

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,639
them here and we have a couple of them

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,960
and we we at least maintain a functional

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,570
and improving can I think important for

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,510
the end user experience at one place can

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,000
ignore them and there are applications

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,740
especially evident so angry right on

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,860
your application for your opportunity by

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,110
myself have not started any extra

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,020
product everything which I am to hide

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:50,590
put it in gap so what's been outside for

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:52,990
is not arisen within their application

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,910
latina this very long everything which

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,150
is needed the goal is not to make

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,640
something which has a lot of kids where

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,380
we depend on so you essentially need to

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,320
install the word project which is a bit

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,330
what they'd find us where we try to be

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,130
more like wait this is maybe not so

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,380
exciting with it has so many extra

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,440
features but there is a no-slip accolade

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,350
has enough future API features that you

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:25,280
can write with application if we need a

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:27,470
library we put in theaters key people

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,670
gregory johnson cementum if we mentioned

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,520
because they abandoned the project

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,130
didn't so it's an organism is in the

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,440
stage including countries their

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:41,570
dependents and human being disappointed

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:46,220
but then it's me into the mobile app and

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:49,850
the poor leader and I was most of the

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,220
new applications Greg is Morgan 14 and I

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,889
audition application which is like this

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,400
coochie and the database in battery

00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,890
monitor another tools when I Adam fedora

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,470
which is a former NASA project leader

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,570
and a defect for gamma is a white person

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,180
but he actually maintains the truth

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,650
languages are very nice and

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:15,200
beautification other people some are

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:18,740
past commuters which is a pivotal

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,960
nothing somehow not very active they can

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,600
report I'm accrediting as a vehicle six

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,120
month and of course all the original

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:31,660
others which I don't mention the levels

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:36,580
of anomalies will agree that oppositely

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,410
importantly left on the present occasion

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:44,270
the penological it's an image viewer

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:46,520
tool using spy by it's me so it just

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,310
opening if an open image they have a

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,640
list of images you can clip see in a

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,560
single window so if you have a list of

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,050
images like night of the window

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,790
or you can make push three it's

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,180
currently as far as not the morning

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:08,220
application in new step which languages

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:13,080
it works both on the mac and inclusive

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:16,260
because the main goal we define what one

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,330
year goal is to try to put every

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,580
application important map and reduce

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,210
them the demonstration for the

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,120
controller if it's positive make sense

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,040
it's not a process system dependent

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,750
application we will do that and this one

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:40,830
walks into the cruise control box and

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:45,720
water can even today we should have a

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:50,550
screecher here but since we can see some

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,020
of the notification I doctor it was our

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,380
address for people for example one

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,920
University for skating gold it should be

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:03,000
a library tools nothing special

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:06,180
and there's a ftp application the

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,870
interface is effective stand up it's a

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,779
to playing long time and more horsemen

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,760
it tries to implement the complete ftp

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,760
specification which is highly found in

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,570
modern p times it has all active passive

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:26,910
any four modes if you ever need them

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:28,980
they do work in this patient of you has

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,050
been quoted bottlenecking push enter

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,339
windows at one point that i wrote award

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,800
for socket code so that it can work with

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,519
windows socket because the values

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,070
playing Eunice resident was testament

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,760
walking hardly on windows even if it

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,339
sure there it didn't work away now it

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,740
works in exon if they expand this

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,980
application i fly out of the Mack only

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,850
looks unix hilarious and win the major

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:02,100
presentation of the power for it may not

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,470
be perfect about this it's a useful tool

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:09,440
and I could I think that only maintain a

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:13,610
deputation there were other well then

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,650
I usually I use daily so forward using

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,650
worked it has in her some shortcomings

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,140
this is a very nice occasion we are

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,290
playing with that for work of the units

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,600
before the beginning exam it's a better

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,100
graphics application and you can tell

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,510
you the original offer which isn't it

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,020
was a solid well politic with the

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,920
alternative of the World War space

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:48,440
system preferences other till atleast

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,650
engines a diversification like eight

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,910
years ago I think it's from to thousands

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:59,450
it was 40 it was written when you sleep

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,700
was limited it was very own stuff

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,610
specifically postal code and

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,820
notification just remain data for eight

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,370
years and nobody ever played okay it

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,100
wasn't even a dysfunctional with the

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,950
updated unhappy and completely

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,050
disinfected code so it has a Cohen

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:22,790
classically it clean out and extended

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,030
all the comments were written using the

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:29,890
a path so it can also walk hopeful

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:32,780
because forward and displayed for severe

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:37,010
this is a portable cord the performance

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,690
is good night defendant music several

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,270
bruises minutes per example can tell

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,070
circles because wasn't there it was a

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,850
little boy died so i did not get

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,550
expected i made war well control the

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,220
game a box for what was

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,750
to make a box mod enough leeway in

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,339
interest or the editors you can say the

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,750
form of this compact with the one format

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:04,330
didn't depend on think there are many

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,620
types around of course you can print

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,149
it's a document or an application I

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,420
think it's a nice application with a

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:14,089
business potential it still need some

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,550
work it's not obvious I now they don't

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:23,959
have made yeah that'll ease of the new

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:28,810
version this inner space this isn't

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:31,970
vegas has no droid this is big space

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,149
implementation so essentially you have a

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,769
screensaver running on your desktop

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:45,649
maybe it's a very used under this nice

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:49,640
it was a GP open stratification use them

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,769
you can animate pet dogs and the modules

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,260
are comfortable there is no mention for

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:58,730
the ipad Rogers not all are included

00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,399
because not every module has adapted

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,000
license because people drop them in open

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,420
source without giving a normal suicide

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,310
so we're hanging through the here

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,760
and this one column and we might even

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,850
create a new project probably and to

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:22,339
pick them out well with them somewhere

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:28,610
else of course when your picture plane

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:31,540
is a dance teacher it's gotta be too

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,800
painful the ultimate goal is to make

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,380
digital picture thing so it's a string

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,290
make uses an old laptop meta meta nice

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,750
one month put it there and if you look

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,699
very nice on on their website their

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,730
pictures of it after you walking this

00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:52,730
acne screenshot and she did some nice

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,180
blending code is either channel it can

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,570
display additional information our time

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:04,750
in shooting the children whether it's a

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,750
first in a program and appended to use

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:15,800
this is a Hydra later it uses of course

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,050
advanced polish notation because it is

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,279
what i use which potentially those like

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,690
a superior and i waited one and we're

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:30,140
slowly knocking a real scientific

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:34,100
calculator it's not being listened to

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:38,120
this name but you could look for it it's

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,730
all languages my LPN pipe or something

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,449
it's a same thought I can't change a

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:48,940
license for bsd to GPA for somebody ask

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:48,940
them I think it was that he has

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:59,920
I like there's no religion it there's a

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,600
couple of short for me it's not in my as

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,850
much as the man version by the new mr.

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,760
bash but it's a little early minor fit

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:12,730
for this is saying this one all the

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,530
countries walk there's only one thing

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,080
there's fighting about everyone asleep

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,670
if there is a mathematician we can have

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,670
a discussion about it in clemente

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:33,440
exponential thank you for non integer

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:39,170
numbers but everything it's just a

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:44,440
personal but this is mainly the

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:46,760
mountains classification lately unfolded

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,880
point because it has a report is still

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,630
underneath why because it's changing it

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,270
so rather as we discussed for years we

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,810
like to have a native canoes the

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:04,430
thousand environment for two reasons

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:08,300
first because risk and into that segment

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:13,640
because it acts as a test bed for under

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:16,870
the underlying HTML plane one which can

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:21,170
use of course outside a browser

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:25,750
everywhere when one is clay hyperbole in

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:30,230
this case we use simple logic which is

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,970
complete the implementation fewer than

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:39,939
PC of the web ppi so it's a complete

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:42,399
schedule I just across an injury

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:44,399
the major goal but it has many

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:49,269
advantages of the equipment is cleaner

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:52,629
it's not objects does glass toy cannon

00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:54,879
and is easy to identify them up which

00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:57,159
means provides on embedded devices or

00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:02,649
different platforms so we can support a

00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:07,750
much wider audience including that's

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:10,689
more so it's nice simply it's working

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:15,579
comfortable on the match we can build

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:18,879
the browser again the single weapon from

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:22,329
coco all in where people said so this

00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:25,000
heads across the backing and we can

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,949
inspect much better pages the interface

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,039
is extremely simple currently in

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:34,179
Tennessee Robotnik history but it s

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:37,600
bookmarks and it can read and I Safari

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:42,039
Pokemon from for Marquis list dis

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:47,100
convenient as you can it's a straight

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:50,710
shot from UNICEF age each other already

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,300
reasonably watching and I thought

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:57,220
further comprise

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:59,950
it's coming up the speaker was about

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:06,670
directly then they to present a simple

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:10,600
web key then we have terminal terminal

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:12,910
originates on backbone so he really made

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,880
use of the ovens was concept we can take

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,620
others GPA code including project

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,570
because essentially that one wasn't

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,540
maintaining and currently they did not

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,150
accept some texas it was not a portable

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,780
and so at the end of the pudding I asked

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:32,560
author many times and it was just not

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:35,380
progressing as rich so it may compile

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,200
the latest from stem to ovation which

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:42,910
was a major shift in a vice we are the I

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,310
personality cult to make it compile it a

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,960
platform a project the immolation is

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,150
made of the Linux kernel relational so

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,460
what I noise machines it better be

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,710
because it's extremely comfortable for

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,920
us but reduce cords which one of the

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,200
Wranglers and milks and I wanted

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,570
facebook for this course is what I was

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,360
anymore I know if you have a user which

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:12,200
is useful as if there's been no request

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:16,370
the multi-window temi expanded 10x its

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,940
usability for everyone others framework

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:24,130
which is sadly to say arrested project

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,130
because that was brilliant but i think

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:32,600
it's an implementation of the elders

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:36,220
plano forever so if you are writing the

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,500
same essentially and it has a front end

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,080
so that the menu is a supporter others

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,000
book but it provides the other services

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,520
for other applications and human uses so

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,270
there is one major Asian religions they

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,710
know and this is a most important reason

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:59,600
why they need to be kept up to date

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:02,210
because other alignment I think it's

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,309
very convenient especially devices you

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,309
want to have your very

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:16,059
it's more intimately for that does but

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,549
we monitor time on it or the more test

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:19,990
is as multiplication I'm going to check

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:23,710
in with you can just take the homepage

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:27,850
badly mendota uses your STI display your

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,710
battery status and some information time

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,840
monitor lizards if you money for demo

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,000
desk is important to our desktop so

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,919
infinity connect through windows FML

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:46,539
services what's convenient online it's

00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:48,460
in special flex issued the support this

00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:53,049
is was an application or derivative of

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,390
cocoa so it I think so severe alone so

00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,860
sport but the product told me got a hot

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:02,169
dog and display we bought him we're able

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,870
to contact him and we have the opposite

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:09,090
permission to put him in a project yeah

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:13,000
it's fine it's a quantity like scratchy

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,610
limitation no one takes it was a special

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,350
kind of scratching written provoking

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:22,380
step at the time was a major also

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,820
noticed import they have the same

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:29,370
concept

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:35,019
that's it there is an innovative way I

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:37,830
scratches yeah the finger is not that

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:42,519
clear it's different from Excel because

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:45,220
you can like data set here columns and

00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,309
each roll is abusive data set and then

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:53,740
you can drive and Claire different views

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:55,779
of the same data so it exhale eventually

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,450
pocket up with a pivot table but this

00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:02,620
one is actually want to be and the phone

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:07,750
and owners are not living inside cell

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:10,090
but their global for the scratch because

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,129
so when you drag around and change the

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,529
view essentially you have a queue and

00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:16,720
you are slicing it is a simple way of

00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:19,779
looking at the deputy can i call it the

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,679
hypercube in waiting the mature yes

00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:27,009
essentials are hyper fuel and the

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,690
foreigners need to walk in all the face

00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:34,389
of the cube this is where you include in

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:36,639
their study place because if the

00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:38,799
application is in reasonable walking on

00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:42,220
the map and probably they also left it

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,409
like a better stage so what but what we

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,509
need to do is clean up the system call

00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:49,480
for price but they are time in more than

00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:53,039
a identify the difference

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:57,340
between Coco in kino step and either

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,950
walk around in the PlayStation college

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,610
said doesn't come cuddles in the cocoa

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,130
or improvements desolated father home

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,310
features

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,610
we have a pen good job it on application

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,590
suddenly at work in which was six month

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,490
ago I don't think about because not in

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:22,710
the wig was hanging up we are using

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:24,390
complete New Nordic so we did not rely

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,960
the interface we did not change the code

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:32,190
so we just under nine file and something

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,440
that's very few so it's we had get their

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,390
presentation about portability and this

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,700
is a good example how you handle in the

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:43,290
Rabbinical based eventually may have to

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,570
do it to me some aspects and some kind

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,500
humans but the general important works

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:52,740
quite well the college savings we made

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,560
portable because Mac for gammas are wet

00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,570
sloppy accident project it wasn't the

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,880
magnets Prime the nexus one architecture

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:03,720
now ok this too because it has incurred

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,830
at the time ago test of this thing so

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,650
the car is absolutely reliant on

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,690
specific weary the API works the

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,160
processor works the operating system

00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,160
works so

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,500
it needs to be popular because currently

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:28,400
for example for seasonally on Intel

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:30,050
little spy on other platforms and at the

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,270
end everything is done we make parodies

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,920
anything and when they complete the

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,770
mission features for their missing

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,740
features and extended vacations I think

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,750
this is a major application which is

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,820
interesting because it is currently no

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,120
other they are probably no other open

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:51,800
source I can fix it so somebody threaten

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,170
this kind of magic model another product

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,240
product is being is that it's called a

00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:00,530
simple what we also saw this budget is

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,920
for way gradually is to is out hope

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:07,750
report we took the last version of B

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:11,600
which runs on ten point for men and for

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,970
the call you put it in here and this

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,130
goes in the further down the road

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,160
because it doesn't even have made fun we

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:24,980
use their people each with two to build

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:28,190
fix cold so it's pretty much the extreme

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,710
way I don't apply it completely oh yes

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,590
it has an if nests in the court pointed

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:38,289
some of them can you remove

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:42,010
and it was a recent ex she really wanted

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:45,940
a lot of what minor and major acoustic

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:51,100
to be hard work and it's almost usable

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:54,850
now so it's very nice there are still

00:25:51,100 --> 00:26:00,669
some bugs it's prevented from their

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:05,289
usage save problems with look at the

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:09,970
bundles in the images and text but it

00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:11,830
will be worked out and this 27 if you

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:17,649
don't want to use text editor on equity

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:20,169
very simple sketch artist the term by X

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:25,059
likelihood the main getting terrible

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:29,039
from and what their separators make no

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,039
sense in yes but it was

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,930
the good thing is we have the same

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,030
application on the map and one new step

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,250
which is the call of diversification

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:47,370
project be able to provide this it's

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,820
much easier to exchange data you may

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:55,200
never make left up and move the

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:57,780
workstation on the other way around we

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,480
have a couple of games which are written

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,820
by a gifted with an ax and maintain them

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,510
and then you stay tuned in those days

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:12,900
you can just play with the extinct

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:16,740
hopefully but the future of the most of

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,600
an application project we have a other

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,230
couple of vacation want to implement

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,540
we're actually have written 20 but not

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,190
my page because we should go through the

00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,750
last project we have that ecstasy that

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:33,240
we have in this butcher consuming on

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:35,900
American good at listening to do and

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,160
also because this application are not so

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,010
blocking but would be a nice to have a

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,960
login which would be one way to

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,960
recommend it with it company

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,850
maybe unix / see they said would happen

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,309
for me and we are thinking about innings

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:59,139
partner for the end user so if you don't

00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:02,019
want to use your distribution packages

00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:04,559
which is one way to do it we want to

00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,299
have an installer it just tastes like

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,470
the FN one but a bit more advanced

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:15,100
because it should give a few hundred

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:17,320
liquid architectures the best thing we

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,559
have our apparatus to have a single

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,730
tower which contains for example so that

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:28,409
is linux bsd powerpc health and then

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,409
they stole evidence for the point one

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:36,059
dependence is lacking in time is calling

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:42,730
out line ever doesn't have that we

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:46,750
should order some people say it's enough

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:50,049
useful because maybe you want to have an

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:54,309
interaction with the distributions

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:56,590
father it depends either use TP that one

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:59,740
in the building scholar or if you have a

00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,779
clean environment radically you can just

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,950
if you just introduced that you just

00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:07,740
click user install even so the system

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:12,120
ha just one man I think it depends on

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,610
the user user constitutive normally

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,889
environment maybe you put you or what

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:20,210
independent a mixed environment or just

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:22,440
like if the user decides to use them

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:26,039
environment isn't packaging too and then

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,110
you should provide our programs for

00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,510
those packages tools that and somebody

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,750
who wants to use a cute acoustic

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:35,580
environment can then use install it's

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,919
undergone are too polite I just father

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,130
distributions of that 17 kind of

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,970
environment then there's another tour

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,620
which is a necklace config that there

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,279
would be to have a tour to do I

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:52,919
challenge and the best bargains just a

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:57,510
convenience other application of the

00:29:52,919 --> 00:30:01,950
same time flow in the air like system

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:03,570
administration tools here so not not not

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,700
portable application at which are

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:10,200
convenient to a bunch of two is to

00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:14,789
administer users at mr. your network

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,279
card so means you expect from an

00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:21,369
environment

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:25,229
whether it were under any code but

00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,229
sometimes it's handy to have our

00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:31,719
available for writing documentation so

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,700
something lightweight we made it

00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:36,190
something we like we're value like right

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,619
at the edge because my cup titles not

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,899
like not a complete CSS not a Dream

00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:43,029
Weaver replacement without any to avoid

00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:47,590
the landing makes you happy yes exactly

00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:50,229
was often the goal is to an HTML in

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:53,669
widespread use digital Apple today's do

00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:59,399
it so you have document documentation

00:30:53,669 --> 00:31:01,700
program head notes in HTML so voluminous

00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,679
he use

00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:07,580
and the very first and instant messaging

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:11,630
application some people diversity when i

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:15,460
whistle messenger yahoo icq and you

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,460
can't name and does so many photo voice

00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:21,100
even a glorification with that so the

00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,419
staff they work for a bit they become it

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,950
difficult independence and libraries it

00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:30,260
sideways and not contain any more so

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:34,460
there's a new one it's a moot alia and

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:37,070
with equipment has to offer more

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,950
efficient in the applications we have a

00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:43,460
defender of a stretch it but maybe not

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:47,480
enough right right now this week is of

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:49,399
course a big task we have an iPad

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,409
application for San we will never get

00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,769
them with great hero resistant to let

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:57,230
some people still believe about that but

00:31:53,769 --> 00:32:00,309
that's not going to happen so maybe

00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:03,860
that's not fashion but if you step

00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:06,350
that's more desktop for the entered but

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,929
might be a point or can because I think

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:12,529
some people expected I mean ke has been

00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:15,919
office you can only have known office

00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:18,350
because we have to marry or four days of

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,830
an office which is and into everything

00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:30,580
more so everybody is a is a dia bar and

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:30,580
we see if either the office coming years

00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,980
dictionary tool because that's the way

00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:38,690
to there was one on the openstep we

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,460
might think there is a open dictionary

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,100
format we were also thinking about

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,630
camping which integrates with Wikipedia

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,880
for example just anywhere you can highly

00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,700
delicate hands dash the duty the dubstep

00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:58,630
l'occasion thinking about the digital

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,630
Webster application yes the resistive

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,789
there is already a ditch a translation

00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:07,130
dictionary by robert burns so there is

00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:10,909
hoping around its own course nay

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:13,220
depressing neither an essential robotics

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:18,740
handed i mean if you have it moving into

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:24,620
look out of water that's it actually as

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:28,840
far as golf course or schedule had rise

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:33,559
of the list which is an imaging vacation

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,659
we can i can prevent that your presence

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,659
as you notice i have also a couple of

00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:41,590
saipan simple web which might be of more

00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:41,590
internet different

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:51,390
we ask some questions yes of course the

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:54,120
day how about and licenses the music

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:58,140
that you change one project license from

00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,990
is t2 i can do the reverse I'm the

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:04,230
original ultimately of course offered by

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:07,200
I that and is it okay to put and BSD

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:11,190
license protected the gap or so

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,600
ridiculous okay because semana just

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:19,380
requires an officer open source license

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:23,810
which PSP is but if we have the ability

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:27,540
to change license we cover GPM ng pinya

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,360
because that was decided by gregorian

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,250
essentially a little bit because it's

00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,679
nailin way and it's completely wasted no

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,200
step itself since we've already had

00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,260
licensed products in the past that it's

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,660
better to avoid in the beginning next

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,110
question what about clue mean that looks

00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:49,200
like it's abandoned nothing changed over

00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:51,270
a long time we're not doing more what's

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,300
not busy author or what what's the

00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:57,210
daughter is still alive he says he has

00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,100
patches if you report problems here to

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,220
added unit saying always make news that

00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:08,940
problem which is not always too so it's

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:11,250
a bit of again whose fault is it and I

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,710
don't like his attitude things yes it's

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:17,160
a brilliant ification I think it's one

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:20,100
of the most complete application to have

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,510
a new step I use vuze it every day for a

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,510
long time and there

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,760
we don't have nice two important gap the

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:33,540
way we don't have the resources to have

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,740
another big application so we have

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,799
gladly to rewrite the code if only the

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,200
one who is hard for Utley who could you

00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:46,380
salute me so on the magnum ipod uses

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,990
nips and dick gusta for this is bad for

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,059
your buoy with several applications to

00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,390
hemline is also completely hot body

00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:58,230
because I'm of a light that way and at

00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:00,180
the end tween one idea gradually of

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,630
particles in the government intelligence

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,420
would you strong for Tamila we already

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:11,010
have video to live either interface to

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,079
use for critical moment translate it

00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,940
because we are going to provide

00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,799
translations but something professional

00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,510
stations just was coy and with long

00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:24,450
quite easy just a violent at the bonfire

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,549
language bonded to do that with local

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,670
agitate you can do it it's a useless

00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:32,520
thing yeah yeah in the same ship we done

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,210
for new mail but the idea is if we do

00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,390
that and we sent through patches but

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:43,670
really he do with dispatches okay is

00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:48,210
that very responsive collective channel

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:52,170
he has ugly at them he had provide 90

00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,420
toppers on his website though yes

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,049
they're not taught updated but it's much

00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,859
better than the last release so it has

00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:04,329
features like red eyes

00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:07,130
I don't know what why did it happen

00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:10,430
maybe you should and poke them a little

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:12,739
bit we do that maybe I made my life to

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,829
over yes maybe if it's always the same

00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:17,329
cast important the work on unit is

00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:19,910
important because I know that it has a

00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,839
wider you say it sure I mean the guy was

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:27,049
contacted by a purple fish Ethel nail

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,989
and especially their mind they not hunt

00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:32,480
mine use the end I don't know if at the

00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:37,160
end in a peasant work that's piece about

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,999
the quality of my work ok he told

00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:47,859
members and insulation products offered

00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:50,329
by the Patent Act I want yeah do you yes

00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,119
we were playing modernizing in the face

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:56,630
of several applications like reading the

00:37:52,119 --> 00:38:00,470
true bars and stuff like that some only

00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,609
had two months I guess it depends on

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:05,150
application for some applications

00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:08,329
definitely i'm going to definitely

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,329
update that grandpa's interface which is

00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:13,579
updated and complete and i want personal

00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:15,589
materially is like at this there is no

00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:17,480
one and then i plan to change things

00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:21,829
specters and update it to sort of be

00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:27,410
more quiet little i'd use follow we're

00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:29,960
sliders hello digital summary and

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,989
remarks to your book marker written by

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,359
marcus wanna know this is more

00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:44,369
bookmarking replication which

00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:48,480
and what's the word in it english type

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:52,619
in gentlemen dr. Lightman Matt Elliott

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,890
which measures your bookmarks and can

00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,440
bolton bookmarks from from revisiting

00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,999
the applications of central Bookman that

00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,150
her place to manage all your bookmarks

00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:05,249
and she parted it to close the box but

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,160
then you ended up there is a useful

00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:11,039
crystal because the other deaths would

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,779
know twisted application who bobbles

00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:18,450
were sent them than two hours maybe you

00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:20,579
should talk man we can i he's not a

00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,759
hothead for them we were serious is a

00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:27,150
really small guy we can be hope we can

00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:30,210
talk to him because i added as there is

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,380
no experimenters support for services if

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,420
you don't let you know there are

00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,910
services and on the mac you can already

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,980
use Vespucci as they open your hair into

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:43,289
so it should be easily integrated and i

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,980
try to hack this one who's that and it

00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:48,480
works wherever you are in mini you can

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,970
double-click only 20 but you can select

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,089
it and say we've always go increase your

00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,339
bookmark application maybe you you could

00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:58,170
have good use of it I don't know what

00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,210
they put in Jeter great for example with

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,119
Safari I don't know how he does it but

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,660
we can talk them in a religion is

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:11,430
competent with the Safari one the same

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:14,430
cell is that given to because there's a

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,350
much time for it whatever we could ask

00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:20,360
included what's on the knife end

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:23,090
one of the QR the disintegration so the

00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,820
more we create that remotely a user

00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,190
experiencing so if you look also an

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:32,960
other project firmly mix it like and

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:37,280
slava dark and collective cyber cyber

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:42,590
legacy of GPT education I don't think I

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:46,910
show you it later I remember yellow

00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:49,160
rubber duck I can I remember cyberdog as

00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:53,770
an open door when we knock out a tuk-tuk

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,180
it's like a good my b & A panel back on

00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,050
the only activity application i know was

00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:02,660
rifle which was interesting buttons

00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:05,840
sometimes is walking by design and it

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,960
implemented only passive ftp so i added

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,350
up my mind do you know colloquy we don't

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,960
know hugs and how its let me know i

00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:19,900
don't i know now this but i never used

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:25,100
it back it's a publication with i

00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,720
think that it Wi-Fi is life in da use it

00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,580
has support for that special protocol

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,620
date I guys useless slick Qualcomm and

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,300
it's anacoco application it could be

00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,750
really could be coordinated would be

00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,750
ported

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:46,840
and then the Home Office guys are

00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:50,120
planning to use cocoa for the neck part

00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,360
actually another has been talks about

00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,360
that

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,720
presentation on the simple web people

00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,840
watching

00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:25,309
I said the goal is to provide a weapon

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:39,990
it's about any spider few step so it's

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:44,190
not much a project is under the main

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:47,160
author is Nicola Shanna managers founder

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:57,210
is Europe but the dishes computers his

00:42:47,160 --> 00:43:01,170
main roles and haggadah hand-fed rises I

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:04,109
had his application he's import of this

00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,809
debits computers in walk in the open

00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:10,220
more for dolls and orders his mouth is

00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:13,650
small and nifty who's so he needed act

00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:16,230
is more of an empty he is a founder the

00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:22,050
main programmer from done for the boat

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:26,579
neck and his me and the tester I'm the

00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:29,069
guy who insisted that he put his called

00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,079
open source and new step and I'm on

00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:34,200
teleport to make the main files and

00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,900
things are using this at the end I

00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:41,309
also test hardwood I also mentioned

00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,670
pettyfer which is acclaimed women here

00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:47,180
he did not write a single and holding

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,680
simple a bit but he has been very kind

00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:53,970
fixing bikes and completing GUI

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:58,349
solidworks and because the working

00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:01,829
engine is really kicking out maximo you

00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:04,049
can one step further users exactly

00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:07,890
unexpected the google thing inside that

00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:11,069
XL to display the webpage so it's a it's

00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:13,380
interesting approach it works you can

00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:15,299
walk or for Savannah box what could it

00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,520
could it be feature complete the end can

00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:22,290
display tables and stuff like that turn

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:26,250
it on it yes you can it's not tables is

00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:28,230
the most colleague good thing but it's

00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:32,040
I've worked in your messing point five

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:34,799
make my path as a table which can be

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,099
embedded in text through so it says it

00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:40,109
can be done it's just a matter of funny

00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:44,609
okay so the audience can use the reserve

00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:47,099
is no not yet ok so what for the main

00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:49,710
features will be our web comfortable top

00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:52,200
in the placement so the API is exactly

00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,660
the same in fact the most businesses

00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,109
 on the mac can be combined better

00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:00,329
with the coco WebKit for simpler kids

00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:03,960
just by linking different target we're

00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:06,270
on the same issue 1 it's all the same

00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,430
binary for the Civil is not how April

00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,430
manages frameworks but it's not

00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:17,920
spawn points we are cross-platform

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,319
really toss platform since most of this

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,020
platform and before this entirely based

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:30,119
on four core memories we've offered mr.

00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:32,470
it works in football so the auto

00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:36,039
continue is check the same code and

00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:38,020
cobol use that and my step so we see the

00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:41,970
different is what is my stead myself is

00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:46,180
like for a smaller housing it's an

00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:50,260
agnostic environment optimized for very

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:55,040
small devices toys for context time

00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:56,930
devices the mother isn't here too

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,590
we have tested on many architectural

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:05,990
center music works we have two different

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:10,550
Solarius bsd previously obviously linux

00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:12,740
linux para pc some platforms were not so

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:16,670
easy for example we know that spark has

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,970
issues with new structures another

00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:24,970
healthy as we want and nothing where he

00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:28,340
thought well before they don't need and

00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:30,550
pure DTG of it i will say loud again

00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:35,900
it's no objective c plus bastard

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:38,750
whatever made an Armenian it combines

00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,630
from DC c295 other words where this

00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,850
place as expendable and having support

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:47,270
for order compilers very convenient for

00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:50,510
danger pictures so on linux we have

00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,760
always for one or two whatever on other

00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,380
platforms it's already the way or

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,520
they're back so it's convenient to

00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:01,370
support in Milan in fact real and third

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:05,060
we are from the very very few browsers

00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:10,540
and navigon in good health and what I've

00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:13,880
always do what we want romantic auto and

00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:17,450
that's going to mention so that is 2.5

00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,430
us back is put your hands open this this

00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:23,750
pan where they're very people houses we

00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:25,460
are this footprint is more so the answer

00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,290
final is between one and three megabytes

00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,230
depends on the processor architecture of

00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:33,530
course it is the fifth with their sights

00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:36,620
goes down other so this is probably the

00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:39,340
heritage from being a and better to

00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,340
think only

00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,800
possible uses browsers clearly both on

00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:49,820
workstation at hand is so gorgeous for

00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,470
example even in philosophy but it goes

00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,840
father since their white kid because

00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,820
I've seen a deliberately except so they

00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,660
can have held in documentation viewers

00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:02,420
which HTML and one of the cleansing

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:06,140
retentive new mate is to support the

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:13,100
during your team in lieu of HTML mail in

00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:15,640
main applications we have to add to the

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,590
week to look about it works correctly

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,290
the plane august seven see completely

00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:23,450
support at least are simply email

00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:26,960
management of the ending of sympathize

00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:29,840
and headers is an absolute with the

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,500
already a big improvement and another

00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,480
user is like kind of this is not

00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,690
implemented this or next month my to-do

00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:42,100
list you have no one wants it and nobody

00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:44,840
wants are recorded if it's in my step so

00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:47,359
most offensive performances mother of

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,900
lagging a bit differently compared my

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:54,440
HTML and i'm clear talk to me since we

00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,520
explain in asia good screen you can do

00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,270
that compassion and you can avail from

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,270
being in some mess

00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:05,220
but an institution meaning it's time

00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:11,140
essential is just like an item stables

00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:14,290
there's unboxing we do have potential

00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,970
for JavaScript support so our goals are

00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,400
probably much wider than for example

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:22,450
other and better things more dollars

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:26,560
like diddle so you should also talk to

00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:30,160
David cheese null is very advanced what

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:33,070
this comes to run time we can then

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,200
adjust and stuff like that and Eve them

00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:39,280
added several languages and scripting

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:43,360
stuff I movies do i do you talk to we

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,570
have a JavaScript interpreter so that

00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,910
one is present rates but we have this

00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,980
past it seem like much better than other

00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,730
simple browser but it gives up from

00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:56,620
zilla but little boxes of pages but we

00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,430
at least don't display anything because

00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:03,460
we passed portal page and another thing

00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:06,130
is CSS at least in that pilot also

00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:11,860
complete CSS code is very good but

00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:16,690
modern HTML and they called standard

00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:18,760
HTML attribute as CSS in line and so

00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:21,120
it's still HTML as far as features go to

00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,710
the don t you get is very similar but

00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,270
it's written differently right now it's

00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,910
just been wrong so other guys should not

00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:29,880
be too difficult and of course tons of

00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:33,099
plastic sister

00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:36,670
in the long-term road map so where would

00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:38,410
we want to go we've been answered by

00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,539
completely JavaScript support at least

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,579
as far as Eggman skip specification

00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:45,849
doors which doesn't mean you're any

00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:48,069
JavaScript page because there's so many

00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:51,119
recent ones around but at least you know

00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:56,349
you have some JavaScript you can use for

00:50:51,119 --> 00:51:00,700
example applications they have and most

00:50:56,349 --> 00:51:02,289
compatible pages gs-12 is a to-do list

00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:06,219
but that would be probably the most

00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:10,569
difficult high speed improvement thank

00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:13,749
you many there should be both

00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:16,839
optimization of the parser and in the

00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:21,789
way we display this because since we use

00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:23,890
a textview we need to be a bit smart in

00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:30,069
what we are doing otherwise respected

00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:32,289
place you know minna de is too much how

00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:34,809
do by fixing I can hide it on every page

00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:38,109
by fixing and the goal of the auto

00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:41,140
Nicholas is where SVG processing

00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:43,839
requests for android devices in a very

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:46,779
convenient I know that not many web

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,809
pages I could use it but it's a nice

00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:52,650
feature because its standard I mean we

00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:56,650
need to display graphics inside the page

00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:59,109
it should be stunned if not the way that

00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:01,359
it that was simple way to Cleveland if

00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:05,019
somebody else is instead interested in

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,579
Christ which was listed only the program

00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:08,999
you can ask me personally I go to the

00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:08,999
website

00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:17,410
other questions I think I made up a time

00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:17,410
millions of everybody I esque came late

00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:28,480
we can see some applications knife

00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:33,200
what's next on the agenda success and

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:40,940
Quentin in exchange for equal up because

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:42,560
I swore he did not show up yet if we did

00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:50,930
so not sure how we can find out what

00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:58,820
look at APIs which is a plumbing

00:52:50,930 --> 00:53:02,470
application very pain show vector

00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,470
drawing using nsp CFR

00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:12,530
these are squares but I think Donna's z5

00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:14,830
as of course for excitedly see a

00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,830
passport

00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:33,830
here using the African which just

00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,830
ultimate experience

00:53:52,970 --> 00:54:04,670
anyone was very smooth and zoom this

00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,670
should be our president and it works

00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:11,850
but it's a good spot involve an

00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,850
application

00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,330
okay if you have any adventurous we can

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,810
try the lattice pucci if we have network

00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,810
connection

00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,530
because we have a car jack village

00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:05,789
because of the nether patent in this

00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:09,509
place or different ones you and music

00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:11,819
later we can check out test eyes and see

00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:16,529
what you can also see the back of the

00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:18,739
truck coming to that okay you should

00:55:16,529 --> 00:55:18,739
have

00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:48,790
for example is it in title here not

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:53,250
currently for the court upon and we have

00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:56,579
support for quite completely not the

00:55:53,250 --> 00:56:00,010
specials charters like unix ligatures

00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:03,640
the translation for fight night as a

00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:05,619
school in the translation table is quite

00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,510
standard complete which was a lot of war

00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:10,540
but there are hundreds of symbols ugly

00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:13,329
called within the unicode and the

00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:17,859
display but we see for example at the

00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:24,579
least and I complete but it's coming

00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:27,700
analyzing this is intentional that we

00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:31,599
can say the book max because we don't

00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:36,900
have a title either these questions are

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:41,250
the ways we wait for pointing us yeah

00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,250
