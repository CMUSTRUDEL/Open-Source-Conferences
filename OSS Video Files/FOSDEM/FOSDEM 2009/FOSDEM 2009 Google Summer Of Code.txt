Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2009
Description: 
	Ever wondered what it takes to make a community of more than 180 F/LOSS projects and 5,000+ geeks create great software?

In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will explore the successes and setbacks of Google Summer of Code, the first global program designed to introduce University students to Free and Open Source software development practices and methodologies. Leslie will discuss the program's inception, history, and impact, and the evolving requirements for managing a large scale global community. She will share lessons learned during the past three years as the program's Community Manager, with an eye to providing audience members with strategies for organizing their own community participation initiative, and provide attendees with an update on Melange, the new work flow application designed to manage *Google Summer of Code* - or similar programs - and Google's first Open Source project developed in the open from the first commit.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
