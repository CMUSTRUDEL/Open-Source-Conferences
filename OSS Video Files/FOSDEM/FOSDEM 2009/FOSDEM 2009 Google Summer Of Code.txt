Title: FOSDEM 2009 Google Summer Of Code
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2009
Description: 
	Ever wondered what it takes to make a community of more than 180 F/LOSS projects and 5,000+ geeks create great software?

In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will explore the successes and setbacks of Google Summer of Code, the first global program designed to introduce University students to Free and Open Source software development practices and methodologies. Leslie will discuss the program's inception, history, and impact, and the evolving requirements for managing a large scale global community. She will share lessons learned during the past three years as the program's Community Manager, with an eye to providing audience members with strategies for organizing their own community participation initiative, and provide attendees with an update on Melange, the new work flow application designed to manage *Google Summer of Code* - or similar programs - and Google's first Open Source project developed in the open from the first commit.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

like one minute so if you could conclude

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,000
your fabulous conversing vanish it would

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,529
be awesome thank you I've already heard

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,529
the volume lowers the beautiful thing

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,690
okey-dokey let's get this party started

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,370
folks before I actually begin this

00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,690
closing keynote I would like us all to

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,490
give a round of applause to the

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,170
organizers and all the other volunteers

00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,170
who've a possum 2009 possible

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,910
and also a big round of applause

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,590
personally just because I'm asking

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,239
because Philip just had to go home sick

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,500
and is really unwell and was not here

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,949
for your applause to some extra applause

00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,949
for Philip

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,810
no see all right so to get started my

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,610
name is Leslie Hawthorne and I'm a

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,560
program manager for Google's open-source

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,050
team and I manage the google Summer of

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,090
Code program and today we're going to be

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,890
tongue keep taking a look at google

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,200
summer of code behind the scenes sort of

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,119
the internals of the program that all of

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,619
you folks don't necessarily get a chance

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,790
to know about as part of the outside

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:32,740
world here revealed at foz de 2009 a bit

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,930
about me to begin at the beginning I

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,899
come from the fair state of California

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,149
shown here in a small red square is in

00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:42,580
fact the San Francisco Bay Area where I

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:44,259
live I also grew up in the San Francisco

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,910
Bay Area which makes me something of an

00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,920
anomaly in Silicon Valley high-tech

00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,410
given that just about everybody there is

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,350
a transplant from somewhere else I also

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,390
attended school locally where at the

00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,130
University of California Berkeley where

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,229
I studied medieval English language and

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,490
literature so of course it makes perfect

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,590
sense that I'm here hanging out with a

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,550
bunch of free software geeks well

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,340
they're both about sort of an

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,560
apprenticeship model and feudalism right

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,700
it was funny you should laugh now thank

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,959
you all right so as I said today I'm

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,840
going to be talking a little bit about

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,340
the history of the program some of the

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,610
logistics aspects for running the

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,040
program as well as lessons learned over

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,440
time and specifically I'm going to take

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,209
you through my personal journey into the

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,760
world of free and open source software

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,200
and talk about my personal experiences

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,420
as a community manager for this group of

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,709
folks and hopefully this will be useful

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,120
to those of you who are thinking about

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,160
doing your own community outreach

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,410
initiatives to bring in new contributors

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,600
and we'll see how it goes there's going

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,060
to be some cute pictures of cats little

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,680
gossip should be lots of laughs and it's

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,870
not we can blame that guy right there in

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,579
the middle who said Leslie we want you

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,989
to come to pause them and give a talk

00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,489
about how you managed to respond to

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,870
every email you receive within two

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:02,410
minutes so let's begin at the beginning

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,109
a little bit of history years 2005 and

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,180
this dude Larry Page co-founder of

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,430
Google is thinking about solving a

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,230
problem and this time Larry's not

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,579
actually thinking about problems related

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,560
to internet search he's thinking about

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,230
an angel

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,510
problem which is that students go to

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,880
school they study very very hard

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,220
throughout the academic year and then

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,050
during the summer they take off they

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
drink beer they get jobs that have

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,470
nothing to do with computer science

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,180
computer engineering or technology and

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,060
they begin the academic year again

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,280
having lost Oh a quarter of what they

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,870
learned the year before and Larry felt

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,970
like this was a real problem even from

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,709
his own days at Stanford he felt like

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,360
students were backsliding because they

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,800
weren't getting employment related to

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,110
their discipline during the summer and

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,239
he felt like this was harming not only

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,709
their employment opportunities later on

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,380
which is computer science as a

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,299
discipline right so Larry thought okay

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,700
we should solve this problem how should

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,989
we solve this problem so you know Larry

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,150
being an American said I know let's

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,950
throw money at it we have cash so Larry

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,390
got together with my boss Chris DiBona

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,400
who is the head of open source at Google

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,500
and said all right we'd like to give you

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,510
funding for a program to help get

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,799
students working in computer science

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,680
over the summer what are your thoughts

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,700
and Chris and Larry a couple other folks

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,829
from a couple of their different teams

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,750
sat down and brainstormed and lo and

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,000
behold they came up with the idea for

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,419
google Summer of Code why not pay

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,370
students to work to improve free and

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,660
open source software projects they get

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,150
real-world software development

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,680
experience we compare them with a mentor

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,090
who can actually help them understand

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,910
how to contribute to their project most

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,520
effectively they actually get to work in

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,500
their field during the summer instead of

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,060
doing I don't know like the job that I

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,630
did during college I delivered pizzas

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,419
anybody how to do that it's not fun yeah

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,800
or one of our most successful google

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,250
Summer of Code students whose only

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,160
opportunity to work abroad during a

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,710
summer program was to wash dishes again

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,710
not fun not terribly related to computer

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,960
science so with the informal program

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,430
motto flip bits not burgers is kind of

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,950
their watchword um you know Chris went

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,560
forth and reached out to his social

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,990
network which for those of us who do not

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,610
speak web two point 0 means he talks to

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,260
his friends and said hey we've got this

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,289
idea we've got some funding we're

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,119
wondering would you

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,680
is like to work with some students and

00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,389
you know mentor them over the summer

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,029
will pay the students will give you a

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,099
donation for mentoring and you guys can

00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:39,490
find new contributors this way so about

00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:41,439
40 projects signed up and this was very

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,539
much an experiment right no one had ever

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,270
done anything like this before it was

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,149
open to students worldwide for the most

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,129
part it was you know not something that

00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:53,770
anyone had any idea how to actually make

00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,479
happen and there was no actual

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,869
infrastructure in place to support the

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,559
program at this point so every single

00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:04,259
thing was done by email from

00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:07,059
organizations applying to act as mentors

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,520
from students saying hey I want to

00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:13,330
participate i'd like to work with you so

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,279
again very manual process everything was

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,729
tracked on the world's largest

00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,949
spreadsheet i have seen this and

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,050
repeatedly need to open it and it takes

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,309
approximately two minutes and i wish

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,639
that none of you ever have to see

00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:29,919
anything like this as long as you live

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,779
so there were some lessons learned you

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,759
know mostly about international finance

00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:36,370
and taxes again something i hope none of

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,959
you ever have to deal with and yet

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,159
everyone agreed at the end of it there

00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,809
were some challenges there were some

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:43,059
problems but this was a game-changer

00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:45,339
right the open source projects that were

00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:47,349
participating really felt like they'd

00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,319
gained new contributors new ideas new

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,539
insights and they were really excited

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:57,309
they wanted to see it happen again

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:59,409
alright the year is 2006 and at the very

00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:01,930
end of March i joined the open source

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,519
team as a program coordinator to you

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,949
know make sure that people got you know

00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,019
their Chi shirt sent them and kind of

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,599
keep order on the mailing list and you

00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:12,369
know all that other good stuff so i sat

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,879
down my first day on the job and I said

00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:17,160
okay Chris this whole summer a code

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,009
thing

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,380
what do I do and the meeting one a

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,550
little bit something like this okay so

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,479
you got to go and talk to the lawyers

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,979
right because you know we don't actually

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,419
collect any contracts from the open

00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,009
source projects that we work with we do

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,840
all this stuff we just have like a basic

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,759
terms of service and that's all we do

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,050
and we don't like do any copyright

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,190
assignments or anything like that we

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,360
have to make sure that the legal teams

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,470
comfortable with that because they were

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
comfortable with it last year but we

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,690
don't know if they're so comfortable

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,880
with it so why don't you go and talk to

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,800
lawyers oh and by the way you need to go

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,300
and talk to the accountants because I

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
don't know it's something about taxes

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,620
like we can't withhold taxes or we want

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,449
to withhold taxes I don't know there's

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,650
something about taxes so you know make

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,050
sure you go and talk to the accounting

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,570
people and oh yeah we've got this shiny

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,550
new web application and it's going to

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,229
you know we're gonna take all

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,550
applications online nothing else is

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,680
gonna be done by email it's gonna be

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,759
great and when people submit evaluations

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,550
of their students they can do that

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,610
online too it's gonna be awesome except

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,190
it's not really built yet but don't

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,780
worry it will be and you know okay

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,180
alright so where can I learn more about

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,500
the web app do we have any documentation

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,320
now we don't really have any

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,150
documentation I mean we got the FAQ and

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,310
we've got the mailing list archives

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,930
you've looked at those right yeah I read

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,280
through that already okay yeah no we

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,200
don't have any documentation but you

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,080
know that's a good idea we should write

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,560
some documentation want to see that okay

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,450
you got it no problem oh and by the way

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,219
you know in six weeks we're going to

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,140
start taking applications from students

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,630
and in three weeks we're going to start

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,250
taking applications for mentors and I

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,410
don't know a couple of students from the

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,650
first year they don't have their tax

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,779
form or their t-shirt or their

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,360
certificate yeah a couple of students

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,010
and and you know we need to get all that

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,630
fixed before we launch summer of code

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:09,430
2006 to make sure you take care of that

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:13,029
too and okay go alright awesome I like a

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,470
challenge challenges are great so there

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,010
I was jumping into the deep end of the

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,450
pool all right I can take it now keep in

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,240
mind this number that you're looking at

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,250
right here it's the number of lines of

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,640
source code I dread proprietary or

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,170
otherwise when taking this job this was

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,230
the number of lines of source code

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,000
that I had written when taking this job

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,920
I now have about 800 lines of Python

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,300
under my belt I didn't enjoy it I am

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,430
forever grateful that you folks write

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,730
code so i don't have to i will always

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,529
talk to the lawyer so you don't have to

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,709
you know this is the number of mailing

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:51,100
lists external to my company that i had

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,389
been on when getting this job you want

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,959
to get right down to it this is the

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,000
number of times I'd used google groups

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,930
alright so you know here's a more clear

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,810
picture of the situation oh sorry so now

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:07,000
I wasn't totally and completely you know

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,260
unaware of what the whole free and open

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,540
source software world looked like I mean

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,220
ideas genome actually genome was my

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,079
first introduction of free software a

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,820
few years before joining the open-source

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,160
team a friend of mine was a systems

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,829
administrator for collabnet the company

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,300
that produces subversion and you know I

00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,160
was over in his health and I wanted to

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,899
play some mp3 so I poked his computer

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
and this weird little icon anything came

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,040
up and I'm like what is this lawn

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,779
sculpture thingy and he said no no it's

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,459
a free desktop operating system blah

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,480
blah blah blah blah I'm like okay so

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,589
what does this mean why does it matter

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,850
and he explained to me what free

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,140
software was and what open source

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,610
software was and that people were

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,279
willing to write code and contribute it

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,779
back to the community for free and I was

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,940
like well this is really cool I

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,970
appreciate that ethic that's really neat

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,920
but I'm not a programmer so it didn't

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,630
really matter to me right and yeah

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,019
hadn't really used it about three years

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,779
but you know hey i was browsing the web

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,000
using firefox so how much more could

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,690
there really be to it right can't be

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,079
that bad now so it was more like pool

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,140
deep end me out in the ocean about to be

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,569
smashed on the rocks but you know

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,040
clearly i didn't drown right here i am

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:23,350
and the program has been immensely

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,170
successful for those of you who

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,850
appreciate charts and bars and general

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,910
numerics here's a look at the program

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,040
over the last four years culminating in

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,430
2008 which was our biggest offering ever

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,470
we had nearly 1,200 students 175 open

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,209
source projects and eighty-three percent

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,450
of our student participants completed

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,520
their projects to the saddest

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,070
action of their mentors and mentoring

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,230
organizations so to give you another way

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,910
to look at this here's the lovely world

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,890
here are lines connecting all of our

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,670
students and mentors who participated in

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:04,460
google summer of code 2006 the same for

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,750
2007 for 2008 here are all the

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,790
connections that have been made

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,020
throughout the world and this is just

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,150
actually showing three years of the

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,280
program given that we had no shiny new

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:17,480
web application our data for 2005 is not

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,070
as beautifully visualized so what does

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,080
it take to make this happen what does it

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,510
take to bring together people in 98

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,910
countries across time zones language

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,110
barriers and help them to you know get

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,870
together and write great software well

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,460
it's not money money is not the only

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,410
answer it's really the shirt but what

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,030
gets that later so it's not shipping out

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,440
a whole bunch of books on software

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,820
engineering and software architecture

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,350
all over the world it's not getting

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,260
buried in an avalanche of t-shirts which

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,870
actually happens every year it's not

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,160
even fighting off killer robots while

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,420
you're attempting to just ship out

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,390
checks to people all over the world

00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:00,080
either no it actually takes particular

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,540
qualities and a particular set of skills

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,760
in a community manager to actually make

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,520
this happen so let's talk a little bit

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,120
about what some of those are first of

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,920
all empathy you need to be able to put

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,330
yourself in the shoes of someone who is

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,660
a brand new contributor who has

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,430
absolutely no experience and be able to

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,130
help them through that initial set of

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,350
hurdles as they're trepidatious a

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,260
nervous concerned kind of not really

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,840
sure where to turn and we hear from our

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,060
mentors in the program frequently that

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,980
the largest barrier to entry that their

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,470
students have is simply this nervousness

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,960
this fear they don't they're not used to

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,730
communicating in public they're not they

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,290
hesitate to send their patches or their

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,480
questions to a development mailing list

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,250
they don't want to talk in IRC they'd

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,750
rather just send private mail to their

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,570
mentor

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,340
and you know the general reason for that

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,710
is they feel intimidated right a lot of

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,020
these people are on mailing list with

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,430
God's of open source and who wants to

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,040
look like an idiot in front of your hero

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,770
right we're talking about people like

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,930
say these three gentlemen the gentleman

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,310
in the middle and recharge L who in

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,110
addition to being known for his work on

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,750
salmon our sink is actually the most

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,450
intelligent man in all of Australia no

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,400
pressure or help with the gentleman in

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,390
the black shirt sitting down Brian acre

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,850
the lead architect of MySQL again no

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,470
pressure you could be in a really

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,940
interesting situation where you could be

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,070
hanging out on a mailing list or in an

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,810
IRC channel with a gentleman like John

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,880
Mad Dog whole shown seated there playing

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,190
with his camera you know one of the

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,410
grave beers one of the people who's been

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,180
around in computing since the very very

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,680
beginning again no pressure and I could

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,840
certainly empathize with all of our

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,450
students who are concerned about this

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,640
process because I got to be on a mailing

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,930
list with all of them and embarrass

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,500
myself and embarrass myself I did

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:59,350
frequently actually now these of course

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,420
are just the folks who are community

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,940
members that I was working with during

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,350
summer of code 2006 let's talk about the

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,670
folks that I was working with it Google

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,440
my boss former / Todd editor you know

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,860
the dude who talks about linux on tech

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
TV he was sharing an office with the guy

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,050
who was the chairman of the apache

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,120
software foundation and you know the

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,320
couple of engineers on my team early on

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,770
they were some of the original

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,310
developers of subversion in fact at the

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,820
time I was sharing a cubicle with this

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:36,600
gentleman carl hubbell who in addition

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,120
for being known to his work on CBS is

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,110
quite literally the guy who wrote the

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,770
book on producing open source software

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,970
no pressure my friends there is one word

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,840
in the English language for this

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,970
situation

00:15:50,840 --> 00:16:04,470
it's intimidating actually there's three

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:05,640
words it's so again remember when you're

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,290
when you're dealing with brand new

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,550
contributors and you know certainly this

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,810
advice goes for those of you

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,180
participating in google summer of code

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,440
as mentors but just in general if you're

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,390
interested in bringing new people into

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,160
your project remember to be empathetic

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,410
remember that time that you didn't know

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,730
everything when this wasn't just you

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,050
know something that you didn't even have

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,210
to think about and remember what it

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,120
feels like to be in that situation and

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,710
think oh man anything I do is just going

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,110
to be a total screwup and I'm totally

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:34,620
going to embarrass myself again empathy

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,220
is key so what kept me going right in

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,900
the face of really skinny intimidating

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,920
that thing was curiosity and I think

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,260
that that's what you're going to find

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,870
actually is a great way for you to

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,560
separate out newbies you come to your

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:52,980
project successful potential successes

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,550
from a potential time sucks shall we say

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,200
right curious people come to your

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,390
project they have questions and everyone

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,400
starts awful questions right and maybe

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,800
they don't look at things quite the

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,209
right way but they want to know more and

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,650
knowing what's new contributors are

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,060
worth spending time on is the difference

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,770
between finding someone who's curious

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,230
and if you point them in the right

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,300
direction for example go look at this

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,709
part of the documentation check out the

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,449
comments in this part of the source code

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,030
and if they come back to you with useful

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:28,860
questions or suggestions or even a patch

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,710
probably good potential new contributor

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,890
if they come back to you saying yeah I

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:38,040
read it and I didn't get it and can you

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:43,260
just like tell me what it says probably

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,570
not so much a good use of time so my

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,030
curiosity was actually about these

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,220
people right I'm a people geek I love

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,690
knowing how people work I love knowing

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,030
what makes them tick why they get

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,260
excited about the things that they do

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,120
this picture is actually taking it one

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,250
of our annual mentor summits each year

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,510
we invite two mentors from each open

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,870
source project that participated in

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,250
summer

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,990
code to come and hang out with us and

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,450
talk about how to improve the program

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,500
and also how to improve open-source

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:13,110
overall and I really just wanted to know

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,260
who are these people why do they do what

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,330
they do what makes this academic guy

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,100
who's a professor at Portland State the

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,990
same thing as that guy who owns his own

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,210
proprietary software company but works

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,370
on open source and that dude who's a

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,910
game developer and that guy over there

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,590
who's like playing the oboe in one of

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,470
our conference rooms all day to like you

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,450
know get the vibe going on why are they

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,090
here what do they want what makes them

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:44,820
tick and how can we help them get more

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:46,620
cool stuff done so needless to say a

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,710
role like this requires people skills

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,940
and it's not just you know being able to

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,040
make people feel good when they're

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,570
feeling socially awkward because you

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,540
yourself have a tendency to be socially

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,980
awkward it's not just knowing that you

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,800
know your hacker friends like the

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,410
occasional free beer that's sort of the

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,330
obvious know what i mean by people

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,610
skills is the ability to talk to folks

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:12,150
from multiple different disciplines

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,660
profession walks of life and actually be

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,280
able to understand what they want so

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,770
here's an example this is my typical

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,140
everyday life i'm at my housewarming

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,510
party and my roommate who works on the

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,280
freebsd project proceeds to you know

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,020
bring in guests as they enter the front

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,260
door and then introduce them to each

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,490
other purely based on project

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,230
affiliation pc-bsd nap EST openbsd s

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,309
over there and like my my roommates the

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,630
google Summer of Code shakin like

00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,860
FreeBSD is in the corner over there and

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,940
I think there's one dude forma que te

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,170
and he's over there by that was it you

00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,830
know when I was weighing patiently I'm

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:53,400
like IRC handle anybody know these

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:57,179
things we call names no not happening

00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:01,260
and yet this didn't strike me as all

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,059
that odd wasn't that big of a deal now

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,650
my friends I don't think I need to tell

00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:08,010
you that this is not what most people

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,929
would call a normal conversation not

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:14,070
really no not so much they

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:15,600
these things we call names so you need

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,639
to be able to be the kind of person who

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,249
can walk out of that situation feeling

00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:21,960
completely nonplussed and feel equally

00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:25,200
comfortable walking into an office with

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,169
you know a team of lawyers and proposing

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,149
to them some crazy notion that you know

00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:32,100
you want to run this worldwide program

00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,690
for kids to write software and oh by the

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,279
way you know we aren't actually going to

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,259
probably use most of the software that

00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,460
we get written through this and we're

00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,440
going to pay them and we're not going to

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,330
expect anything back from it oh yeah and

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,490
we don't really want to get copyright

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,470
assignments or you know a bunch of

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,419
contractual stuff because then we'll

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,769
never actually be able to do this so can

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:55,529
you make this happen for me Kenny now

00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:59,639
fortunately our lawyers are paid to say

00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:01,259
yes but I can admit I can imagine not

00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:03,480
all of you will have that good fortune

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,249
so this is when your powers of

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,470
persuasion and your ability to meet

00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:09,210
someone where they're at and really

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,210
understand that safe lawyers are

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,529
typically paid to be risk-averse an

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,179
understanding that your way of helping

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,399
them understand how to help you get what

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,490
you want is to speak to that risk

00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:22,019
aversion and then you know you need to

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,909
go into the next room and talk to the

00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,919
accountant people who are really

00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:28,950
concerned about dollars and cents in the

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,440
bottom line and that who will still

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,179
never quite understand why you're going

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,889
to give away all this money to people

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,690
who are not actually doing anything for

00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:39,539
you can you explain that to me again

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,070
sure what does this open source thing

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,480
I'll explain it to again no problem and

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,999
finally they just look at you and go

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,279
okay well I still don't get it that's

00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:49,529
cool but you know we need to pay

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,119
students in a particular method because

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:53,309
you know well it used to be that we were

00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,409
using western union but we discovered

00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:56,820
that their fees were far too high so now

00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,519
we're going to pay people using stored

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,559
value cards and no we can't really give

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,879
you a report about all the payments we

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,379
made last year because the backend

00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,419
system to do that isn't where it needs

00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:10,619
to be so I hope he kept a spreadsheet of

00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:13,110
everybody who paid yes good um and you

00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,509
know by the way we were experimenting

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,159
with a new payment system and so we'd

00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:19,019
like your program to be the trial run

00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,410
for that because we figure Summer of

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,090
Code

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,230
looks most the most like paying

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,700
everybody in the whole world because

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,900
you've got like 90 countries right so

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,010
you want to help us experiment yeah

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:34,080
that'd be great let's do it all right

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,790
then you need to be able to do things

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,170
like worry about taking care of the

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,300
people that you care about meatspace

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,250
right this is a picture of the

00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,800
Googleplex we host developer conferences

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,240
there all the time and you need to be

00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,690
able to talk to folks like your security

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,400
guards who really are paid to say no who

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,180
are paid to wander around making sure

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,710
that everyone is not up to no good and

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,440
you know talk to them and say hey guys

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,120
so um you know I've got some people

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,680
coming in and they work for you know

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,300
free and open source software projects

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,640
and they really don't want to execute

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,400
the NDA so can we not make them sign the

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,660
NDA oh no everyone has signing under

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,860
here it's absolutely required everyone

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,040
signs India it's very important we sign

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,160
the NDA but they're not actually going

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:20,280
to be anywhere where they could see

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,390
trade secrets well that's very

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,980
interesting i don't know they really

00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,410
think they still use anything i'm not

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,150
sure about that but but i promise you

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,560
they won't actually go anywhere where

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,290
they're not supposed to go i know these

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,780
people i trust these people alright fine

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,190
they don't have to sign the NDA but no

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,940
problem don't worry about it's gonna be

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,890
all good and you know then there was the

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,290
the wonderful fabulous her love so um

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,390
hey Marty it's our director of security

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,100
again the guy who gets paid to be risk

00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:50,880
averse and say no just as much as

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,170
lawyers usually so you know we have all

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,790
these great developer conferences here

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,170
and it's really cool so we want

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,230
everybody to be able to videotape their

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,460
sessions oh no no nobody gets a video to

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,190
have anything around Google it's not ok

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,590
but Marty they're not talking about

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,490
anything related to Google are you sure

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,350
they're not talking about anything

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,360
related to goo I'm positive this isn't

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,660
even Google stuff well then why are they

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,660
here

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,019
because we love them and we have extra

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,779
food and bandwidth that we need to feed

00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,880
you are having her friends alright fine

00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,840
go ahead it's fun right just go ahead

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,809
and do it just make sure nothing bad

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,159
happens like yes score so if you're

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,360
gonna be a good community manager you

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,639
need to be the kind of person who can

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,029
talk to all of these people and get them

00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:34,500
all moving in the same direction and

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:37,529
folks I assure you this is not actually

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,710
easy but if you're good at it you make

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,320
it look easy and a lot of this is just

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,070
about being a good listener right

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
actually sitting down and taking the

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,090
time to communicate with people talk to

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,769
them about what their concerns are talk

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,750
to them about their constraints talk to

00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:53,399
them about what their needs are and not

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,220
only just listen but take the time to

00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:58,440
understand their motivations right why

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,120
is this dude worried about someone

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,799
videotaping a session well he's worried

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,679
that you know Google trade secrets are

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,370
going to leak out onto the interwebs

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,860
fortunately we don't have to worry about

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,299
that why are our lawyers worried about

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,010
copyright assignment well they're

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,809
worried that we might get sued but

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,760
that's not going to happen and if you

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,970
can actually make a plan that speaks to

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,769
everyone's motivations then you actually

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,100
achieve you know you get consensus you

00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,970
get success and life is good you'll find

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,679
that when you do this you're actually

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,779
becoming a connector what you're doing

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,179
is you're taking the opportunity to

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:32,340
understand members of your community be

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,139
that you know your legal team your

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,100
accountants or in your case other folks

00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,919
in your free open-source software

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,570
projects and you'll know you'll be able

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,309
to best assess the strengths and

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,380
weaknesses of all your participants and

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:46,289
you'll know whom to connect with whom if

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,360
you want to get things done in the case

00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,500
of bringing in new participants it may

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,960
be that you have somebody who's just

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,630
totally solid and brilliant technically

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,549
right and they don't necessarily have a

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,740
lot of patience say for newbie questions

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:02,549
this is not someone to pair with a new

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,419
key is not a good idea you on the other

00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:05,340
hand you might have someone who's

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,779
incredibly enthusiastic about you know

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,820
bringing in News contributor someone who

00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,309
really likes teaching someone who really

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,870
likes mentoring and yet they're not

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,159
necessarily the right person to pair up

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,269
with someone who's looking to enhance

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,399
their technical skill set in a

00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,450
particular area and that's when you make

00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,789
you know you go ahead and you make the

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,470
call who do I put who do I put together

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:27,090
to make good stuff happen

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,400
to get good stuff done all right another

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,870
thing that happens when you want to be a

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,000
good community manager and you actually

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,679
want to do you know outreach initiatives

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,320
within your group you have to be scrappy

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,030
and by scrappy I mean you need to be

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,309
resourceful you need to do more with

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,440
less you need to think about creative

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:47,220
ways to use extremely limited resources

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,650
to get stuff done one of my favorite

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,090
stories is we did a program for high

00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,409
school students to get them involved in

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,809
open sores we'll talk a little bit about

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:58,169
that later but we had no way to actually

00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:59,940
manage the program that we wanted to do

00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,520
so we just you know sort of used the

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,900
google code issue tracker because it was

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,789
there we could make notes in it you know

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,020
actually tracked everything you know

00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,860
almost killed a couple people but that's

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:13,380
all right so that being said you know I

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,760
tell people that you know at Google we

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,179
believe in doing more with less and

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,010
people look at me and go man you're a

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,240
big multinational corporation you got

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,490
lots and lots of money you don't have to

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,780
do more with less and I go oh no no

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:30,480
these this she is not true this is the

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,610
number of people on Google's open-source

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,710
team so this is the number of people at

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,530
Google 20,000 person company who are

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:43,440
responsible for all open source stuff

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:44,789
nine people of those 9th people 3 shown

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,820
here in front the awesome android statue

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:50,010
myself shown here actual size kat almond

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,650
shown their actual size and she's going

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,169
to stand up or I'm going to this will

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,559
the real cattleman please stand up thank

00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,559
you very much

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,140
and the lovely Miss lmco erased an

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,890
addition to our team we're responsible

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,170
for all of the people oriented stuff the

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:14,440
google does around open source software

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,750
so that's google summer of code that is

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,120
our high school program the google

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,760
highly open participation contest that

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,250
is all of the news about the events we

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,510
run the code rerelease and all the stuff

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,910
that we're doing in the wider world of

00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,650
open-source software on the Google

00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,780
open-source blog and we're also

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,370
responsible for hosting all of those

00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,950
wonderful events when people come to our

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:39,790
campus and hang out with us and hack and

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,730
get stuff done so like I said it's all

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,560
about doing more of a class now it

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,210
shouldn't surprise you that that's the

00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,550
case because really our team is focused

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,930
on getting code released right and

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,190
making sure that when we do big open

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,530
source projects like Android they're

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,530
done right and you know correctly in

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,140
terms of licensing right and what that

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,750
basically means is when we're taught oh

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,890
sorry we have have released 212 projects

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,080
thousands of lines of code it's very

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,930
exciting and basically what that means

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,170
is we get twenty five percent of an

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,280
engineer for this program on a good day

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,870
the system that we've been using is

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,930
infrastructure has built been built

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,670
almost entirely by interns it's not

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,220
maintained when the program is not in

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,290
session we get to experience the joys of

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,880
bit rot how many of you here have

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,880
experienced the joys of the current

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,110
google Summer of Code web application

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:36,970
how many years did it take off your life

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:38,680
235 yeah 10 there you go so needless to

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,390
say as we would not like to shorten the

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,520
lifespan of our friends we came up with

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,140
a great solution to this problem which

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,370
was also a great solution to another

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,290
problem which is folks would

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,970
consistently come to us and say we think

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,310
summer of code is great we want to run

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,540
our own grant program we'd really like

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,510
to take your code in your infrastructure

00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,320
and reuse it we had to say well it's

00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,240
entirely dependent on Google

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,370
infrastructure we can't help you and now

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,380
we have the lovely malone's project yes

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,300
it's named after the spice that extends

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,470
life and consciousness since we knew we

00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,780
were taking years off your life in the

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,180
first place that is a cool picture of

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,130
connect the dots Paula trees I like so

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,960
fortunately we are going to be talking a

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,120
bit more

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,380
Milosh and how you folks could use it as

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,240
well if you'd like this is the first

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,570
open source project that Google's done

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,590
in the open from commit one so if you're

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,820
interested in doing your own newbie

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,190
outreach program you can take that code

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,390
make use of it but for now I will beg

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,750
your patience patience another key

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,399
aspect of dealing with the newbie so and

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,130
I consistently get asked by folks like

00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,840
how do you manage to not like go nuts

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,690
with all of the stupid question emails

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,100
you get and it is hard you know cuz you

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,020
get asked the same question over and

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:51,419
over and over and over and sometimes it

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,450
looks a little different but it's

00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:57,419
basically the same question and it's in

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,190
the same thread and usually it's someone

00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,830
exploring some corner case that has

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,149
nothing to do with reality like well I'd

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,980
really like to do part of my project

00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:06,450
from Tajikistan and I'd like to do part

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,679
of my project from the Canary Islands

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,090
when I'd like to do part of my project

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,470
from New York and then after that I

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,659
thought I'd like you know I don't know

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,890
not submit my coat at the end can I

00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:20,120
still pass no really no nothing i'm not

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,289
gonna happen right so needless to say

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,270
situations like these are going to cause

00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,309
even the best of us a small amount of

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,340
frustration a little bit of

00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:32,070
consternation in fact it may even cause

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,510
you to think my god do i need to

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,289
schedule you for an appointment with a

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:40,200
clue bat but you know that that's when

00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:43,230
you take your moment to to relax to

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,580
repent reflect reboots to enhance your

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:50,130
patience you do not scream rtfm you may

00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,929
think it really loudly but you do not

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,500
actually say it and this is for a couple

00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:57,559
of reasons one believe it or not this

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,330
phrase is completely non helpful folks

00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,830
you know there were many occasions as I

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,350
started off on this wonderful journey

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,740
when perhaps there was no m for me to

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,630
read there were times when I would go

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,760
and ask Google before asking dumb

00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,740
questions and since I had absolutely no

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,909
idea where to start all the search

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,299
results that came back to me were

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:21,090
utterly useless another thing to realize

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,230
is this is a great answer to someone who

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,110
looks just like

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,760
who acts just like you if you're already

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,070
here if you're already involved in free

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,360
and open source software you are the

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,500
kind of person who's going to go and dig

00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,790
your hands in deep and you're going to

00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,960
figure it out no matter what you're

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,240
going to push on it you're going to bang

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,040
on it till you have an answer and if

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,630
we're trying to bring more people in if

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,690
we're trying to bring in new ideas and

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,570
fresh perspectives those people aren't

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,340
already here if they already were going

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,650
to just benefit from an answer like this

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,820
we would have already found them so this

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,679
doesn't actually help us bring new

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,140
people in and that is a bad and sad

00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,820
thing and the other reason why this is

00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,010
is not really such a good thing to say

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,470
is you have to figure you're not just

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,340
looking for the new inexperienced

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:07,620
contributor who is going to go Ivan

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,630
and run away screaming like a scared

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,070
bunny how about the experience

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,930
contributor someone who actually knows

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,820
how to program already someone who

00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,930
actually knows how your system works cuz

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,330
I've already checked out your source

00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,620
code and figured it all out what happens

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,880
when they come and try and engage with

00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,520
your community and they hang out in your

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,290
IRC channel and everyone's being kind of

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,090
catty to each other and you know sand

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,470
stuff like that what's going to happen

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,890
when they look through your list archive

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:35,250
and they're like whoa flames best

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,650
central this is not always a compelling

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,340
strategy to get someone to spend their

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:42,950
free time writing your free software so

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,710
therefore i recommend patients

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:49,500
gentleness and you know you will have to

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:51,390
repeat the same answer to the same dumb

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,810
question over and over and over again

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,850
and that is okay cast a wide net see

00:33:54,810 --> 00:34:01,320
what comes back the investment i assure

00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,490
you is worthwhile be available if you're

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,570
looking to bring new people into your

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,190
community you really need to be

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,960
available and what I mean by be

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,270
available is you need to be there to

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,930
answer questions and really motivate

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:16,140
things along I know when I've joined the

00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:17,880
open source programs office in 2006 I

00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,130
was highly available I would get about

00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,390
four hours of sleep a night I was

00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,970
literally responding to every email

00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:27,030
within two minutes of receiving it I was

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:28,470
in IRC constantly and you know it has

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,240
gotten a lot better since then and that

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,500
is a good and beautiful thing but the

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,180
point is I wanted to be there to

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
facilitate to make sure people have the

00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,480
information that they needed to be

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,010
successful and that's really what being

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,060
available is about and I don't know I

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,130
don't know too many people who when they

00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,010
send their hey i'm on vacation mail it

00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,500
goes to this number of people maybe some

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,420
of you in the audience this is the case

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,220
but what I'm trying to make is you can't

00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,930
scale infinitely but if you're really

00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,100
interested in being new bringing new

00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,770
people into your project you need to

00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,570
make yourself available and yes it's a

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,980
lot of work I assure you it's worthwhile

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:06,360
and if I did it so can you what you're

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,350
going to find when you're doing

00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,690
something that's incredibly successful

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,760
is you're going to end up in spy

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,140
people they're going to look at what

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,300
you're doing and they're going to want

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,210
to do something a lot like it just like

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,160
it I've personally talked to numerous

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,569
projects who have participated in summer

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,990
of code or just looked at the Summer of

00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:25,130
Code model and said oh my gosh we love

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,260
what you're doing how do we do something

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,720
just like it and it's anything from say

00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,910
the open medical record system project

00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,180
that first started participating in

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,250
summer 2007 they were making a database

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,869
for medical records and it was all to be

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,730
deployed within the developing world

00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,890
specifically focusing on patients who

00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,640
had AIDS and they came to me and they're

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:48,500
like we have no developers in Africa our

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,720
software is being deployed in Africa we

00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,940
think this is a bad thing what do we do

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,170
to solve this problem so you know i sat

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,630
down and hashed out with them a couple

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,640
of different ideas and in fact their

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,180
first externship program was immensely

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,310
successful or say talking to the olpc

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,990
folks about their summer of content

00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:14,060
project and home ah you know stop yeah

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:15,800
oh that's something sorry my bad anyway

00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,839
so talking to you all pc folks about

00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,119
their summer of content project and you

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,940
know they were trying to get content

00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,680
creator for the XO laptop and like you

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,150
know i don't know what was it in three

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,829
months we want to get like a thousand

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,000
different documents and at least 15

00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:30,560
different languages and how do we make

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,119
this happen and we want to use the

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,500
Summer of Code model and how do we

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,420
figure out how to pay people and and

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,970
that was a very long and interesting

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,849
meeting about workarounds for the

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:43,910
vagaries of International Finance let me

00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:45,470
tell you some luncheon that we're going

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,640
to talk about this before sometimes you

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,849
can even take a moment to inspire

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,290
yourself I've been working on summer of

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,640
code for two years when I was really

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,560
excited about it but I thought I want to

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,480
do something new I want to do something

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,880
that has a greater impact a larger

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,040
outreach and summer of code is awesome

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,810
because it gets college and university

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,240
students you know involved in this world

00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,089
but by the time you get to college isn't

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,230
it already a little too late I mean what

00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:10,369
if your college doesn't do anything

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,930
open-source you're gonna have you're

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:13,369
gonna spend a lot of time you know

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,990
fighting to actually be able to work on

00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:17,090
this stuff what if we get you get you

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,520
while you're even younger

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,990
why not so we came up with the idea for

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,360
the good of highly open participation

00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:27,750
contest so we went to 10 different open

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,010
source projects and we said hey do you

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,540
have a lot of stuff that you want to get

00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,750
done that no one ever gets to that's

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,920
kind of like bite-sized work and I said

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,950
yeah we have a ton of stuff like that

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,140
like okay great make me a task list make

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,540
me a to-do list your dream stuff that

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,370
you all want to get done and no one has

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,010
time to work on it you know don't make

00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,690
it too difficult right like yeah rewrite

00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:51,480
my entire file system no not so much

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,010
that and you know we'll go ahead and

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,680
we'll fund high school students

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,860
secondary schoolers to work on this and

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,840
in two months we had 350 kids 40

00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,690
countries a thousand of these little

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:07,380
bite-sized chunks of work done that was

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,970
amazing do we have any google highly

00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,180
open participation contest students here

00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,680
ah we have one mentor there I heard

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,640
there was a girl from Holland who is a

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,640
participant where is he pointing rock

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:30,750
real success shown actual size all right

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,250
I think probably one of the most

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,200
essential aspects of being a good

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,680
community manager and bringing in

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,779
newbies is humility and I don't just

00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,630
mean humility in the sense of not being

00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:45,250
overly convinced of your own self-worth

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:48,549
I also mean humility in a very different

00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:51,130
way and I will explain to you what I

00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:55,770
mean this is humility of knowing when

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:58,089
you know too much so this lovely poster

00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,730
resides in the window of a local

00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:03,309
restaurant that I frequent called El

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,170
Pollo Loco which for my friends who are

00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:07,480
not spanish-language enabled means the

00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,299
crazy chicken shockingly enough these

00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,329
guys serve chicken and I was walking up

00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:16,240
one night to get done and I went hey we

00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:19,119
cater this is good I like having friends

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,680
over we like chicken maybe I don't have

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,240
to cook that's not so bad I can make my

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:28,809
vegetarian friends some hummus for good

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,980
and then I went 18 atpl to go and I

00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:33,430
would really just stop with the middle

00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,079
the park you want what what EP a-- what

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:40,390
does the eclipse public license have to

00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:43,390
do with chicken what uh oh yeah El Pollo

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,220
Loco oh yeah got it okay and that was

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,349
when I knew I was never going to

00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,170
effectively be able to look at anything

00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,900
with the eyes of a newbie not when my

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,789
initial reaction to something that is

00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,589
clearly has nothing to do with

00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:59,890
technology was a technical response

00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:01,390
right and so sometimes if you're working

00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,039
with someone who has no experience and

00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,779
you're trying really hard to explain

00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,130
something to them and you know that

00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:07,869
they're just not getting it and you know

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,359
that they're enthusiastic and they are a

00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:11,950
good use of time sometimes you need to

00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:14,099
be humble enough to step back and say

00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,660
I'm not the right person to help you I

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,980
can't see this problem in a way that I

00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,650
can explain it to you that will be

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,539
useful to you and then stepping back and

00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:27,099
put connecting them with the right

00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:30,640
person that being said there is also

00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,720
that whole ego thing ego is is sometimes

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,160
rampant

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,290
our kind and I'm not gonna spend a lot

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,400
of time touching on that but I think

00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,990
that there is something else to be said

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,130
about ego in a completely different

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:44,290
fashion and that is not thinking enough

00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:47,050
of one's own accomplishments right not

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,599
having any ego at all like i said when i

00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,660
first started off of you know in summer

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,050
coat I had no experience I had no idea

00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,520
what I was doing and frankly it wasn't

00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,960
like there was any template or modeled

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,000
for me to work from because no one had

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,310
ever done it before and what we were

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,030
doing changed almost completely from

00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,500
2005 to 2006 in terms of workflow and so

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,090
you know people would come to me and

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,890
they'd say oh my gosh you're doing a

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,670
great job you know this is really cool

00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,619
what I'd say it thanks I try and I

00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,849
didn't believe him and then eventually I

00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:20,140
did it for a while and I thought hey

00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,849
this is pretty cool when I did believe

00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,859
them but you know there were a lot of

00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:25,690
you know kind of egotistical people out

00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,040
there and I thought you know I don't

00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,980
want to be one of those people running

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,080
around being very overly excited about

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,849
what I accomplished so people would give

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,880
me compliments and I go oh you know it's

00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:39,250
not a big deal oh yeah no it's cool like

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,490
know anybody could do this yeah no it's

00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,790
fine and you know that's not necessarily

00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,750
good either right I know I know a fair

00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,580
number of folks who are involved in

00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,980
community stuff who have that kind of

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,930
reaction and we have formed the mutual

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,839
adoration society to help ourselves get

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,790
over that and I think the really

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,900
profound moment for me was one day I was

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,200
sitting there talking to my friend Dave

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,020
d anderson and panel GSS see anyone know

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,520
who I'm talking about oh you guys do not

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,440
spend enough time in our IRC channel

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,200
come on down were nice we're friendly we

00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,640
serve you know cookies and I was you

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,869
know dave was telling me you know oh you

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,080
know you're doing great i'm like man

00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:18,339
he's like well Leslie you know you need

00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,750
to respect yourself in your

00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,040
accomplishments and I said you know Dave

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,980
I don't want to be one of those people

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,609
who runs around being overly pleased

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:30,010
with themselves and he's like Leslie

00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:33,700
humility is great don't deny the awesome

00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:37,900
and I went and I hemmed and hawed and he

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,430
said no Leslie humility is great don't

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,540
deny the awesome

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,710
and so I looked at him I thought about

00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,300
and I'm like you know what Dave that's

00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,250
really really good advice I appreciate

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,540
that where did you hear that and he's

00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:52,310
like yeah don't you remember when you

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:54,830
told me that like oh wait yeah now I do

00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,240
and that was the best experience I ever

00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:01,970
had of someone coating my own advice

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:06,040
back to me it's quite good you'll find

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:08,240
as you know your nutrition I love cats

00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,650
you'll find as you're working with

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,850
newbies and kind of you know pulling

00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,320
them through the whole process and

00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,360
getting them on boarded that eventually

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,800
they'll begin to feel confidence right

00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,330
and as they feel more and more

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,980
confidence they'll need less and less of

00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,350
your time to make them productive

00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,910
contributors right and for me myself as

00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,190
I got more and more experience I too got

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,560
more and more confidence and if you're a

00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,420
community manager again confidence is

00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,650
one of those extension aspects right you

00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,780
need to be the person who's there to

00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,150
lead the charge in matters that are non

00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:38,180
technical it matters that are technical

00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,590
it's pretty clear a lot of times you

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,750
know what the answer should be this

00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:44,690
patch caused regressions maybe not so

00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,250
much implementing a feature this way is

00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,190
going to cause a performance problem

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,080
maybe not so much it matters that aren't

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,760
necessarily technical aren't necessarily

00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,470
measurable this is where a community

00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,780
manager comes in and just makes a

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,750
decision right I think that we should

00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:02,480
market are you know latest event this

00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,660
way I think that we should structure our

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,000
program timeline this way and you need

00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,410
to just step out make a decision and not

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,380
only that but have the confidence to

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,850
know that you are going to make mistakes

00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,370
you are probably going to make a lot of

00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,660
mistakes in fact I guarantee you that

00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,850
you will make a lot of mistakes and

00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,710
that's okay you just need to have the

00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,060
confidence to know that you're going to

00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,680
be able to do it and that course

00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:30,380
corrections are a good thing when needed

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,120
I haven't talked anything about this yet

00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,310
but I'm hoping it's coming through in my

00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,480
articulation if you want to bring new

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,880
people into your project you need to

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,270
have passion I am incredibly passionate

00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,750
about what I do I cannot imagine having

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,940
a more awesome job I get paid to help

00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,650
students learn more about what they're

00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,200
really passionate about to become better

00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,539
computer scientists to get their awesome

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,599
dream jobs I get

00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:57,489
cool males like hey Leslie I just

00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,140
graduated from college and I just got

00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:01,150
married and I use my summer of code

00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:05,229
money for my wedding and I hope you can

00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,699
come whoa dude this is not you know

00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:08,919
these are not experiences that I think

00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:11,229
most people get to have and and you know

00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:13,029
what really helps me be passionate is is

00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:14,140
those experiences and that the awesome

00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:15,819
community of folks that i get to

00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,410
interact with right and the cool thing

00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:20,169
about that passion is that passion is

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,969
infectious that enthusiasm really draws

00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:24,400
people in they want to know what it is

00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:27,279
makes you so excited they want to be a

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,650
part of it right so have your passion

00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:33,459
feel your love and display that passion

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:36,789
and last but not least no one to ask for

00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:38,319
help I know like I said first year

00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:40,749
Summer of Code getting about four hours

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,009
of sleep a night it was not fun and that

00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:44,829
was mostly because I didn't know anybody

00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:47,049
right I you know I had no idea who all

00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,759
these people were and after a while I

00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,919
was reading more posts on the mailing

00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:52,209
list and spending more time in our IRC

00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:55,209
channel and really getting to know

00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:59,279
people I'm like okay has flu has clue

00:45:55,209 --> 00:46:01,269
reliable house clue judicious patient

00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:03,009
you're the kind of person who's going to

00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:05,140
get cranky later maybe not so much with

00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:06,609
you and you know and these are the kinds

00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,839
of people who you know when there was a

00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:09,219
flame we're starting on the mailing list

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,199
and maybe it wasn't the best time for me

00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:13,569
to step in him like hey dude yep got it

00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,880
you know our second year we had eight

00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:19,179
channel offs who weren't Googlers and

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,069
our IRC channel I asked the community to

00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:23,739
work with me to create documentation

00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:25,509
about advice for mentoring organizations

00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,949
and advice for students that we

00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:28,779
published as a resource for the program

00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:31,509
even though it's google's program

00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:33,969
because guess what I can't give good

00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:37,479
advice as a mentor or a student I

00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:40,390
haven't been one and speaking of asking

00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:43,029
for help we're going back to that lovely

00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:46,749
little picture of you know Paula trees

00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:48,749
my hero so mélange the mélange project

00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:51,099
as I said before is the next generation

00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:54,279
framework to manage the google Summer of

00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,869
Code program and we went out and asked

00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:57,069
the community for helping contributions

00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:58,599
because as I said we have about

00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,880
twenty-five percent of an engineer on a

00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,130
good

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,660
a and we were really excited when we

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,460
were actually able to take this project

00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,079
and make it a community-owned and

00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,480
community driven project just about a

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,119
month ago I'd like to introduce you to

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,809
Pavel so llego I've pronounced it wrong

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,950
again denied I'm terrible ladies and

00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:17,950
gentlemen sibel swager

00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,440
a two-time google Summer of Code student

00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,089
one time mentor for his own mentoring

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,180
organization and the gentleman who got

00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:32,289
the job washing dishes overseas instead

00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,030
of writing a free and open source

00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:35,680
software and he's going to give you a

00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,940
demo some of the features of Milosh so

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,039
if you want to do your own newbie

00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,240
outreach initiatives or externship

00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,609
programs you can see what the code base

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,789
looks like and see what you want to do

00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,770
with it or you might want to contribute

00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:50,020
because it's in python and django and we

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:55,690
have this shiny new web application but

00:47:50,020 --> 00:48:04,390
it's not really done yet justified you

00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:07,170
don't have to like okay guys I'll just

00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:10,539
do a quick demo what we have so far and

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:17,890
my lunch the resolution is not really

00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:19,800
great okay once again and yeah so one

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,630
second because

00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,340
yeah one moment please you're

00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,930
experiencing technical difficulties when

00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,640
if they continue for a long period of

00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,850
time I will annoy you with close harmony

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,850
singing

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,540
okay not sure work okay so i will sign

00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,730
out thank you and welcome to our sexy

00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,980
sexy sign in so i'm working right now

00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:47,610
luckily it's not deployed up to any

00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:54,240
Google App Engine servers right now I'll

00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:58,110
just sign in as user 10 that's ambitious

00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,700
yes and I see the homepage and I can

00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:04,200
create my profile I can type in my

00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,450
public name which is user account of

00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,970
course and just a link ID which will

00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:10,650
show up in the URLs this is actually

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,270
really really cool because with our old

00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,490
infrastructure every year you had to

00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:17,340
answer the same data over and over and

00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:21,210
over again you don't got it anymore he's

00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,920
good so we can have many google Summer

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,680
of Code projects in the same web

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,910
application and we can have G hope

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,140
projects and programs to and the same

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,580
application at the same time so if

00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,190
you're interested in doing a program of

00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,380
your own you can either have a proposal

00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,270
based workflow of her project work floor

00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,160
you can also a task-based workflow like

00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,380
you know do this one little small thing

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,770
for me ok it's done so depending on how

00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:49,730
you want to work your magic so here is

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,260
the what's user normal user sees and

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,730
user doesn't have any roles yet like

00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,790
he's not an organization administrator

00:49:53,730 --> 00:50:00,570
is not mentor student anything so

00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:03,870
basically it's just pure user side wide

00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:08,190
user and now I going to sign out as a

00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:11,430
user and sign in as a administrator of

00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:17,280
the of the mélange and now I see a lot

00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:19,440
more right so I have user as me I have

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,110
the site settings where I can edit site

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,780
settings I can place Google Analytics

00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:26,790
Google Maps API I can set the home page

00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,770
document if I have some documents i can

00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:31,050
just type in and nice autocompletion

00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:33,330
shows up and i can select the document i

00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,870
can set the feed URL that will show up

00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:40,450
on the main web page i can set the terms

00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:42,820
of service for both programs and

00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:53,920
and beside wide terms of service if it's

00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:57,940
needed I can we can we can create the

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,800
documents inside melange which we can

00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,430
then reuse for example inside settings

00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,869
we can set up this document as a

00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:06,460
homepage so for those of you who are

00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,510
actually participating in summer of code

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,980
right now do you know how we have

00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,640
documentation in like seven different

00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:14,380
places this is the part where you nod we

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,390
are gonna have documentation in seven

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,770
different places anymore and if you want

00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,680
to use this offer you don't have to have

00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,599
that happen to you either yep so we can

00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,930
what else we can do we can list users

00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:28,329
that's all that's only for admins but

00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:32,380
picking lets users and go through them

00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:33,940
that they need to what else do we have I

00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,390
think I think the chickens are restless

00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,890
yeah well okay so we have a few terms

00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,920
that need to be explained we have

00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:44,619
program owner which is a sponsor of the

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,030
program basically like Google is a

00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:49,150
program owner we can create a new

00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:51,940
program owner inside the application we

00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:55,210
have one already created here this

00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:59,319
program owners hey this is google

00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:02,710
frognal who is a program owner here it's

00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:06,280
created by folsom test user and the

00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:08,740
program owners can include program

00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,020
administrators so we can invite some

00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,400
user to become a program administrator

00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,839
what are we show them how to apply to

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,220
become an organization since that's

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,339
probably what most people are interested

00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:21,040
in applying to become an organization

00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:23,050
shown here actual size mentoring

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,400
organization applications yeah basically

00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:30,700
you see the form once you click Submit

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,400
less you can review the organization

00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,540
applications you can go and list and for

00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,700
those of you who are actually planning

00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,050
on applying as mentoring organizations

00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,819
to google Summer of Code all those

00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,319
questions that were scrolling by really

00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:43,000
fast or all the same questions you've

00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:45,760
had to answer for the past two years so

00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,869
no big surprises there yeah we can list

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,810
the programs that are currently in the

00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:54,200
system and we can edit the program if we

00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:59,680
want if we need to

00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,670
are we can create a new program no wait

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,650
so you can actually have multiple

00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:05,329
programs running on the same instance if

00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,040
you wanted to do two parallel programs

00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:08,720
at the same time which is very cool yeah

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:14,359
so I want to create a new program i can

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,770
select the program owner anyway the

00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:18,230
point is that it's really cool and

00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,550
awesome and shiny and you will be

00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:22,099
getting to use this if you are Summer of

00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:23,180
Code participant this year and you know

00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,520
if you would like to contribute to the

00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,170
project we would always love your help

00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,820
yep and that's basically that's it

00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,480
thinking we are looking for new

00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:36,500
contributors if you know python django

00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:45,230
CSS javascript or HTML we are looking

00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:47,570
for help hey you dudes oh yes feel the

00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,890
full screen love all right folks in case

00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,650
you haven't figured it out yes we were

00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,930
doing google Summer of Code 2009 there

00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,910
is the sexy new logo for this year is

00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,720
very pretty harkens back to the whole

00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,720
summer of love

00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:05,390
we like and we will be taking student

00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,510
applications on the twenty-third of

00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,340
March of 2009 so we will be creating all

00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,410
the functionality required in melange to

00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,940
take student applications which isn't

00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,400
necessarily there now but fortunately we

00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,380
can reuse a lot of the code if you would

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,630
like to learn more about applying as a

00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,930
mentoring organization or about applying

00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:27,109
as a student our FAQ s 4 2009 will be

00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:29,720
published tomorrow at code google com /

00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:31,970
SOC there's where to find out more about

00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,460
melange where to find out more about

00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,990
open sores at Google and check out the

00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,130
blog we spend a lot of time writing for

00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,770
it and you know we would love it if you

00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:44,740
would come read it and that's all I got

00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:44,740
any questions question

00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,579
alright hi hello so a lot of the linux

00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,020
users group within Scotland I've been

00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:59,800
wanting to do what you've done with high

00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:02,140
skills how do we go around doing that

00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,839
how do we get high school kids to start

00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,640
working on open source software okay

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,960
that's an awesome question so the

00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,000
gentleman's question was that there are

00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,980
a lot of Linux users groups in Scotland

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,109
and they'd like to take what we've done

00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,550
with high school students and replicate

00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:17,920
that model so how do you get high school

00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:20,380
students involved and free and open

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,670
source software development i would say

00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,730
that there are a couple different ways

00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,440
to do this one start really really small

00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:30,040
when you're asking people to do things

00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,630
make tasks discreet and make them

00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,700
something that you can accomplish with a

00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:35,740
couple of hours of effort and one of the

00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,300
reasons you want to do that is let's

00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,550
face it we all have the attention span

00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,560
of a gnat high school students are no

00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,640
different and the other reason you want

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,050
to do that is you want to give these

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,510
students a sense of accomplishment right

00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:48,010
this is a it's a very big world out

00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,290
there and it can be scary if you've

00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,760
never done it before and you still are

00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,829
very much entrench the idea of seeing

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,000
adults as authority figures and if you

00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:56,260
can actually prove that you can do

00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,910
something if you can have that sense of

00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,319
accomplishment if you can go back and

00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:01,150
say I've done this work and it was

00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:03,369
successful then you're actually going to

00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,630
find that that is what you know creates

00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:07,180
more energy and actually gets more

00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:09,550
people involved the other thing is don't

00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:12,310
give up right at first I mean I I had no

00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:14,109
clue again what I was doing with the

00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,359
highly open participation contest I just

00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:17,770
said hey let's get some high school kids

00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,440
working on open source project that

00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:22,420
sounds awesome and i also thought where

00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,180
do they meet I don't know where to find

00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,470
them I don't want to use Facebook well

00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,300
hopefully our friends will find them and

00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,880
that actually happened but you'll find

00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,920
that your momentum builds up more after

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,150
a couple people get stuff done and then

00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,010
all of a sudden you're gonna get a flood

00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,970
of people going oh my god this is so

00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,530
cool this is so cool i really really

00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,560
really really really want to do it but

00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,869
at first it's gonna be like radio

00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,670
silence and if you would like to get

00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:47,170
some expert advice on this topic we have

00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,540
a high school student contributor right

00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,250
over there who might wish to provide you
