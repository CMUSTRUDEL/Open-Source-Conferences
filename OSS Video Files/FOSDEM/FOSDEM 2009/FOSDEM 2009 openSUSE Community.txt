Russia I community member of opensuse

00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:15,089
today we are talked about on community

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:20,670
role in wall hole opens to the early

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:23,250
release cycle generalization Martin will

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,289

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:32,700
about spoil upcoming spokesperson

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:36,780
program so what is community what is the

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,110
open season I think opensuse was created

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,520
as community program it means

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,070
enthusiast's all over the world should

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,129
be able a significant role in the

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,320
process of development and promote and

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,570
opensuse as opensuse is promoting a

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,610
sponsored by neville and not all

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,399
employees do their heart daily work to

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,180
make distribution better but to achieve

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,610
the primary goal of the project we need

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,360
to involve for more our volunteers in

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:15,799
the process of development those who use

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:19,860
contribute to it and care about it so a

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:26,000
bit more about communities structure we

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:29,220
have users who use in heavy load on

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,770
about to thousands of them have signed a

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,770
guiding principles the principles where

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:41,630
the project goals are described and we

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,759
use a word member for person who make

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,159
continuous available contribution to the

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:53,820
project and of course sinut guiding

00:01:47,159 --> 00:02:00,560
principles we have about 260 approved

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:09,479
members they got some perks and able to

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:10,759
elect a next part in order to get member

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,010
status

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:19,040
are my contribution in following areas

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,900
like packaging bug reporting translation

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:28,340
and so on so watch the birdies are the

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,329
board a people who approve members a

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,870
while members vote for the board the

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:40,120
first board was created appointed by

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:43,099
Neville in 2007 the primary mission was

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:50,150
to create to propel election for the

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:54,139
next board the boat was created to lead

00:02:50,150 --> 00:03:06,379
the overall project so the board

00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:10,280
succeeded in and in the board X central

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:18,160
component of opensuse but doesn't make

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:28,489
any technical decisions so so much about

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:33,019
construction let see in a dep product

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:35,569
lifecycle basically we can divide a

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,930
product lifecycle and free logical

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:42,019
stages these are ideal stage testing

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,599
stage and release stage the community

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,799
can make proposals on issue of this

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:52,340
stage and each proposal or comment it's

00:03:48,799 --> 00:04:00,340
of beak importance for those who make

00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:02,510
the final decision at ideal stage

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:10,609
community and members are brainstorming

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:13,870
for new ideas are watch which are

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:19,290
important for the project are watch a

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:24,090
new feature it will contain and so on

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:27,510
oh and the beginning of this year tools

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,570
and services team was launched a new

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:36,950
feature tracking system the stool named

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:43,130
open fate with open fate we can create

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,130
fiction quest and requests it's

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,850
discussed any feature with our

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:57,660
interested people and developers we can

00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:00,770
vote for features we like a future

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,870
creation is allowed only four members

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:09,810
usual registered users can only comment

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:16,070
official they like with help of voting

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:19,950
system we can gather a most of

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:26,840
interested future and attract attention

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:31,260
of developers to implement them so

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,650
another our tool for gathering ideas we

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:39,600
have in june two thousand eight the

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:45,240
forum's team was created forums opensuse

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:51,240
work a place where opensuse community

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,760
can have support and discuss opensuse

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,650
relate related topics the forms was

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,320
created by measuring three largest

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,640
english-speaking forums and this is our

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:07,470
are novel forums are souza linux then

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,800
support there and to the forums net the

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:14,070
forum still team promised they won't

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:20,790
stop working to implement new features

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:25,010
of to extend community importance of the

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:29,040
most unneeded feature there it's a

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:32,139
language subsections for forums i think

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,219
because we need a consolidate our

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:40,889
local local community groups to at

00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:46,499
central point together a feedback from

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:54,669
non-english speaking communities so our

00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:58,419
about testing stage the most of the most

00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:01,479
of things done on this stage are done

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:10,449
with help of opensuse bill service at

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:16,479
this stage community k can taste i'm a

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:20,349
little paper packages mmm feeling bug

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,469
reports and so on at Build service we

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:28,979
have community extension repositories

00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:33,969
for KDE gnome and other various projects

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:38,159
the main problem is and now open to the

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:45,129
bill service contain about 10,000

00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:52,000
projects with about 60,000 project the

00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:55,330
current more the current model working

00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,759
with third party packages is complicated

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:07,659
to use so our own we plan to make a

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:12,779
central repository official central

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,779
predatory for community it names contrib

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:24,490
where we have our only one package only

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:28,479
one version because many projects we

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:32,260
have many many duplicated packages which

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,469
a bit confuses users which packet to

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,469
choose

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:52,670
oh yeah so mm-hm so within construe

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:57,130
preparatory we introduce two new roles

00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:01,820
it is a maintainer and review a

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:07,029
maintainer will create initial package

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:12,740
track changes in upstream while a

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:18,200
reviewer team a track package for

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:24,459
security issues stability of this all of

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:31,089
this I think we'll done with help of

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:36,170
social security team so with starting on

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:38,240
11.2 KDE free dot five will be created

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,730
complete completely by community and

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:50,270
supported by community tomorrow will

00:09:43,730 --> 00:10:00,050
deafen some we'll talk about it at this

00:09:50,270 --> 00:10:08,180
stage is important translations we've

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:12,800
made we have translation for LC and yes

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:18,890
translation weekend translations we plan

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:26,050
to introduce a language speech the

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:32,390
language specific on a news portal where

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:39,550
users from local communities can find

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:41,529
out what happened in opensuse world so

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:48,339
what about the release date early stage

00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:54,720
is the stage where we add the final

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:57,940
stage at this dish we prepare a mirrors

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,350
most of mirrors are created by community

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:05,190
for example in Russia we have now with

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:13,360
help of community two largest mirrors

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:20,230
with watch serve Ukraine and some part

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:27,070
of other asian countries at this stage

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:33,990
we have marketing team hosts have hard

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:49,510
work by appropriate release parties are

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:55,540
some release new entries so to help with

00:11:49,510 --> 00:12:00,160
this we we make introduce a spokesperson

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:04,329
with which can help to gather feedback

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:10,209
from our local communities and put this

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:13,899
feedback to global communities to to

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:16,779
find and you are ideas and you Thailand

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:20,950
and n a non-english speaking countries

00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:26,610
so our margin are you talking a bit more

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,610
about an inch a spokesperson

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,490
I don't expect I fear some more than

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:59,690
spoken maybe should i use as a

00:12:34,490 --> 00:13:11,839
microphone was it ok ok thanks ok all my

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:13,610
slides so ok I'm on so so we had the

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,500
overview of the community from dinner

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,330
and so a lot of stuff is going on for me

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,700
the most important thing which is

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:27,260
starting right now is a spokesperson

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,810
program so what do we want we want a

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,350
good name for it so at the moment we

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,150
have voting spokespersons really just a

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,250
placeholder so that's why we don't have

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,140
it in the voting books person is for me

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,790
it's it's the total useless worth it

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,740
when it describes what he has to do but

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,779
it's only one part of the job

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,910
description so if you're an opensuse

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:52,310
member go to the users page and vote the

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,660
voting time is pretty short I want to

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:59,270
start a program more or less next week

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,870
so we will release the name as project

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:05,110
meeting at half-past six next week on

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,110
wednesday

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:16,490
I'm coming to that yeah maybe so why we

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:19,030
need somebody as a spokesperson mainly

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,610
local communities are totally different

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,140
so Dina also said that for example I

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,060
have no idea what's going on in Russia

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,060
so we need somebody who was in the

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,860
country and talk with the people try to

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,200
combine the efforts of all the local

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,970
people so it's much easier to do that if

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,880
you have somebody who is working

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,400
directly from this country and most of

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,130
the Souza and moving stuff is coming

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,860
from Germany or America so we have

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,990
really no clue especially what's going

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:53,090
on in countries like Indonesia for

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:55,790
example another one what we try to

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:58,730
achieve is that help us should be better

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,800
recognize Dora valid we have we have

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,290
already some people qualified as

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,360
spokesperson or ambassadors but nobody

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,280
knows that I know that because I work

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,230
with them on a daily basis to get them

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,660
DVDs to get some t-shirts stickers and

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,530
all the stuff but they are not really

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,700
recognized on the opensuse community and

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,670
of course we want to create something

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,200
like an opposition Network so we have a

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,320
mailing list for example we will have a

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,120
mailing list for them and for me maybe

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,880
the most important thing is that we have

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,980
better redistribution it's quite hard to

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,250
get opensuse and smaller countries and

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,350
even in technology companies like India

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,420
if you don't live in a big city it's

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,940
quite hard to get opensuse because you

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,730
don't have internet or you have a very

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,370
very low band for sale so we need people

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,920
who we distribute opensuse with dvds and

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,470
actually the people are making a lot of

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,450
events and in South America India and

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,210
other countries so it's not a problem to

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,950
to distribute the dvds adjust the

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,560
problem to have one central point where

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:06,290
you can say okay you have 12,000 dvds

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:10,280
and just redistribute them so what

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,890
should the spokesperson should do be a

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,980
local contact for opensuse just simple

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:19,400
as it is promote opensuse of course and

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,940
promoters it's not really different

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,490
things you can promote your kind of

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,220
must make presentations because we don't

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:30,120
have the money to go to India for

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,130
presentation and so if you have a local

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,560
event make your own presentations make

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,800
your own booze if you can so a smaller

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,150
event like all right even on fast n is

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,490
not a problem because we are here with

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,590
30 people so it's no problem to set up a

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,000
booth but you're probably not going

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:49,380
every day to Australia or South America

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,950
also very important for us is because

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,360
not all of the events are part of the

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:59,280
big Linux event trackers so if you have

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,470
a small local event it might be

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,050
interesting for people but it's not on

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,180
the big schedule so please take care of

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,180
the events and let us know that there's

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,939
something promote you work of course if

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,390
you are a spokesperson everybody wants

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:20,339
to know what you are doing and bundle

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,680
the small orders of promo DVD so so who

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,199
can do it it's a community job everybody

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,569
can do it even but we have also some

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,000
people from novell for example from

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,950
Sweden we have a guy I guess also from

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,170
indonesia's who's who are doing the job

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,250
but basically it's a community job we

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,560
want to community doing the spokesperson

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,360
job you have to sign the guiding

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,870
principles which is for me pretty

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,030
important and I'm not sure about this be

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,380
in opensuse member actually there was a

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,810
discussion on the mailing list about

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,910
that should spokesperson be in opensuse

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,910
member or not and was not really a

00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,150
conclusion about that so at the moment

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,040
I'm I'm not sure about that and if

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,590
somebody says I want to be your

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,730
spokesperson I probably say yeah go

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,920
ahead of course you need some

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,080
communication skills you need to talk

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,360
with the people you can see it's quite

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,940
good here on a first and for example you

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,620
have to introduce opensuse you have to

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,730
show some stuff show Katie ignore

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,680
whatever so this is quite important and

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:30,090
of course any time but because in the

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,490
end it's still work and it might be not

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,410
that much work if you are have many

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,150
spokesperson for

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,030
three maybe four in Germany we need for

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,720
maybe four it might be a lot of work if

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,940
you're the only one in your country so

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,710
what will you get back I'm of course

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:52,170
fame many people I know here from frost

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,600
them you know them because they're doing

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,610
some stuff for opensuse so doing stuff

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,840
is quite important and that's also why

00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,960
people are doing for example a new

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,460
buffers here the second time I guess and

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,640
everybody knows him so you will get Fame

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,430
back you will get a special spokesperson

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,820
packet package for example will get

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:17,010
t-shirts you get posters dvds of course

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,380
but to be honest at the moment we don't

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,320
have it so we are thinking about it what

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,880
we can do we thought that we do send out

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,450
of the package every time there's a new

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,450
release general spoofs like stickers

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,840
like tuxes like all the stuff you can

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,140
give away we are working on to get some

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,300
budget for traveling even if you living

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,450
in a smaller country it's of course

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:45,210
better than we pay for the travel so you

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,760
don't have to pay for your own and you

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,680
get a direct no voids who's a contact so

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,960
if you have some problems you need new

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,600
stuff you can contact us directly and

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,840
don't have to go to some mailing lists

00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,570
and wait for the answer yeah but I have

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,870
to say you know the economy right now so

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,510
I'm not sure what we can do really but

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,420
really can do what we can do for sure we

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:13,710
have dvds and i will start on wednesday

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,900
with that calling for proposals how to

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,780
get rid of the dvds if you have a nice

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:24,120
event go to the marketing list and you

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:26,750
will see what we can do so where we know

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,670
the name will announce on wednesday i

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,530
will start the same day so you can apply

00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,040
on the marketing meaningless so if you

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,750
are interested in a spokesperson job

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,930
just send an email we will discuss it as

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,210
this autumn one thing I'm not sure about

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,590
how to separate it but probably in

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,440
Germany we have a very very strong

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,780
community might make not that much sense

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,720
that

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,060
we have 20 spokesperson people in

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,970
Germany because the country is not that

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,920
big so we will figure something out how

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,700
to limit at how many people we need and

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,030
we will see it next week and yes we have

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,540
DVDs so if you need dvds just send us an

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,010
email on the marketing list that's all

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,390
for the spokesperson program i'm not

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:15,040
sure if I really answered your question

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:19,300
and you can compare it with fedora

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,910
ambassador program and with ubuntu local

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,650
program local communities so we need to

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,840
really more people coming outside from

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,180
the community it's nice for the company

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,980
to send people to events but a it's

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,310
quite expensive be we cannot go

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,410
everywhere and probably see it makes

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,810
more sense to have local people for

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,940
example if there's an event in Russia I

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,500
it makes probably not that much sense

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,740
that we are going there was 10 people

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,440
when we have a local community like Dina

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:55,440
there that's all on the spokesperson

00:21:47,440 --> 00:22:06,610
program any questions about that good

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:09,240
you have anything to say but some

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,240
conclusion

00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:30,049
so in summary you see at the slide their

00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:37,460
community role is a big role in a whole

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:40,070
release cycle community will have take

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,669
their job at ids day each day stage and

00:22:40,070 --> 00:23:05,960
release stage so coming G is a very

00:22:43,669 --> 00:23:13,700
important questions so we how we involve

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:20,480
more people the problem is the problem

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:27,770
is we need some more tools by gathering

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:42,950
feedback from local communities so thank

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:45,110
you for listening so we have now a short

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,610
break is it right here on the next

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,610
attack starts in 15 minutes word

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,950
so we have 50 minutes for on to the next

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:01,700
talk and then we start with build

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,350
service tracks we have the rest of the

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,230
day most of the stuff is really develop

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:10,280
are related like build service like corn

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,900
syrup and like support system so if

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,380
you're interested in that come back and

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,380
