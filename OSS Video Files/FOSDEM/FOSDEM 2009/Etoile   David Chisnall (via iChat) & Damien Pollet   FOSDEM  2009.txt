	00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,340
you see me talking with on here at an

00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:22,660
event Miami I'll try to be earlier

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:28,540
better with we here but they're not at

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:42,910
the level of a voice in the window on my

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:44,530
face right so hokey now you see very

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,929
gambling when I going to talk about

00:00:44,530 --> 00:01:02,980
stars just by giving you a quick

00:00:46,929 --> 00:01:07,150
introduction which is so I can have a

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:10,930
nice life those hopeful family that

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:16,180
spanned two around nine sixty seven

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:20,230
against driving this the first inning of

00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:24,610
all subject line of the learning of the

00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,100
statement was really 129 main language

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,500
the meanest won't finish that doesn't

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,500
mean you wish

00:01:44,159 --> 00:02:08,619
several ways brushless motors classes

00:01:51,630 --> 00:02:14,130
very self has long very popular descent

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,130
two jobs with JavaScript parents most

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,500
something needs a solution major

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:38,319
Strasser had one that was hoping if I

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:41,700
can move on to that some it's full

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,790
talked animatedly to make this

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,160
assignment which uses this for the money

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,590
okay so you know they're able / that in

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,590
a summit Freddie all right let us rule

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,790
and the other things message center and

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:12,380
mr. vacuum I representing an objective c

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:15,620
which is so yummy differences in there

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,990
alone square brackets with us as well

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,880
brackets object to see you then to

00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:29,270
distinguish between seem like silk

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:32,930
magnetize impacts so you have three

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:37,220
types of message your messages will

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,400
adjust the messaging messages with

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,560
nonprofits the messages with alternate

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:50,260
realities which are we missing this

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:55,550
factor we manage and I guess no one's

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:58,370
refusal to live by this attack double so

00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,000
we can move on to the next line in the

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,000
program phone

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:11,099
so I need someone speak yeah just that

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:15,360
we were on the frog on website so this

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:18,810
is for clocks to right-wing Texas minus

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:24,330
the objective c you can also see is

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:26,460
there a while all that helps them and

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,550
it's false both there are out of control

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:36,169
statements on that message sending all

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:38,940
you can do to have addition executions

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,460
all of this is implemented in synaptic

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,889
meselson so if you want to have

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,550
something to look like a statement that

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:50,669
you just have boolean objects it proves

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,210
them through message and is not into

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,889
that one closure so if there's an

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,080
example here on the slide which

00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,169
instantly removing in order to improve

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,560
in the Box message little square

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:08,430
brackets there are blocking sprains so

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,039
these are just another night little

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:16,560
number later also strengthens that you

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:21,479
get the occupancy they're just turns

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,180
into an object when Lionel runs and this

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:29,760
object into bondage of ours and it

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,490
responds to a value message that is

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,650
positive sign you can see my users to

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,020
amend something like a plan

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,389
so this would be a matters when you

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,930
implement it on lock closure objects

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:51,400
itself which is that while true method

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:54,729
which takes the loop body is not and it

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,009
just returns the results of the standing

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,050
imagined message of itself and then

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:03,970
setting it through message to the result

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:10,530
of that the loop body so this does kind

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:19,710
of complicated it's basically a while

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:19,710
that sounds in the arts of thing just go

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:30,190
and just that this confusion area just

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,860
alert problems without needing to have

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,450
anything especially not any land imagine

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,240
there's no special up there is 2013

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:46,490
National is a very integral and

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:49,880
recognize messages moving objects so all

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:54,110
you need is two subclasses is booting

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:57,800
true plastic bottles that proved us

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,660
implement this if proved necessary by

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,560
setting a value message into the

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:07,790
argument and false one commencing by

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,740
doing nothing so that if you want to do

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,320
any kind of conditional you get a mess

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,040
the method that returns instance by the

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,160
true or gods and then all of this vision

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:24,260
120 miles and is kind of if you use this

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,960
isn't an exact opposite this defines all

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,730
of this kind of message sending into

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,700
that the functions and small talk is

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,530
exactly as expressive it works from the

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,570
other end in mind what kind of things

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,250
that you can create this in terms of the

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:46,360
kind of things that you would do micro

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,360
celery that's so next

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,759
so objective-c I guess as a language

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,499
that much in this room nice and

00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:04,020
is there in one game who's not used

00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:06,870
objective-c loves everyone subjective

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,439
see is basically the last dose Brandon

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,509
seemed to enjoy that's one to try again

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,219
if you when you see in schools all

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,099
together into a single room with you

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,469
really see programmers to learn it which

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,409
is basically love the dozens of times in

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,810
extensions and it's really easy small

00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,879
talk workers to them basically Justin

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,629
smartly season I will stand up in this

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,880
module brothers but it's not as an

00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,680
object language for thousands we will

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,079
talk is that a key other object oriented

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,709
languages and has nothing with

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:42,870
acknowledging objective-c has been

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:46,670
supremacy flood of structures would you

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:51,510
from your place in my division and

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:55,470
smoking doesn't adjust as the master

00:08:51,510 --> 00:09:00,389
sample and Objective C isn't that

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,699
bastard's small flaw the reason

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,190
objective-c was created with this mortal

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,990
with to slug that leaves on the ring

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,810
achieve machines they're available in

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,269
the early eighties I guess now that is a

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,279
problem that's calculations and

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,959
lasting machine than with a client

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,529
workstations lends more daughters

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:22,139
created but it's still advantage of you

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:25,920
got some processor intensive objective-c

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:30,060
is a precise network is possibly the

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,690
right democracy is possible that's fast

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,839
it's also possible to write me some

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:40,950
student now our objective c losing a

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,960
central valley and get right in school

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:48,580
so one of the head results i have the

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,250
land is athletic women artisans and they

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,000
have no sanitation small talk which uses

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,550
a sensible blue blazer confirmation a

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
diversion objective c which uses the

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,580
naive brandy recursively templating

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,720
engine some pretty much and by the time

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:14,440
you get to around the 20th imagine of

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:20,320
multiple versions starting to feel so

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:22,270
that's like this so small talk why do we

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,510
want to listen talk is about the

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:28,360
pragmatic thought so I gas station and

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,200
bundling the widest holding tension

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,600
spring and also especially advantages

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,790
over objective-c it's a really simple

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,959
leg which you have the venue that stuff

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,600
if you see it has the same advantage

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,940
even objective signals render using your

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,810
object oriented remote there's very few

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,750
degree it's very easy to understand read

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,209
the message expressions as long as being

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,270
the islands I'm sensible then you can

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:01,810
kind of get the good we may learn bottom

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,440
edge this message is slightly doesn't

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,010
job of which

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,220
insert object and around that you have

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,370
to try the documentation to work on when

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,230
you order the parameters going from what

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:20,660
designers action and curious focus that

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,430
programmers we night small talk because

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,130
it matches very well with objective

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,470
season is really to bridge the two

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:33,200
because they likely happen this select

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:36,050
that would you miss parameters like not

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,020
next slide and down stop talking class

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:44,140
for too long and generally they'll talk

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:48,320
a bit about the subject of aesthetics so

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,240
we first included this as our beautiful

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,360
a book like warrants in the end of last

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,210
year and two started working on

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,000
compiling small tourism target the

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,420
objective is the aim the Iranian

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,890
government and the current value has now

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:11,600
struck upon that started working using

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:16,070
very simple get my cream cones as if not

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:20,620
members in this is a third generation is

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:26,750
used to but it had quite a few they

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:29,090
didn't do a lot of the things so I kind

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,320
of blackberry pie co-producing the base

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:36,950
important message not much we opened

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,900
the new versions will talk about LP and

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,970
this has a key advantages healthy a

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,630
massive massive optimization over

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,140
Toronto that it can produce that info

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,230
that it as a justifiable life so the

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,380
same rag mattox won't talk in the

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,890
process as the just-in-time compiler if

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:01,630
used to produce object code youtube link

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,630
the external tank we've seen programs

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:15,470
and abuses next 90 so the magnetic

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:19,490
small-clawed compiler is actually built

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,160
answer for this business language in it

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,130
which is a new framework in it running

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,930
which is designed and reducing dynamic

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,770
language with one of those ridgid artist

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,350
objective-c rightly so this contains a

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:39,170
set of then you island abstract syntax

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:41,720
to the masses and then a few local

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:46,520
libraries and frameworks and several

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,860
moments so those are abstracted basic of

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,210
generators this time the only one that

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,970
exists which is based on LVL this takes

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,640
this implement and purging writer and

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,940
licensed a series of messages which will

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,390
engage students with sense wins when

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,010
driving blind

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:10,010
probably sometime in the next few months

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:16,910
notarized interpretive Atlanta lead to

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:20,270
much more like great value it has its

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,850
own small round time like remix song

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:29,210
about a little bit more next few slides

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:32,000
this handles its of the bits the deleted

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,030
the black did lights were on but that

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,450
are provided by the new objective c

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,570
right and it also supports loadable

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,090
plantains and also the various different

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,700
languages the only one that we have this

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,770
really stable at the moment is mortal

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,570
which is why stalkers for pragmatic

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:56,780
mortal but 12 special eggs being working

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,780
on with another one since Christmas

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:04,010
these frames which is a JavaScript

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:06,860
islands and we have to say from next

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,950
government there's also a command-line

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:15,220
tool etl see what they have in language

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:17,990
lab which is wrong neither driveway for

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,760
complaining run exactly a new point and

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,960
this doesn't view the context of

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:28,610
syntactic sugar so open string down the

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:31,550
hatch ! like a top of the line so you

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,750
can use this to ranch elsewhere this

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,990
xbox or using the reduced and frameworks

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,360
and it supports logic bubbles so you can

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:45,390
put it up that bundle there does a

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,850
little bit of packing make the 911

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:51,850
method in a spy for which are bubbles

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,630
parks and so we have about ability to

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,760
grant applications purely in sport or

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,920
with no need to compile in the tour you

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,530
just distribute the Dogman bottle and as

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,750
long as language with its theater at

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,560
sore thumb typing machine you can just

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:15,550
double-click on the workspace local just

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:17,770
one so next time please so one of the

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,130
aims for this was trying this more

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,470
because small is beautiful by the user

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,910
to test a basically brand of them to

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:30,040
understand that this slides assuming the

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,010
what you see when I see if detected sync

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:39,090
this flesh of the show you exactly how

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:44,350
penises so if I start at the bottom the

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:46,600
total amount of code produced the most

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,860
part of this old things for language

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:56,830
it's all the runtimes is jumps under

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,180
announcements I promote and better

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,010
perspective people watching this is

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:05,410
around like Mike Ruiz about to add both

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:08,520
analyzing the cover so this compiler all

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:14,080
the new start is less than we have in

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,570
America today we do MC other so the

00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,339
small talk specifics around after a

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:26,740
house of my style

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:26,740
that other app

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:10,179
the reason by the way this is the last

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,240
language I'll be honest written and

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:17,799
although there are sea by winter valve

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,070
in every horrible thing instead of above

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:25,510
since Objective C has this nice ability

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,990
to go over languages we just use C++

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,880
natively bad and this is another really

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,679
nice thing about magnetics mobile

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,559
ordering from use of genetic see visibly

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:43,179
were abhorrent mugging nicely judgment

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:47,910
right some lemon on my glass you know

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:49,809
jective see Steve the Austin possible

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:54,360
functions in any language for NASA

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,360
select items for the legendary

00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:05,219
so the next time peace all right just

00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:28,479
talk to that song except with you see

00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:33,279
programs as objective-c and that'll my

00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:37,059
smile appointment into liquid myself

00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,909
early but when you do need it that is

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:43,629
really special to you send a message for

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:45,609
an object I'm small talk the object

00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:49,179
whether the receiver is a small mortgage

00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:53,109
at geneseo object it doesn't matter look

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,989
original objective c objects yes exactly

00:19:53,109 --> 00:20:00,879
the same line structure when you can fly

00:19:55,989 --> 00:20:03,099
the glass from gospel yes sleep module

00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:06,159
structures around at night we understand

00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:08,889
and expect to get from this generator

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,309
your objective c so there's no good

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:14,289
because no bridging that has no overhead

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,139
for sending messages from objective-c

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:20,580
piece of rocks walk talk to object or

00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:20,580
see that's just a breeze

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:39,220
when I got all this baggage and the

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,919
reason for this is the multiple way it

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,380
works is by using the time select and

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,990
information that we do right now as in

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,110
what I runs that guys and the Apple runs

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:54,070
I doesn't know so we can do Ramstein

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:58,179
every selector as a day magnetite the

00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:03,210
subject and you can get this information

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,210
really easily a wrong time you claim

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,460
usual the message expansion stuff like

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,630
that exactly all types and that expects

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:19,120
so it's more talk everything's fine art

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:22,330
objects around lenders that's but often

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,429
when you're flying objects UFOs then one

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:29,650
or more of the parameters you want to

00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:31,990
pass will connect the germs so all

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:37,720
integer types are box is this special

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:43,559
sporting primitive in language and this

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:46,030
is the sort of pseudo object which is

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,059
it's basically an integer the store

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,039
pointer so the loosing it is sent to one

00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,900
and when you want to perform any

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,070
requisite we think you just might shift

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:59,190
in one do you reckon 10 and then shifted

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,250
and all

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:06,780
deterring maintenance very short I mean

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:09,060
that compiled well via new code but then

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:14,190
when you can to perform any of those

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:17,010
operations the compiler just generates

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:21,510
close to those functions in albia unless

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:31,260
them for more complex types like

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:35,730
structures they're all box methods in

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,930
value Brenda managing money value settle

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,930
at the objects together

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:49,799
ask for example a string to some bad

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:55,169
news antigen love to what many random

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:57,299
enemy but it's not human I know this is

00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,690
object except I'm not a percent leave a

00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,220
message and do that Chronicle networks

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,940
as onto the object in the men's game

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,440
value method that returns made then a

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,239
long one so you use strings and integers

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:19,080
and slatwall interchangeably and

00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:23,070
automatically next so there are tons of

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:27,119
makes the differences for tomorrow with

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,999
negative values and the first one of

00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,690
these is blogs or top users blocks

00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:36,480
everywhere their first loss objects that

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:39,690
are slippers you money if we need to do

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,149
is walk involved blocks and the other

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,330
one is not local returns and these are

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:48,480
really missing features go to where if

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:52,200
you have a return statement of long then

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,059
when it's encountered good methods when

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,789
the block was declared return so you

00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:03,450
need to producers that one day just

00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:06,929
think next lab so

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,720
this little cooks offences value for the

00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,779
math operation pragmatics portal

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,299
disarray by the last dance the rain god

00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,429
certain categories of mess around four

00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,649
gentlemen some of these methods and

00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,899
that's what the small talk sport I'd

00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:25,350
really like this day of them like bounce

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:29,909
miles or so this takes a block which and

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:35,279
one on this argument and it sent it to

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:39,120
do merciful medicines a message entering

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:44,120
the direct inter but then it creates a

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,120
new array which names in this block

00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:51,899
there's a translation so that's long

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,240
sounds as though the problem is when

00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:57,000
you're doing this event in the vault you

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,130
need to be able to create or what smart

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,480
and if we have to do a heater patek

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:08,549
edging every single time abandon that so

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,700
every time you create a blog veteran

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:14,279
it's compiled to a monkey and the

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,309
punchin expands the blog is it / target

00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:23,370
and that's just like any other medical

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:26,580
terms of sea salt on the block object

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:30,360
itself we are nexus 10 and that's fine

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,490
and it will also vote on share the

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,820
context object which doors boarded the

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,820
lovers

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,230
some reason that the clutter problem is

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,929
that now you have not yet which some

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,809
might want to retain allocated

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,539
understand so what happens if impulsive

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:54,179
law as an argument to the methods and

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,940
receiver says on the anthems collective

00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:00,590
is very and making two stores bring

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,539
something and then your method returns

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,770
and that frame has popped off the stack

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:11,970
and next thing I use it you just read

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:16,789
from a random sample nations take your

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,789
ordinary so that's kind of a problem

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:25,250
alluding to that is now whenever you

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,250
said varitek messaging to block object

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:31,169
block is commonly but if you remember

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,539
the last night the block itself is a

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:37,590
service object all it does is have a

00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:42,659
white content text where one of the very

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:46,289
consistently so we do some Isis

00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:51,870
whistling there so that context which is

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:56,100
a stand is changing and appointed unto

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:59,669
the reform of Texas storm somewhere else

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,929
that when this number times the block on

00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:06,660
texts provide an accident laughing so

00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,169
the lowest variables being accessed on

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:18,600
the staff that local very nicely went to

00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:25,980
Malta staff then they are still watching

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:31,169
and next time so the other things not

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:37,490
our concern so you can often see methods

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:37,490
like this you have some additional

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,630
message that you return so this will be

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,419
just like an objective give some

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,460
condition result true then that's final

00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:54,990
objectives even control of her statement

00:27:50,460 --> 00:28:03,090
said context but it's also this return

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:04,770
true statement my hands and this was not

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,429
true statement should return from

00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,590
methods not just me wrong so when you

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:16,220
can do that is to have a new second hand

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,250
with us down which is partly

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,080
so with the news eric koston second that

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:31,130
we made the eyes that are caring and

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:33,890
love students like systems they let you

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:41,289
associate personality on every stunt

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:46,820
drivers just or debugging methylated and

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:50,900
this is called consents this is some

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:55,400
executive one time on what we stand for

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:58,159
this frame and this brother if the

00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:14,350
success you've become but this frame

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:20,289
then and that's all this to still catch

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,289
objective-c exciting musical style

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:31,690
executive law it's not exception do I

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:43,720
have you managed one exclusive launch

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,720
receiver that

00:29:45,360 --> 00:30:36,150
so we can plan our vacations the melody

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:42,960
application which American working on

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:59,320
it's a music box it's running so it uses

00:30:42,960 --> 00:31:02,020
my individual music man so that us my

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:06,150
friend Missy agree on with this Arab

00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,150
gypsy and then go

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,700
small talk code one objective c excuse

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,890
me classic so we've got the huge

00:31:13,700 --> 00:32:00,320
selection of a new school users will use

00:31:18,890 --> 00:32:02,630
its object which is this right so i

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,390
guess must give the menu right here has

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,539
written objective-c adjusted my new set

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:13,000
of Mendel's on existing dance of those

00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:13,000
humans in place testing them

00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:28,609
and that's great that's because this so

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:32,649
we can I passenger in subjective see

00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:35,529
optimist so I said it Cutler slides ago

00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:40,429
objectors the objects but really the

00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:45,559
progenies there are objects which have

00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:50,349
some madness in most of these American

00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:56,629
and as magenta side burners on time but

00:32:50,349 --> 00:33:01,579
and so any one of these objects as some

00:32:56,629 --> 00:33:05,719
mixtures module objectives methods and

00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:09,169
we do that now and applications we going

00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:13,489
you directly one night while I'm making

00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:17,649
which elected by advocate and it should

00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:20,559
market rally and the new version two

00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:24,949
presentations red team is expecting and

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,219
they also have a language for you so if

00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:32,299
you have any troubles with an LP by

00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:35,380
extension application of eternity then

00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:39,160
assume a patient

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:43,920
science and even think it to existing

00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:49,390
applications they were nice and some

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:51,940
messages so I guess we're all in the

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:55,060
book itself I believe every summer

00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:11,580
school at free software foundation two

00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:14,290
times free software by three and they

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,409
qualify this by setting access the

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:21,090
source code is a precondition but now

00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:25,450
for us extra sort of decent print issue

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:29,950
with language in plugins there you don't

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:35,760
need access to get inspected by to

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:38,800
replace existing application at runtime

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,090
you can still distribute your money

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:47,909
pages just another language in my any

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:56,399
user to anything use that not attained

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:56,399
without me a resource like

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:30,080
so this is which lets you look far is

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,660
the Metrozone masters that's you given

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:40,700
that something you used environments

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:44,480
weeks of grinders next so this does give

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,850
a segment I like not browser you saw in

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,570
the screening arms is driven by an

00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:59,230
inspection so this will renew gradual

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:59,230
fastest of the fast so you don't

00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:06,319
any last amendment in your own

00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:12,079
insecurities and the sources of source

00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:16,430
code is available players the distance

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:21,950
you can still write a category that will

00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:24,319
replace our method and it does some nice

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,009
tweaks one of the ways air than two

00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:31,430
weeks ago with abstracts immensely

00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:40,839
practical things and a class using this

00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:43,249
now so you can find it if you just if

00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:46,670
you're an instance variables to an

00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:54,469
existing parts then or still want to be

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:58,890
able to do it does is as is it it's very

00:36:54,469 --> 00:37:13,920
much and it turns into a VC

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:16,769
so instead of variables variables to

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,799
existing objects is not some kind of

00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:21,799
municipal bonds where they have very

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:35,400
existence a written language is rampant

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,779
in the application menu develop the

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:44,930
button and you press that pops up nice

00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:44,930
so that application

00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:30,970
so feel free to contribute your

00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:34,029
Christmas list which is Travis

00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:41,380
temptation so if you probably twine

00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:49,920
objects this setup long as the method of

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:56,010
objects use an extra in a stands for

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,010
instance and that's actually expect

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:20,060
so health campus optimizations already

00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:22,730
generated and Martin and that person is

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:28,610
not near as fast as in Clinton there's

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:30,820
lots of redundancies honest its values

00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,350
rattling of the medallion plasters

00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,050
something's we've replaced by doing that

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,350
Fox it week that's where method one last

00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:42,500
week which will cover improve messages

00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:46,570
to just the various treatments so if you

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,570
guarantee when you through message

00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:53,290
doesn't respond to that message then

00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,280
Darren another box comes wants us dead

00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:35,970
and just boy asked questions a few

00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:42,849
people i should mention the bottom

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:47,079
obviously I virgin drank the options

00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:53,440
exactly and the real great battle

00:40:47,079 --> 00:41:00,930
possible trust Israel two passes that

00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:06,460
works which is this rumor has it sweet

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:09,990
but Nikolas nice variety barracks room

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,990
with us two applications

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:57,260
yeah what I was thinking is maybe we we

00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:02,720
prepare replacement for tomorrow and

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,790
maybe merge this one short version of

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:13,520
this one with the iphone a steady-state

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:16,340
a story I just got interesting what

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,240
happens really dynamically t of motor if

00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:24,220
you compile it is it still there will it

00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,220
get frozen somehow

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,750
yes

00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:48,549
someone in the planning on adding very

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:52,509
soon is the ability to the shared object

00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:55,900
file from the small talk but involvement

00:43:52,509 --> 00:44:17,739
is loaded my language last time and as

00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:19,239
long as it hasn't changed so I don't

00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:23,170
know if you have some other questions I

00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:28,329
can answer them robbery but that's a

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:31,930
problem and then idea I will yeah we

00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:34,839
found a version of this whole ball

00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:39,630
tomorrow and try to be able to answer

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:49,619
more questions about the story

00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:49,619
