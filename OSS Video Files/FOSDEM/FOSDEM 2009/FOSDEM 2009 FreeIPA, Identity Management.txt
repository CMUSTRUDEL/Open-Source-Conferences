Free Software Identity Management challenges and technical details

The presentation will revolve around the problems of building a modern Free Software based Identity Management Solution. The challenges we faced in trying to combine security, ease of used, standards, features, and interoperability with other solutions. The choices we have made for the current code base, and the choices we are facing going forward. The vision and future directions. The presentation will introduce the public to the technologies used, the modifications or additions we performed and will dive into technical details about how we architect the server and the future client components.
