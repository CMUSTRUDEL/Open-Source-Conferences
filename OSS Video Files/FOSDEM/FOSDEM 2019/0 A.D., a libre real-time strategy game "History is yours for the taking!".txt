0 A.D. is a free and open-source game of ancient warfare. It is a real-time strategy game which can compete with the classics of the industry, but comes with absolutely no cost for the players. Come and discover your new favorite game! We will present the game, its features and beautiful art, and its completion state: the game is fully playable, with a challenging AI for solo players and a fully-fledged multiplayer experience. It is an ideal playing field for hackers of all kinds, who can contribute to its development, create game mods, or use it for a completely different purpose. We will share our plans for the future and talk about how we got here, from the first idea of 0 A.D. to our latest release, available on all the desktop platforms. 

From 500 B.C to "0 A.D.", History is yours for the taking! Play with thirteen civilizations from the Mediterranean world and build your military base from the bottom up to achieve supremacy on the map. Team up with friends, crush your enemies, and enjoy living History as you make it yours.

Nicola who's going to talk a bit about

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,730
the game 0ad which is a liberal realtime

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,050
strategy game and the slogan is history

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,810
is yours for the taking

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:27,160
right good luck the stage is yours hello

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,160
does this work yes I'm here

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,379
so welcome everybody to this

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,690
presentation thank you so much for

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:53,120
attending it so I'm Nicola over there

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,449
and I am the project leader of 0ad

00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,320
which is a free open-source realtime

00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:04,699
strategy game that you may have heard of

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,430
if you don't 0 it is a real-time

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,710
strategy game so you might compare it to

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,000
old commercial titles like edge of

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,869
vampires or Warcraft Starcraft this kind

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,030
of game basically you have a base a

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:23,960
military base that you have to build up

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,869
develop make it flourish economically

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,929
and then you can crush your opponents on

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:32,060
the battlefield but the important thing

00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:34,039
is that your ad is not a clone of those

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,420
commercial games you might know it's

00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:42,110
really a completely original game which

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:47,030
is made by us on our free time as a free

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:49,369
and open-source piece of software it's

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,890
more precisely it's a history call

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,560
strategy game set in ancient times hence

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,930
the name zero ad in the Gregorian

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,100
calendar zero it doesn't exist you go

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,860
straight from 1 BC to 180 0 ad is like a

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:10,009
time that never was in which you can

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:15,769
play big civilizations from 500 BC to 0

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:18,079
ad as at the peak of their influence and

00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:21,260
prosperity in the mid in the

00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:23,600
Mediterranean world and beyond so we

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,980
have 13 factions that you can play in

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,260
the game from from the ancient world you

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,140
have the Athenians in alphabetical order

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,190
the Britons the Carthaginians the goals

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,489
the GI variants the crew sheets the

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,459
Macedonians the mauryas the patient's

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:47,930
the Potala means this the Romans the

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:52,310
Seleucids and the Spartans so you have a

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:55,700
wall word of ancient civilization that

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,620
you can control make them

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,590
in achieve supremacy on the battlefield

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,760
and really history as you as you make it

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,099
yours as 4-0 ad itself in this

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,310
presentation about from the world map we

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:12,800
just showed this is only in game footage

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,410
the game really looks like this I will

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,900
try to show you a video a bit later in

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,630
the presentation so the game is

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,030
beautiful and also actually fully

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,950
playable we advertise it as in

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,590
development because we still want to add

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,340
features to it but basically you can

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:39,049
play alone or with friends and the game

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:42,769
is almost complete in terms of solo

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:46,220
games you can play against the computer

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:48,769
against the powerful AI which is rather

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,930
difficult to beat the first time so

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,760
maybe take a couple games before you

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,599
increase the difficulty of the AI but

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
it's really working well here you see a

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,670
game played by four different a is

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,620
playing against each other and in the

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:12,440
mute multiplayer aspect the game is also

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,540
a feature packed we have a multiplayer

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,450
mode which works locally if you want to

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,700
organize a local arena game we have a

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,160
multiplayer lobby with a very active

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,919
community so you can just come and have

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,160
a game and be crushed if you're still

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:31,570
starting with the game or you can play

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,340
with with a friend with direct IP

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,169
connection we have some features that

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,720
even commercial games don't have

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,760
especially in multiplayer we have a

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,430
feature in comes in case you have a bad

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,710
Network you can join during a game or

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,960
rejoin if you get disconnected because

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,190
of your network this is a feature that

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,970
you can't find easily even in games that

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,520
are not made just for fun we have a lot

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,789
of other features from multiplayer like

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,250
replays of seven modes the chat in game

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:06,260
obviously the ranking on the logic is

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,620
done with the same system as for chess

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,510
if some of you play this

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,220
you have a friend system and much much

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,660
more finally of course if I'm here at

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,020
first them to present the game is

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,320
because 0 ad is free open-source Libre

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,640
if you prefer and cross-platform you can

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,190
play it on Windows Linux BSD Mac

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,620
anything you use it works it's in most

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,880
package managers as sorry package

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:41,750
repositories and it's free under the

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,230
code is written the GPL and all the art

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,770
is licensed under Creative Commons so

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:52,910
this is really a game made by volunteers

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:57,380
for the users in all meanings of of the

00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:00,620
world another thing that is made

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,350
possible by this openness of the

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,920
development of your ad is the mobility

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,860
of the game we have a lot of mods this

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:16,060
one is a bit dark sorry we have a lot of

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:19,820
mods and thriving modding environment

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,190
here some screenshots of tera magnum

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,040
which is a mod that adds civilisations

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,140
from the ancient world from outside

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,200
Mediterranean world here you have the

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,160
Chinese from the Han Dynasty the

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,160
Zapotecs from Central America and the

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,320
show me new nomads from Central Asia

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,830
those are added in each era Magnum mud

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,580
we have millennium ad which is obviously

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:50,020
a mod of the the medieval civilizations

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:54,920
in the AG a tribute to Age of Empires 2

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,290
and we also have this mod which is

00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,780
entirely different but has a lot of

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,480
success which recreates the world of The

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:07,880
Legend of Zelda in the engine of the

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,490
race so really the modding capabilities

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,950
of our engine are a big selling point

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,580
for for the region for everything and

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:19,610
and for everything we do with that and

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,390
actually in the latest version of the

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:26,160
0ag which was real

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,530
mid the 2019 we partnered with dot IO

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,170
which is a new service provided by the

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,230
creators of in gdb and mud ZB I don't

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,340
know if you know this website but we

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:40,980
partnered with them to bring modes

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,560
downloader inside zero ad

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,110
so basically mud that IO provides us

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,620
with a website where mothers can upload

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,350
their mods and we use their IP their API

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,190
to download mods directly into the game

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,250
and this has been a huge success we have

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,950
a lot of mud some of them are official

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,860
made by ourselves and some of them are

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,010
made by the community in nine months of

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:13,710
existence since May of 2018 when I

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:16,800
created these slides we were at 42,000

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:22,470
downloads and we are slowly but steadily

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:25,080
going to the 50,000 downloads as you

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:28,520
could see in the few slides I presented

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,590
you the art of the rarity is a very

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,580
important thing for us we are very lucky

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,010
to have great artists who contribute

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,860
like voluntarily and create their art

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,110
and their content and their assets under

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,660
the Creative Commons license and it

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,570
allows us on top of the the graphics

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,600
capabilities of our online to provide a

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:56,100
game that is beautiful to see beautiful

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,070
to play and I will also give you an idea

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:04,140
of the beautiful music we have by

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:08,300
presenting you some excerpts from the

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,300
trailer of the latest version

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:18,370
so the entire soundtrack is composed for

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,330
0z by another composer played with real

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:27,430
instruments and if you want to come to

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:30,250
our booth in the K building we can give

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,810
you City South cities of the soundtrack

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:40,020
of the game so those are some major

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,020
features from the latest version and

00:09:40,110 --> 00:10:16,150
actually in game footage

00:09:42,200 --> 00:10:19,010
[Music]

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,110
this is the latest CV zation that was

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:27,730
added to the game which is the kingdom

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,730
of cush from ancient Egypt

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:46,520
[Music]

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,820
each civilization of 0ag comes with a

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,550
full set of models for buildings and

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,740
units there are not a lot of difference

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,980
in the gameplay between the factions but

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,980
it's an entirely different experience

00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,980
visually

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:28,360
[Music]

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:40,340
[Music]

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,029
[Music]

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,940
we have a map editor which comes with

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,670
the game in which you can create maps

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,870
like placing elements on the map and you

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:21,050
also have a powerful API for scripting

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:26,750
RAM random maps random map generation so

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:34,360
I hope this gave you the the idea to

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:38,720
download the game and play it at home so

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,620
you probably wonder how we got here in

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,800
the first place

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:48,140
so it all began in around 2000 where the

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,910
original developers of the raid he

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,260
actually created a mod for Age of

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,480
Empires 2 which was a huge hit so they

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,640
decided to do something even bigger and

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,840
even more successful and they created

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:07,640
zero ad as a entirely different game

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,640
it was first the aim was to create a

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,810
game that was free as in free beer

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,810
because they came from the muder

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:22,730
environment but in the end they decided

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:27,230
in 2009 to go open source and libre buy

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:30,980
at the same time which allowed the game

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,680
to be developed very way further than

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,380
was anticipated and we're still going

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,320
strong and creating new content and new

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,310
features for the game which is actually

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,610
no almost finished and so we were global

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,370
team of people from all over the world

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,470
creating this game so if by any chance

as a central repository we host

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,180
ourselves but we have get mirrors on
