We at Juno track a massive fleet of taxi cars in a relatively small area of New York. For all the internal mapping we use OpenStreetMap — and we are naturally interested in it having zero road errors. One way to ensure that is to validate it against tens of thousands GPS traces we get every day. In this talk we'll look at the relation of traces and map data in OSM, find a few ways to improve OSM using these traces, and see the validation system we made.

hello everyone so I am Illya slave and I

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,439
come from OpenStreetMap most of you know

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:29,649
what opposite map is it's open map which

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:31,970
everyone can paint and opposite map has

00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:35,210
one issue

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,960
well not exactly one of his millions of

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,879
problems but this one comes from the

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,219
nature of the project it's the biggest

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,949
one opposite map is open data and to

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:52,219
make open data you have to rely on even

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:57,140
open ur data like public domain level of

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:59,629
open and the sources for Open Street Map

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,890
is very hard to find because of this

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:07,600
because there is very few sources which

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:11,090
are open enough for Open Street Map and

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,530
this hindered the development of a I

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,950
move for a very long time in the start

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:22,310
because first CTS were drawn using only

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:26,930
Landsat imagery which is very crude like

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,380
15 meters per pixel and Manilla

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,350
collected GPS traces which are also not

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,420
great but you can see that at least they

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:41,990
make a road network you can trace GPS

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,540
traces are still considered the main

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,020
source for Open Street Map they are

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,520
featured very prominently on the website

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,940
there's even a link for them

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,660
people are still uploading the them not

00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:00,380
many just hundred today or so but still

00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,960
and people are tracing over GPX their

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,280
primary source which means all other

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,080
source sources are aligned to GPS traces

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,830
but of course many years have passed and

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,010
thanks to many big companies we now have

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,780
a lot more detailed sources like

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,980
detailed imagery for all the world

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,950
thanks to s3

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,739
my box DigitalGlobe and being of course

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,409
we have street to you thanks not to

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,409
Google but to mapillary

00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:35,480
the open or alternative and we have a

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,459
lot of vector data like building

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,940
footprints for all of the United States

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:45,500
thanks to Microsoft road network for

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:49,280
Netherlands thanks to AMG and a lot of

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,250
local sources for data so there are so

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,260
many sources that you basically can draw

00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:00,829
anywhere on the map but of course these

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,819
sources have issues as well and the main

00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:07,250
issue is that they're not always recent

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:11,150
like this imagery was taken four years

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,129
ago but it doesn't actually say so on

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,950
the imagery itself you have to know

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:22,099
where to look the same for Street View

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:24,950
you may not notice it but still two

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:28,790
images can be taken like two years ago

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:32,299
the same for vector data same for even

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:35,590
GPS traces people are still tracing the

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:40,549
map from traces uploaded ten years ago

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:44,840
so opposite map is considered to be very

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:47,329
recent very quality map but in fact we

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,329
all editors were posted map using

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:54,049
sources that are very old we are making

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:57,230
the map of yesterday figuratively which

00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:01,849
means years for half a year a year ago

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:07,340
and that is the main issue with sources

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:10,400
in OpenStreetMap so a bit about myself I

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,190
work in company called Juna this is taxi

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,379
service like uber but works only in New

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,229
York if you're in New York try using it

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:21,289
it's very generous to drivers and on my

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:26,210
job I work with vast amounts of data

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:29,409
collected from all the rights from all

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,409
parts of infrastructure

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:40,440
for example I work with all right

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,830
data collectors like where people get on

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,130
the car get get dropped off all the time

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,610
stamps locations all the total

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,360
information speeds and so on and of

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:59,450
course a roll a GPX traces from the

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:03,510
rights they look like this

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:06,840
there of course row and in build up

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,060
areas you might know that GPX I see no

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,070
chance to drift off quite a lot

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,220
especially in areas like Manhattan with

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,370
very high buildings so how do you work

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,310
with it how do you analyze it and make

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:24,210
any calculations there is a process for

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,270
that and better may have talked about it

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,190
in his graph for presentation it's

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,280
called map matching you basically take

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:37,200
every point of the trace and find the

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:42,360
road segment that was most likely

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:45,360
traveled and it's not always nearest

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,310
road segment as you can see drift off

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,250
quite significantly

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,350
but using complex processes involving

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,419
Markov chains predictions and stuff like

00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:01,530
that you finally get a road segments

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:04,740
which you can do your work this these

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,450
algorithms are pretty well implemented

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,330
in open source decisions there is very

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,020
serenity which we use I believe graph

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,080
quarter also can do it so now we have

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,730
our signals

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,880
that's theory so when I came to Juna as

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,500
you know I come from a posted map and I

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,040
have been thinking how can I help my

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,919
project what can I do to improve

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,550
opposite map itself working at you know

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,520
I cannot of course publish her GPS

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,680
traces for people to trace because that

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:47,550
will be breach of privacy and

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:49,169
corporate stuff but turns out one of my

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:54,419
colleagues have already started working

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:56,759
on a very interesting theme he basically

00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,930
took all the traces with head for a day

00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:06,030
all 50,000 of them I really hope we will

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:10,590
have some 2,000 a year he matched them

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:14,419
to opposite me abroad network all 50,000

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:20,690
and started looking for animal anomalies

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:23,840
anomalies for unexpected loops for

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:27,810
places where matched roads diverged from

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,300
a rot react because these mean that

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,699
there is an error in opposite map that

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,860
there is some one way road dispenser to

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:44,940
take in correctly that there are some

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:48,599
segments missing and so on and I took

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,150
over the project and made it more

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:58,039
production-ready it looks like this so

00:07:51,150 --> 00:08:02,460
you can see that traces form our taxi

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:06,570
drivers help find quite low issues in

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,659
OpenStreetMap like here redress traces

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,180
of the road race from the car and the

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,150
blue one is matched to OpenStreetMap and

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,639
you can see that there is probably some

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:23,250
small segments in osm that's marked one

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,830
way incorrectly so what I did is

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,310
basically sped it up now it process like

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,400
million of writes in under five hours I

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,500
made a nice user interface so I can

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,909
immediately see errors on the map and

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,270
add fun stuff and it's continued rise so

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:45,089
it runs every day so every morning I

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,020
start with fixing the most prominent

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,310
errors in OpenStreetMap

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:55,040
there are these are other examples of

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:59,750
such errors like some kind of statements

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,390
and stuff so there was around 2% of

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:07,610
Rights meshed incorrectly when I started

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:14,720
now it's like 1 in 200 which is quite

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:16,970
great but not perfect some rights some

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,959
false positives come from for example

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,750
sudden drift of GPS signal which

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,300
obviously cannot mesh to anything or

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,770
when texted drivers make sudden u-turn

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:34,700
to turn left well whereas Forbidden Zone

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:37,130
but mostly is okay well one time I start

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,959
my morning with finding that more than

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,470
hundred rights were matched incorrectly

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,570
in West Manhattan because somebody has

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,690
reversed a couple of streets one way

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,910
streets so I start investigating it

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,700
because you don't just correct it

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:57,829
without understanding what happened so I

00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:00,350
open satellite imagery so Street was

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:03,320
heading that that way and people

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,300
reversed it to face that way and you can

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:13,370
see that cars are stationed in the new

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:15,950
way the waited has been fixed and I open

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,490
Google Street View and again it looks

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:23,420
like it's one way street hit westward so

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:26,420
the Edit must be right but I still have

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,390
hundreds rights they tell otherwise that

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,829
it must be an error and when the street

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,149
was headed eastward it was all okay so

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:39,350
what happened I started googling and

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:41,660
turns out that four month ago the

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,050
Department of Transport indeed reversed

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:49,490
the direction of the street but it was

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,510
just four months ago and all the sources

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:59,060
would have like satellite imagery like

00:10:52,510 --> 00:11:00,170
okay like Street View they don't reflect

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,730
it

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:08,360
because satellite imagery was taken like

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:13,730
half a year ago and street views from

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,680
2017 I wrote about it to osm editor who

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,370
made the change asking them to be more

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,639
careful and from the answer I got two

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,649
things first

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:29,110
well I was answered by lift employee

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:31,519
lift his now taxi service and she

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,120
basically said that she's a part of our

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,329
mapping team and she didn't have enough

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,750
source so which means that leaved

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,699
well as well as super as well as any big

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,829
companies that use geospatial data they

00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:47,839
use all posted map that's for sure we

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:50,060
know that everyone uses opposite map at

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,480
this moment but what's more important

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,649
they have dedicated mapping team a group

00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:01,490
of people who fixes errors on opposite

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:03,370
map which they can find and the second

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,870
thing is they don't have recent sources

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:11,240
working lifts and even bigger company

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:17,269
dollars and that is again the issue with

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:20,000
sources for OpenStreetMap so being a

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:25,279
person involved in the open project I

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,550
started thinking how can I invent how

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,620
can I give more better sources because I

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:38,180
found the error while they didn't so

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:42,730
there is depicts traces we've got every

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:45,730
minute we get like dozen new rights

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:51,260
doesn't you roll GPS traces for the city

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:53,240
but you can share them so how does

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,300
happen no post-it map actually in

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,779
OpenStreetMap nobody downloads GPX files

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,350
anymore well nobody uploads them but

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:06,139
that's another thing because working

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,329
these de peixe is very hard it's a

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:11,240
complex format it takes a lot of memory

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:14,000
and where when there is a lot of Rights

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,300
it's very hard to trace over GPS traces

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,050
so instead people just add the big

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:25,910
styles layer it's all the same traces

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:29,779
but rendered in raster tiles the color

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:33,709
means direction of travel so the blue

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:36,610
one is traveling to the east and red is

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:39,459
to the west so you can immediately see

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:46,610
one-way streets and two-way streets and

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:49,339
where can you go so I looked at the de

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,610
Peixe tile layer for Manhattan and it

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,810
was abysmal it's just a couple Wiggly

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,670
lines in Manhattan where there's a lot

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,550
of people living and working

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,370
so obviously this couldn't be the source

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:09,350
for lift mappers or for any neighbors

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:11,810
well so what I did was took the source

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,430
code that produces this tiles because as

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:19,250
everything else in opposite map it's

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:26,899
open source and applied them to our two

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:29,689
peaks traces yeah that's what I got it's

00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:34,279
a tracer just for one day for the area

00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:36,319
around the street in question and you

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,360
can see that there are some one-way

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:41,509
streets you can learn their direction

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,040
and so on so it's looks pretty useful

00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:49,550
much better than tracing opposite map

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,699
and the important thing is these are not

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:57,680
raw data not depicts traces they have no

00:14:52,699 --> 00:15:01,509
metadata and which means this is

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:08,720
sufficiently anonymized for publishing

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:13,430
so we have now we have daily built

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,949
docker container with tiles for writes

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:20,240
which happened yesterday is just one day

00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:22,480
of travels in the taxi service so this

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,610
contains blue dahlia it's published

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,340
internally at the moment and ready to be

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,950
published elsewhere and

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,000
so what's more important that we've got

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,860
permission to publish it for the public

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,100
there are some develops issues but in a

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,420
week or two it will be accessible to any

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,630
opposite map editor and with that it

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,050
will become the most recent source in

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:56,710
opposite map ever it's only for New York

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:59,740
City we operate only in New York and New

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:06,730
Jersey soon

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:10,230
but even then is basically you can see

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:16,180
where cars drive the day before today

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:18,670
like yesterday we forget so if a road is

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:28,740
closed then you will notice it on this

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:31,930
map the next day so it is very recent so

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,020
you may believe that after publishing

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,460
this will be no more errors in New York

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,680
City of course that's not correct

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,520
because publishing source doesn't mean

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,610
you instantly get a ready-made map if

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,880
that was the case then since we have

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,760
detailed satellite imagery for most of

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,920
the planet we would have the most

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,530
detailed map for the entire planet and

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,380
that is of course not correct there are

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:03,660
still a lot of places which have roads

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:07,590
and buildings but virtually no map data

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:12,490
so how do you make people make mappers

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:15,670
use the source that you give them the

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,230
common answer is you take this big task

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:23,880
and split it in steps

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:29,380
the thing that Quality Assurance tools

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:32,280
usually do they give you a list of

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:38,710
errors and you can fix them one by one

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:40,780
and we have such - Scott map roulette in

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,810
here for example it

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,980
shows you a segment of the street and

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:51,190
ask you ask you to specify how many

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,900
lanes at have as you can see a number of

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,030
lanes from satellite image area so all

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,510
you have to do is open editor enter a

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,210
number and hit upload and then it gives

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,090
you another the next task the next road

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,280
segment and the next one so couple hours

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,990
pass and you have made a substantial

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:15,060
contribution to opposite map so what I

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:18,280
am doing now at my it's my job is

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,760
linking graphically data with WEP relate

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,850
so people in New York or in United

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,050
States in general you can go and fix the

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:35,260
remaining errors in the road network

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:37,450
it's it work it turned out a bit more

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,710
complex than I expected because I had to

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,050
fix map alerts as well

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:47,350
there are pull requests to going but it

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:53,050
will be done I hope in a week or two so

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:56,610
and when I finish it I may explore other

00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,930
ideas because I still have this large

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:04,450
pile of GPX traces which I can analyze

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:08,170
however I want so what else can we get

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,830
from it we can validate fabric

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,600
crucification

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:17,020
like confirm that the road that is very

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:22,390
prominent on the map has indeed a lot of

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,490
rights going over it we can find one-way

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,490
streets that are incorrectly mapped as

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:31,350
two-way because we don't really date for

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:35,170
that currently missing turn restrictions

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:38,050
if you see hundred cars turning right at

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,950
the intersection only right then it's

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:44,170
most likely you kind of turn left there

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,250
and speed limits although I wouldn't

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:51,110
trust taxi drivers to obey speed limits

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:55,340
if you have any other ideas I'm open so

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:59,100
so what is this all about

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,950
when a company preparation just some I

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,440
think you can can believe they will

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,290
follow through they have money the key

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,290
resources they give people that oversee

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,890
the project so they are fine with their

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:17,250
projects but open projects they rely

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,770
only on you which means if you don't

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:24,900
think about your open projects then

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:28,110
nobody will only people in the community

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,540
are responsible for open projects so you

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,790
cannot expect somebody else to do it for

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:37,890
you

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:43,230
like when I left maps me to work on Juna

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:45,390
I expected to stop contributing to

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:50,850
opposite map or not to contribute as

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:52,680
much but even on the new job I always

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,160
remember that I come from OPA statement

00:20:52,680 --> 00:21:00,450
and the needs of my project are still

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,670
not first but second in length and this

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,790
what helped me to find new ways of

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:10,320
helping opposite map so that's also on

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,960
the most of you if you work for a

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,770
company or for government

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,900
see what you can help with opening maybe

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,140
you can help the company open some

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:26,010
source code that not crucial for your

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,740
project or for some geo data because we

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,550
have too few geo data right now to make

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:38,000
a pretty good map and if you don't work

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:41,100
such company then find a friend who does

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,200
so that's all thinking

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,200
[Applause]

00:21:48,390 --> 00:22:08,620
for questions regarding restrictions

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,840
there are so many options you can find

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,910
in the world especially New York like

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,670
turn restrictions that don't work the

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,190
whole day you see on the street feel

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,740
that there is a clear restriction you

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,770
can turn left and in opposite map you

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,890
also can turn left but then you zoom in

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,690
and you see that these restrictions

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,309
restriction applies only for working

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:36,910
hours so you have to fix opposite map to

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:39,130
reflect that so the restriction the

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:43,870
signage in the real world is very

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:46,150
complex so you have to learn the many

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:50,010
interesting ways people an opposite not

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,010
try to reflect that in their taking

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:29,100
well opposite camp indeed did a great

00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,920
thing with improving GPS signal because

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:37,320
when you have only a GPS receiver or

00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:40,410
your phone then the device doesn't have

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,760
much to work with it just have to rely

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:49,830
on signal from satellites and what

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:53,880
opposite can did was to allow to plug

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:59,550
into a car's system to get information

00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:01,980
about its speed and angle the wheels are

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:04,500
turned to improve the GPS signal using

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,980
this information so it's obviously works

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,800
better in areas like Manhattan and when

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,680
something is obstructing satellites but

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,180
of course there is a drawback why people

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,970
are not using it from daily basis

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:23,280
because you have to have a device that

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:26,820
plugs into your car bus and you have to

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,530
pair it with the phone and it in my case

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,130
it didn't work I couldn't just pair it

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:37,680
with the receiver and if everything else

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:39,180
works then again it's a contact the

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,410
phone connects the phone via bluetooth

00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,900
and it was often just drops connection

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:50,210
but if everything else works then US

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:54,090
Open Street cam can help get a better

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,880
signal but I work taxi company and we

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,310
have several thousands drivers and we

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,170
can distribute the same thing here to

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:06,710
them it's it was hard enough to make

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:12,710
them use the single phone system but

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:12,710
giving extra things this just won't work

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,550
right so the question was can I use my

00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:57,050
phone as a dash cam and then use the

00:25:52,550 --> 00:26:00,830
dash cam footage to improve the map yes

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,730
of course but not the way professional

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,930
company is doing it

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:07,460
we have mapillary which is stretched to

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,520
you that you can collect yourself

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:15,320
basically use ur phone as a dash cam and

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:20,860
it will make photos and send them to the

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:24,890
server and then you can use that footage

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:28,760
to manually add things it have seen to

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,610
the map there are ongoing attempts to

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,530
streamline the process like Richard fair

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:41,000
first is working on an editor that

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:44,720
basically gives you a photo from a

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,910
pillory you click on the photo like on

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,520
the shop or on the sign and it

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:53,270
automatically places markers on the map

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,940
and allows you to describe what you have

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:59,540
clicked on but it's still in early

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,270
stages so I expect in a year or two it

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,750
will be easier to process such - commit

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,750
imagery

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:21,490
I have no idea maybe we should look at

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:23,380
opposite candy time but yeah in New York

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,210
we often have to rely on Google Street

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:31,050
View to cross check errors because

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,050
there's very little mobility

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,739
