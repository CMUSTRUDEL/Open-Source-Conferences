Internet has become an integral part of our lives and everything we do online leaves a trail of data. This data is being collected, analyzed, sold and aggregated to cast profiles about us by companies across the globe. 

In the physical world, if a stranger was to follow you everywhere you go, keep a log of who you talk to and meet with, read your mails and then share all this information with others, wouldn’t you be concerned?
But somehow in the digital world we do not seem to worry too much about the same scenarios. 

One of the main reasons for this is lack of awareness about how most Internet companies are making money these days. In fact, as a consequence of the business model of brokering personal data, a surveillance capitalism emerges. 

With the advent of SaaS, website and app owners usually outsource functionality like analytics, recommendations, A/B tests to be managed by third parties, with legitimate business purposes. 

While these use-cases might seem legit, the way data is collected to solve the legit use-cases are bound to harm the user’s privacy. You end up sharing sensitive user data with the companies you may have never heard of. They can not only link the webpages you visit but also have the ability to de-anonymize you by knowing your name, email, address, passport number etc. 

Once this information leaves your machine, it is out of your control. From it, a detailed profile about you is created, which is then available to a whole bunch of parties, which may or may not live to any ethical standards. With accurate enough profiles, companies and data brokers can simulate the behaviors and decision making of the world's population. They don't even need everyone's interactions because they can infer the whole population behavior from just a few examples of each cluster. 

This is why privacy is everyone’s concern so we need to raise awareness:
- The general public needs to know how every move that they make in the online world is being tracked, shared and used.
- Developers need to consider how their users and customers' data deserves to be treated with respect and care, not sold unknowingly to faceless companies. 

But how do you transmit this complex reality to the broader audience outside our community? What data is being shared unconsciously? Who are these data collectors? What is the impact of our blocking mechanisms as users? 

This is precisely the problem both Local Sheriff and Trackula tackle. 

In this joint talk, we will showcase how two groups of people independently built Browser Extensions to answer these questions. 


Local Sheriff - informs the user about which PII is shared, and with which companies?
Trackula  - from a less technical perspective and through a more visual UX focuses on raising awareness to non technical users.

Captions: 
	00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,850
so it's a full room for a first talk

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,850
that's nice

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,800
hello and welcome to the first talk of

00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:27,310
the decentralized dev room just a quick

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,750
reminder please when you leave the room

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,980
keep it clean

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:41,290
you have the trash bag over there

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:43,860
so put your empty bottles and glasses so

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,020
we're gonna start with our first talk so

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,980
please welcome Santiago's Saavedra and

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,800
Kanak Modi for watching them watching us

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,920
we're the extension exposing privacy

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,920
leak

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,379
well first of all thank you all for

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,360
coming here and thank you for having us

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,060
this is the this talk is a bit of an

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,130
experiment that's coming out because

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,880
both the local Sherriff's project and

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,009
trakula

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,759
went to the color for participation of

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,340
this Deb room and we we were asked that

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,330
we merged our talks and make a

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,770
decentralized one

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,450
so in this development it made sense and

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,899
because we were making an effort to

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,250
explain more or less they come with the

00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,210
same problem from two different

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,380
approaches and I hope that the result is

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:45,270
is good for all of you so what's this

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,520
problem about surveillance

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,470
well it's prevalent that in we all know

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,440
that there are lots of trackers on the

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,990
websites that we most likely visit every

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,210
day like for example Google is embedded

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,600
on more than 80 percent of the web pages

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,110
that we visit in Europe from data form

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,970
who tracks me and there's a lot of

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,500
actors in here and a lot of companies

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,300
that are involved in in this issue but

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,610
why why does this happen how does this

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,120
work well one side application

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,950
developers and website owners want to at

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,540
some point outsource some of their non

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,550
core parts of the application or the

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,440
service they're building to other

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,950
companies right for example to build

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,200
analytics a/b testing recommendations

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,330
advertising some of these use cases are

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,700
legitimate use cases for for businesses

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,319
to to have and they are based on the

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,300
capitalistic model that we are all

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,010
familiar with that website owners pay

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,069
these third parties to provide them with

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,140
services but some others in fact instead

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,209
of doing that they use business models

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,220
made out of the surveillance capitalism

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,590
they made money out of you instead of

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,200
the website owner and in fact the owners

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,230
may even receive part of the revenue how

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,730
does this work well every time you visit

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,170
web page should you interact with a

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,790
digital object that's connected to the

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,610
Internet you generate a trail of data

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,920
and that trail of data is then

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,390
aggregated and brokered by these third

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,620
parties in a data market where it's then

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,840
grabbed by other actors who can

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,810
aggregate them and cast profiles of you

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,610
I'm from that profile then you can get

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,050
behavior analysis of the people and that

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,480
behavior analysis feeds back into the

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,030
system and at some point profiles are so

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,830
good about you that you can predict

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,780
what's what will happen to a crowd of

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,760
people and with that when that happens

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,210
you may be able to predict real-life

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,560
results like the results of an election

00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:44,910
so we think that this is a very

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,430
interesting problem to tackle and that

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,350
we have to do it in a holistic approach

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,720
for example this is one of the

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,970
challenges that we're going to just

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,800
explain imagine you are planning the

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,210
your next trip for example you want to

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,880
go to free software meeting you may have

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,390
come by train or by plane somehow you

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,070
have a booking ID that is fed back to

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,780
you when you pay for your ticket and

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,690
from that booking ID you may be able to

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,640
then get into the reservation to maybe

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,260
add your passport details or your full

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,510
name or something like that and in that

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,090
page there may be some trackers embedded

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,800
and some pixels that allow third parties

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,290
to know that you visited the booking

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,770
page in time and and so on but thing is

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,780
that in many cases these pages include

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,880
the authentication token or include some

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,160
details that can lead back to these

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,720
trackers being able to also see your

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,580
personal information including your full

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,250
name your passport information your home

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,460
address and so on and this is exactly

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,590
the issue that local sheriff focuses on

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,720
in distance playing and I'm telling you

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,660
about so I will now give the stage to

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,660
Connor to talk more about decision

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,339
so before getting into what local

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,990
sheriff actually tries to solve and how

00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,969
it tries to solve let's try and

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,639
understand the example that Santiago

00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:11,009
shared so basically the URL structures

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,009
can have some private information in the

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,990
URL as query parameters or the URL might

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,699
have some authentication tokens which

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,639
leads you to a page which has private

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,740
details we name these types of leaks as

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,149
telltale URLs because these URLs are now

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,229
also being shared with a lot of third

00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:30,149
parties like one example is let's say if

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,999
you are if you ever donated to Mozilla

00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,129
after you finished your payments you get

00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,839
redirected to a thank-you page now all

00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,759
the information that you entered while

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,279
doing the payment your email address

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,159
currency country you belong to amount

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,249
you for transferred it gets added to the

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,990
URL itself and because this page loads a

00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,300
third party in this case from Fahnestock

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,009
google api is calm and the URL is not

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,699
cleaned the same information in this

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:58,019
case is being sent to Google APs com and

00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,459
that's not the only third party that is

00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:00,959
present on this page there are about

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,029
seven third party domains which are

00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,860
present on this page most of them legit

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,449
maybe not legit and we really do not

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,309
know what happens once the URL leaves

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,199
the users machine what we know so far is

00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:13,769
that this information is being sent to

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,300
various third parties another example

00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:17,159
for example this is a very popular site

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,229
called train line go to you which helps

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:21,149
you book train tickets now what happens

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,919
is after you finish the booking you get

00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,979
a URL which has an authentication token

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,479
the URL itself is clean but if you have

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,909
access to this URL you can potentially

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,490
access the users booking delete it

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,079
cancel it change some data and do all

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,949
sort of things that a legit user would

00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,349
be doing all its booking now this same

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,329
concern it also has a lot of third

00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:44,579
parties in this case it's Facebook first

00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:46,589
the leak happens to the referrer second

00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,389
the Facebook the Google Analytics script

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,610
on this page actually reads the URL

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,749
itself does not clean it and sends it

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,639
back home and it's not just Facebook and

00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,899
Google there are about 17 third-party

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,939
domains that belong to five different

00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,349
companies on this page itself so you're

00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,419
booking details which were supposed to

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:05,300
be only your's are now with 17 different

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:07,889
companies that you did not even realize

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,300
that's again an example of flix bus

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,710
doing the same thing they have a auth

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,110
token the URL which is now

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,390
being leaked to phones but Google API is

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,680
calm then this is the case of Lufthansa

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,690
for example if you're traveling

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,950
international you are required to put in

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,840
your passport information during the

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,030
check-in process the Lufthansa was not

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,320
cleaning the URL which basically was

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,600
being shared with a lot of third parties

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,940
giving access to the users passport

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,470
information date of birth etc

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,570
furthermore someone else could also

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,860
actually upload some fake passport and

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,310
when I'm traveling at the airport maybe

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,980
I get caught in some bureaucratic things

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,080
and again there are about four third

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,150
party domains on present on this website

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,780
who get the exact URL which will lead

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,010
them to my booking and passport details

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,680
Spotify is another example if you view

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,780
Spotify desktop app last year and until

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,520
March so if you log in on Spotify

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,560
desktop app and then you click my

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,410
account in the desktop app it would open

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,940
a URL in your default browser now you

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,770
will not need to log in again in your

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,720
default browser because the URL carries

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,880
an OAuth token which leads you to your

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,940
profile details what was happening in

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,740
this case was they had some trackers on

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,450
this page and were not cleaning the URL

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,040
so basically all those tractors were

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,870
getting this earth token which

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,730
potentially gave them partial access to

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,140
your booking the details we are talking

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,640
about here are your date of birth are

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,900
you paid customer if you are a paid

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,670
customer what are the last four digits

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,430
of your credit card number which company

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,840
your credit card belongs to right and

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,370
they were about 25 of these trackers

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,920
present on that page which were getting

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,180
the same details

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,220
similarly if you've ever ordered food

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,440
online a lot of these services I'm going

00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,870
to talk about food water Dodi here so

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,550
the prerequisite of getting home

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,180
delivery is you need to enter your

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,250
address

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,930
now some websites do a reverse geocode

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,760
on the address in to find latitude

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,710
longitude values and then they put that

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,810
information in the URL bar itself and

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,340
because the URLs are not cleaned they

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,860
are now being shared with a lot of third

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,660
parties in this case my home address is

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,840
being shared with 18 third party domains

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,730
when I am ordering food online and I can

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,900
go on and on and on about these examples

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,050
but that's not what I'm going to talk

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,510
about today in a gist there are a lot of

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,620
these URLs being shared every now and

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,290
then when you're transacting on the

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,420
internet it is not just about you being

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,400
tracked across multiple domains it is

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,220
also about websites giving their

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,480
customer data to third parties when it

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,910
is not needed in the first

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,540
and also giving them potential access to

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,170
critical data more worrying is that

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,030
users consent is never there we did one

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,070
test on a website which was leaking such

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,630
telltale URL to some companies we

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,940
actually found their privacy policy is

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,680
pretty outdated and the host names that

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,760
are actually sending data are way more

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,070
as listed on their website to make

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,480
matters worse the websites themselves do

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,280
not realize that they are sharing these

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,100
URLs with these third parties for

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,860
example this is a case from Emirates com

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,750
their privacy policy states that at any

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,400
given point of time you are not supposed

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,770
to share your booking reference and

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,630
lastname with anyone else because they

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,000
can access your booking but at the same

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,100
time Emirates comm was actually leaking

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,170
these same two values to 12 different

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,900
third parties now here's the missing

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,670
piece this looks scary it is a serious

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,010
problem and it is happening everywhere

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,320
but somehow this topic is not being

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,210
talked about and if I tell you the

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,940
horror stories that I have when I am

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,100
reporting these issues it's hilarious we

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,320
can talk about them maybe offline but

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,820
the point here is we believe that there

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
is an important aspect missing here

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,660
which is the tooling right now if we

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,280
have to inspect your own traffic and see

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,590
if these leaks are happening for your

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,000
URLs it's very difficult you need to

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,890
know some network monitoring tool like

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,930
MIT and proxy or need to know dev tools

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,430
you need to understand how first party

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,380
third parties work and what data is

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,000
being leased leaked and you have to do a

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,650
lot of manual steps to actually figure

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,080
out what is happening in your browser

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,290
right and this is the problem you want

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,610
to solve so we took four key details

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,230
that we wanted to solve with local

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,270
sheriff first it should be easy to

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,890
install so you do not really have to be

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,660
a technical user to install the software

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,330
so we thought let's create a browser

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,610
extension because then it will hit the

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,710
masses second it should be able to

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,080
monitor all the network traffic between

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,930
a webpage and all the third parties that

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,300
are there on the webpage then all this

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,280
data needs to remain on the user's

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,050
machine at any given point of time the

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,670
software local sheriff or any other

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,990
software is not allowed to send anything

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,020
back home because it's critical data

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,420
itself then the users can actually

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,649
understand if it's a first party for

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,290
example I visited a page

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,660
it's a call that got loaded on the first

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,399
party itself and after all this data is

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,319
collected locally on your machine you

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,879
also get a search interface on the

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,860
extension itself which helps you now

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,629
find out what is happening and what

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,629
private data of yours has been leaked to

00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,730
which companies as an example

00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,740
once you install local sheriff this icon

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,269
appears in your toolbar and it starts to

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,300
monitor the web request using the web

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,850
request API from browser extensions then

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,829
when the you when local sheriff gets a

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,449
request it classifies whether this is a

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:11,550
first party request for example in this

00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:13,350
case it will classify oh it's edition

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,809
not cnn.com so this is what the user

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,119
visited and all these different calls

00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:20,119
are actually what is happening as third

00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:23,129
party calls on that particular webpage

00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:25,769
then additionally we also want to map if

00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,600
a particular domain is known to belong

00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,429
to a certain company for example if you

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,709
load cnn.com and there is a call to

00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,600
maximize a lot net we want to tell the

00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,970
user that maximize a dotnet actually

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,610
belongs to Oracle so we also want to get

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,389
the parent company to create a detailed

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,009
introspection on who is actually

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,480
collecting your debt on the web so for

00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,670
this we use an open source database

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,379
available from who tracks what me we

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,879
ship it locally on the client side with

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,939
the extension itself which contains this

00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,350
mapping and then finally this is the

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,449
interface that local sheriff would have

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,490
first of all on the top you would see

00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,439
have any of data points entered in forms

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,480
been shared so basically we assume that

00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,759
details being entered in the forms are

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,519
critical at the first place so it

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,259
automatically Flags if you entered a

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,480
value in the form and that has been seen

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,920
being sent to any third party so here it

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,050
will list down the value you entered in

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,939
the form and label it as yes or no and

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,399
if you click on the yes it will then

00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:19,199
give you a detailed log as a second step

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,610
let's take an example again as the

00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,019
second step let's say after installing

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,660
local sheriff I went to this whole

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,939
process of donating to Mozilla again now

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,649
what will happen is I go to the search

00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,299
interface and I enter my email address

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,730
to see has this email address been

00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,379
shared with any third parties now as you

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,329
start typing in the search bar it will

00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,980
list down that yes this email address

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,869
has been shared to seven third party

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,699
domains who are owned by two different

00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:43,259
companies by one website in this case

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,730
this is the website then you can also

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,350
take a look at the detailed logs saying

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,720
how this actually got leaked was it

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,249
referrer headers was it in the payload

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,920
itself which is being sent to analytics

00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:53,769
companies and

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,420
like these if you want to do more

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,029
advanced analysis let's say I do not

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,250
want to share a private information that

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,320
has been leaked rather I want to see how

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,600
much information does Facebook has on me

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,240
in my browser so what I do is I actually

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,430
start off fresh profile on browser I

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,990
visit few web sites then I look for this

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,300
pattern which is basically used by

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,160
Facebook to track or send data to its

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,860
analytic services so when I search for

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,070
facebook.com slash PR it lists down that

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,560
there are four websites that have a

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,540
Facebook cracker and also Facebook puts

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,370
a cookie in this case it starts from fr

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,930
is equal to some value which is being

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,389
set on my machine and sent back home

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,279
with all these information then I say

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,470
okay let me take this cookie value and

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,029
then see how many websites are being

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,570
tracked by Facebook and the list

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,860
explodes to allow 11 websites now now if

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,350
you take a look at this example that I

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,839
shared before train line dot u which has

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,550
potential access to anyone who has this

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,500
URL about my personal details my full

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,829
name my email address it has a Facebook

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,570
tracker

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:56,199
which also has the same cookie and

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,699
sending this URL back home coming back

00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:59,890
to the fedora example which is sending

00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,990
my lat/long values back home to Facebook

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,640
with the same cookie which is actually

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,190
if you put it on maps you can see the

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,500
exact house where it was ordered is also

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,300
being sent back and now if you look at

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,040
this this is like an analytics back-end

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,199
of any tracker that would be you have

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,269
these four URLs along with that cookie

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,709
which is enough to say that this same

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,810
user is going through all these

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,560
different domains but also thanks to

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,089
last two URLs now if this tracker wants

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,589
to do naanum ëismí on the internet it's

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,910
very easy for them because now they can

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,230
say oh by the way this train line

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,390
booking belongs to this such and such

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,649
person and this such and such person has

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,240
a probability of living at this address

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,740
local sheriff can not only be used by

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,240
users but also can be used by

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,399
organizations and developers to test

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,110
their own apps before the leaks hit the

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,490
production systems they can include

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,529
local sheriff in their testing

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,970
frameworks and start testing for privacy

00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,000
leaks and audit their applications

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,620
themselves it's available or not all

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,029
platforms because it's in blab extension

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,010
so you can basically install it from

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,899
Firefox tor or chrome store and test

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,290
your favorite websites or when you are

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:04,510
checking your flights or trains back

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,870
while going from Boston

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:10,120
make sure to see how it's getting leaved

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,890
last this local sheriff tool helps

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,600
people who already are aware of online

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,550
tracking world and want to see the next

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,020
step of what data is being leaked but

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,330
there is a there is still a huge gap

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,460
between understanding what is happening

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,200
in the online tracking landscape and

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,000
this is where the project from Sophia

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,070
and Santiago comes in which is Dracula

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:37,360
so I'll like to hand back Mike to

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:40,180
Santiago to explain Dracula more so our

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,460
idea is how to if the other challenge is

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,020
how to make this approachable to

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,370
everybody out there outside this

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,910
neighbor room and outside of Austin and

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,440
outside you know this technical context

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,550
that you need to be aware of to

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:58,650
understand these issues and that's where

00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:03,209
the product comes in we started out in

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:08,530
in a citizen laboratory in Madrid where

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:11,440
where we there was an open call for

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,160
participation that was more geared

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,730
towards maybe journalists and artists

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,530
about migrations and we came up with an

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,610
idea of migrations of data through the

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,720
digital world and we were chosen to to

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,910
pitch this idea to a group of

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:33,100
collaborators that ended up being on the

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,900
project and after we came up to tell

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,640
them about and the whole whole idea of

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,210
how the technology is tracking you

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,430
through all these means they wanted to

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,220
be able to explain that to the friends

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,590
and how could they appeal to the broader

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,840
public so we want to empower them to be

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,840
able to do just that and so that then

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,060
other extensions such as maybe a local

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,720
sheriff or you block or something that

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:02,230
really helps you protect from that can

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,030
happen and can go more Broadway more to

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:10,300
the broader sense so after being able to

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:12,910
go from this state of things where we

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,559
have one we're on the technical side

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,840
it's sometimes difficult to

00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,639
get down to just the simplified point of

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,289
how to use things we have all the

00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:24,440
technology involved and when you finally

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:25,759
get that and everything everyone is on

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,710
the same table and is able to understand

00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:33,139
that it's better to be able to took a

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:37,549
daily around so we we started out with

00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:40,460
the with Mozilla I dream as an example

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,779
of the idea that we wanted to convey

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,169
this was one of the tools that we used

00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:49,279
to make them try to make them understand

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:53,450
the problem but they felt that this this

00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:56,119
kind of visualization gave you too much

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,740
information at once for what for the

00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,279
basic idea of what they're trying to

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,710
solve so we want we worked with that and

00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,230
we we have a workers web extension that

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,159
is a fork of light beam that works with

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,320
another visualization set the idea being

00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,389
having a metaphor about the real world

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,789
about the world that you know and the

00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:18,740
underworld where everything is happening

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:23,090
but it's not just as easy to be aware of

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,340
it so we first tried with trees that you

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,409
plant or the websites that you are

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,230
visiting and then the roots underneath

00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:32,990
are the points where the data's being

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:36,919
shared but someone told us and it's true

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,679
that trees don't share roots in the

00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,629
bottom so we changed the realm to the

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,590
fungi the fungi realm because mycelium

00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:48,350
is really the thing where different

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,200
fungi in in the upper world share their

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,139
roots in the underworld and from that

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,909
the deeper you go down the more the

00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,929
darker it gets in the background and the

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:02,749
more rooted the trackers are on the

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:06,649
websites that you are visiting so this

00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:09,950
is the plugin working and it has some

00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:11,749
sort of information in general about the

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,330
visualization that you're doing but also

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:17,480
on the left there are some information

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,159
pills of ideas about tracking in general

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,009
and also the most prevalent trackers

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,019
that you have and as you see what I was

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:26,299
saying the more into the bottom that you

00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,740
go the more route that they are on all

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,780
the websites that you visit and you

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,190
always keep track

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,020
of the last five websites that you're

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,560
visiting so that not too much

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,490
information is crowded on the on the

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,330
page at once

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:42,540
and also this visual resume is unique to

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:46,080
every user in a given point in time and

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,180
if you install some extensions or

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,710
utilities to block information to work

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,790
sorry to bug connections to the outside

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,260
world then you will find this

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,990
visualization change so that you don't

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,030
get as deeply rooted connections because

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,800
all these trackers will you will no

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:10,480
longer connect to them sorry I have

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:14,470
problem passing the slide sorry about

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,040
that there is so at some point you will

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,680
have a more clear ground of what's

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,110
happening and you will not find these

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,150
connections that I was saying but now

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:29,080
how can we appeal to the greater

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:33,850
audience in one side I think we all must

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,640
get built technology that allows us to

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,000
communicate all these issues clearly

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:46,600
with everyone else so that you do not

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,940
need to have as technical background as

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,480
you would if you just try to convey the

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,180
most information possible so we were

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,100
talking yesterday in at dinner how we

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,570
could communicate and collaborate with

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:04,650
our joint work to appeal to a more

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:08,620
better audience greater audience and

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:12,090
local sheriff has an idea of notifying

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:15,750
the user from automatically from the

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:18,220
form data that is being leaked and

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,500
turning it into some kind of privacy

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,380
analysis engine so that other other

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,850
tools can use local sheriff data as as

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,010
as an engine for all these things and

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,230
the ideas that Chocula becomes some sort

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,020
of UI for local sheriff so that we can

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,210
on one side have the technology and the

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,830
other side have the visualization and we

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,640
want to share that for JTP our

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,830
compliance

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,390
and this is our first start for them so

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,679
it's really nice if you gave us feedback

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,630
thank you very much

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,810
Thank You Sophia for all the graphics

00:22:46,630 --> 00:23:01,719
that

00:22:46,810 --> 00:23:01,719
[Applause]

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:11,040
so is there any question the additional

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:20,160
Nexo dues on a cell phone a plane okay

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:24,060
so questions to questions if you don't

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,310
mind one is as I understand when data

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:30,450
doesn't leak you're like it doesn't

00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:32,490
leave your computer or handheld you

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,530
cannot actually connect something what

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,050
was happening on your laptop and your

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,780
mobile device so is it in your roadmap

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,880
to safely share and collect all your

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,130
activities from different devices in one

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,180
place no and otherwise it all together

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,250
and another question is related to add

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:55,050
blockers so across that semester extent

00:23:50,250 --> 00:24:00,720
can block some trackers how these works

00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:03,630
with local sharif like would it show you

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,810
that some parts of requests were blocked

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,900
and you was protected partially thank

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,900
you

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,149
[Music]

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:30,869
[Music]

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,530
yeah sorry about that so to answer your

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,380
first question right now because it's

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,000
just a web extension so it's not yet

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,220
possible to analyze or even analyze

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,470
mobile apps but that's something which

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,090
is on the roadmap to maybe build

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,220
something equivalent of local sheriff to

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,780
also analyze mobile apps and then maybe

00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,720
think about connecting it as a complete

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:14,830
profile on the second question about the

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:17,380
ad blockers so maybe you can so about

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,180
the second question what's the

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,150
possibility of leaks if you're using

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,680
some ad blockers I would say yes there

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,400
is still a possibility because there are

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,530
so many different ways such sensitive

00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,630
data can be sent outside and had

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,390
blockers will not block everything that

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,980
is being sent so it is likely that you

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,220
will still leak some information because

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,510
they are basically based on host names

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,390
blocking and things like these so it's

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,820
not the perfect match to block certain

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,540
things at some point website owners and

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,150
third-party

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,920
tool developers need to own this and fix

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,020
these mistakes themselves but we can

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,230
talk about it more in detail offline

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,230
maybe

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:17,160
hi guys thanks for being here I have a

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:20,040
very simple question you're saying that

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,500
one of your huge cases is to train the

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,610
users train them to understand what

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,800
privacy is and how to make sure that

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,500
their privacy is being violated

00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,540
step-by-step do you think that it's easy

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,650
to present that to my mother or to my

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,990
grandmother that sees using simply

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,380
Facebook to check out and the familiars

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:46,559
or for example why should I use

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:51,230
trakula instead of the EF FS privacy

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,230
butter for example thank you

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,299
[Music]

00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:29,369
personally I was trying to explain this

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:35,330
this problem to my mother and I used the

00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:40,229
Chocula and she understood so I think

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:45,690
the advert user is going to understand

00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:47,580
it with this and the idea was that we

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,350
also tested this with the other groups

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,129
that were on the open call so they were

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,769
our beta testers so to say so of course

00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,299
this could this can be improved and we

00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,859
hope to get more collaborators and more

00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,960
people involved and have more projects

00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:02,580
like like this happen with non-technical

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,940
people so that they can better

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,979
understand it and empower them to build

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,899
upon this and make better tooling for it

00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,899
and what was the other question

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,539
okay so what's the benefit to your

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,029
mother if she knows what is happening in

00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:26,490
indistinct well she can then install

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:28,350
other extensions or other things to be

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,850
aware of it and block if it she that she

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,679
wants to and in any way have the

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,380
conscious decision of whether she wants

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,710
to share that data or not thank you very

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,480
much

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:47,299
do we have no time for no questions

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,299
