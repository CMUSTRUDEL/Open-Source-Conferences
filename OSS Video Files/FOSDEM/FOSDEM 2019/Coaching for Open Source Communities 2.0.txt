very good thank you

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,040
[Applause]

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,100
so I love to start with this image about

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,560
this topic and probably the first things

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,900
that you see that I love action movies

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,390
okay but it's important for me this

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:37,390
picture for lot of reason different and

00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:39,690
now we will see why in few okay okay no

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,690
problem

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,710
okay

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,579
so no one knows so this movie in demand

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:52,600
time only me know I think there is our

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,770
there is someone else okay okay it's not

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,969
a problem for the talk

00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,969
okay if you didn't see the movie

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,020
I can go

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,040
okay important that there is there is

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,250
according so okay so let's back okay

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,830
so thinking a moment of the mage let's

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,830
start talking about why the Expendables

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,990
movies as a cover of this talk

00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,690
the first point is that not because of

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,220
the movie name because can be strange

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,340
but for the people in the picture

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,380
because we have examples of different

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,190
kind of people working together in a

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,970
single photo we have everyone that has a

00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:03,300
specific role and specific tools for

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,300
this job and that so everyone is easy to

00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,149
recognize for his role in that so

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,140
everyone doesn't have problems new in

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:16,620
their task doesn't we can say doesn't

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,770
have problems they trust each other's so

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,810
this is important in a team the boss is

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,110
a leader in the group is someone of the

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,150
group not outside the group and the

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,739
place debt as open source we are not

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,900
soldiers but we are volunteers and this

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,350
is the power what we can learn from this

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,750
photo but let's talk about me I am

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,600
Daniela scafati from Italy we have a web

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,459
agency I work as developer so I don't

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,800
doing community management for living

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,920
and I started doing committee management

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,470
because I start a project and in Italy I

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,600
saw the community has problems so I

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,380
stopped Edina say ok we need to fix it

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,930
so during the time I started the six

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,480
years ago we don't Zillah and with

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,940
Godzilla Tahlia later with the mozilla

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,550
rest program that is empowering all the

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,370
community of mozilla in the world doing

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,019
activities whatever they need now I'm

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,330
part of the councii that is elected

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,000
every year this for the second term and

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,530
that's a Mozilla tech speaker so I am

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,530
part of the Mozilla community for

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,880
different kind of things and also part

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,780
of the multilateral community of course

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,810
lots of WordPress later and for the

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,180
warpath italia one and also as localizer

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,490
a boobers and that's a core contributor

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,740
and helping organizing few meet ups in

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,360
italy but that's a part of another

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,870
project this is a fork of wordpress is

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,849
gossip

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,739
and that's a part of the founding

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,379
committee and that's a part of the

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,510
international team I'm president of an

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,830
Italian Association of Professional that

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,599
worked with open source just to

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,269
understand my background I am a

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,040
developer so when I started I say okay

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,769
I'm doing committee management but

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,209
really I have to read the books about

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,730
psychology team management I am a

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,470
developer let me know what I have to do

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,720
I will do it for me is a ticket is

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,159
perfect because I know what to do so why

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,290
I have to do these kind of things so

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,709
let's start talking about what is

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,229
coaching coaching usually I was thinking

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,680
it was this look in the movie the coach

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:27,000
of the football team so what I need in a

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,600
community coaching also thinking maybe

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,910
is a teacher like at school but after

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,139
learning a little bit wasn't both of

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,300
them we have to think that we are game

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,060
not soldiers that they receive orders

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,800
but we are people that understand other

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,940
people because we are volunteers we are

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,010
part of the same team so I like a lot

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,370
the comic strip and I was thinking that

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,349
so coaching is also doing mentor because

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,780
I think I'm SME a good mentor helping

00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:00,960
people join activities doing helping to

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,630
introduce them but mentor is not only

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
part of coaching because we have a good

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,010
way in a comic about what means to be a

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,580
mentor is not okay this is the right way

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,370
to do it

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,990
let me explain know let people to do it

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,960
that way so they will be motivated

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:20,370
understand why there is a problem and my

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,130
way was thinking is a problem of

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,530
communications because you know it is

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,380
famous Italian gesturing a lot and we

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,150
didn't see that but and most in the

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,440
communication but the point is that

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,330
there are different way of

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,940
communications Italian communicate with

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,160
words with voice but that's with the

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,150
gestures so it's not like a specific

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,820
like right in the forum but there are so

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,160
different kind of Italians too so there

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,469
are two kind of people too in that

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,840
picture of different kind of food in

00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,310
Italy just understand that is not only a

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,550
problem of communications

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,160
is not probably of food or whatever

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,960
communication is not only say to people

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,770
staff but that so is a mix of a lot of

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,430
things speech again food science diving

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,990
weather is a mix of things communication

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,480
so when I started looking ok what I can

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,389
find of motivational image for coaching

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,700
I found a lot of image with a lot of

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:22,080
thought interestings allow about

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,760
leadership and that is a big part of the

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,760
pads all about what is coaching because

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,010
coaching born in Enterprises company so

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,919
what why with open source community what

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,870
we have in common we are part of a team

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,090
the purpose is completely different we

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,080
like the project because we give our

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,060
time our passion fan whatever to start

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,950
work in a project we are not getting

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,130
money to work in a project because we'd

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,490
like to work in this project so coaching

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,830
this is the right definition coaching is

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,400
releasing a person's potential to the

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,040
maximum and is helping them to learn

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,290
rather teaching them so they will

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,220
discover on their own but we are only

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,650
putting them in the right way and this

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,539
is a complete picture of the various

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,110
part of the pads or what is coaching we

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,760
have motivate inspire mentoring lead

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,220
back sample this is very important

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,350
because the people see you as part of

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,720
the team so they take you as a reference

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,720
in a community teamwork

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,080
vision these this is coaching in a

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,580
picture but for me wasn't enough because

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,070
we are talking about volunteering again

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,900
I am a developer I am doing volunteering

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,180
and helping on committee management as I

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,550
think there is people like me or that so

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,430
of other bed they were working

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,890
background doing community management so

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,900
I started looking again on internet

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,410
about motivational image about

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,780
volunteering and we can see that the

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,880
many focus point that we are there

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:59,789
because we wanted so we need to be a

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:04,770
nice way to gratification a lot of

00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:06,840
things so let's move again back to what

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,169
is coaching because right now I never

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,020
see

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,919
anything about it this is my single

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,990
slide recap about what is coaching

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,460
coaching is not only to help others but

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,650
that's all you this is very important

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:24,840
because you can use this method add some

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,969
problem yourself its focus on skills not

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,150
to the person's this is very important

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,150
okay

00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:57,220
it's also okay learn to delegate Oh

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,060
one two three okay

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,769
it's learn to delegate and trust the

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,309
people around you you're a part of a

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,769
team and a team works by good when

00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,839
everyone trusts each others and when it

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:17,689
is possible to communicate each other's

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:21,079
so also delegate it's a very huge part

00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:23,509
on coaching because everyone is here for

00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,480
a reason so everyone has to do some

00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:28,790
things start with this point and also

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,370
talk to people with motivation in mind

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,649
we are here and we need to be motivated

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,680
because again we are volunteers we are

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,959
not getting money to be here so they can

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,470
be a motivation of course so there are

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,350
they'll chop some guide or excite people

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,689
led to people to talk and ask for help

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:51,079
I thought it is very important a lot of

00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:53,540
people like to be part of something just

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:58,069
because they can say something that's oh

00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:01,579
thanks can be a way for them guide don't

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:04,069
judge quite simple great confidence in

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:06,290
Italy this is a very important but I can

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:08,660
say that is important we were when there

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:12,129
is confidence in a team there will be

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,930
very easy to work and move on rings and

00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:18,430
the grow model is part of the coaching

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:21,290
is four points goal what is your goal

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,110
reality the actual situation with bed

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:29,180
and goon Fox reality they find few

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,970
solutions and wrap up as developer for

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,120
me the best recap is that they find the

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,209
problem what we want to achieve propose

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,429
few options and recap and create a plan

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,730
this is nice easy way to remember all of

00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:46,399
these kind of things so this is open

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,319
source in action this is a modular land

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,889
four years ago and we have a group of

00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:53,959
different people we have a model

00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:58,939
employee we are volunteers we have

00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:01,189
designer developers and teachers we have

00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:04,100
a group of people there with a lot of

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:05,030
post-it in a wall very a lot that they

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,570
share their feet

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,220
ideas everything all together and

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,000
leaving feedback each others in an open

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,620
way and approaching as us in this case

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,050
that I remember and now a single problem

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,790
as example so a group of people with

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:24,350
different backgrounds for the same

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:27,050
reason so but we are only started the

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,510
talk and again as Italian there is

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,270
always something a next about food when

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,250
you're doing a meal so let's start

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,860
because we are a little bit fatter and

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,230
now I want to explain a simple way to

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,850
understand the coaching way in the case

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,060
of Italian I know there is a lot of

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,340
Italian dislike but it's part ok this is

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,900
Tim working in this case this is my

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:53,630
house in the countryside of machinery

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,490
there is my father and two friends they

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,380
are doing I think that everyone knows I

00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,750
think this is not a puppet explain there

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,420
are doing pizza and everyone has a

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,390
specific role again everyone doing

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,720
something in a chain and everyone looks

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,600
what is doing the others in this case

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,610
when I prepare the pasta the pizza I put

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,740
the ingredients and put in the horror

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,750
and mckay's we have someone that is a

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,660
leader in this case is my father I am

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,310
doing the beta testing that 5 phase only

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,400
organize the event but this part of the

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,730
team at Siddis so this is an example of

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,589
teamwork quite easy to understand the

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,050
next point of the teamwork is enjoyed

00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:36,110
the results because we have these pizza

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,920
everyone is here you see what everyone

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,260
do it the next point is enjoy together

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,420
what they did because the team working

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,770
we are volunteers again we are doing

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,050
because we want to enjoy what we are

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,530
doing so everyone there is enjoying

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,570
after now it's night after the day did

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,160
the work we have for who is asking

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,050
because people often ask me this is

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,170
about the man Erwin why red wine just

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,270
who is asking in case this is people

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,760
that is it join together after the day

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,160
doing the pizza because is when you're

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,700
doing for five hours is a very big very

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,130
hard

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:14,200
so the understand this is team working

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:17,180
in a coaching way or together so again

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,339
with the pizza when this we understood

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,410
what is to

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,809
working what means enjoy the results and

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,370
do it together so let's start about

00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:31,059
talking about why we are doing better in

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:34,899
coaching provinces community we have

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,540
everyone's that works together you are

00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,430
not an usual member of the community but

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,829
the veteran left community I saw this

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,839
term start jumping in a lot of community

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,550
the veteran someone that is like you but

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
has more experience than you in the

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,529
project so people see you as a reference

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,059
when you have asking something because

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,370
they have no idea were to find some

00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:58,230
things what is the right process this

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,999
you like the veteran of the community

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,649
you know your community status and the

00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,480
people of the community because we are

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:08,110
leading that so this is part of the set

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,300
these two points and that so is part for

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,970
coaching they find the best way for the

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:17,019
members of the community how to do a

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,779
community budget of the members find

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,850
Pro+ people during the activities I saw

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,399
that is very important to embodying

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,829
people and get their engagement quite

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,709
easily because when you find a proposal

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:31,480
if people and let you them to join some

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,899
things that will lead something else

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,809
later in few months probably yeah I saw

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,290
a lot of cases in different community it

00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:43,600
is one of the most important points ask

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,759
them to enjoy discussion is one of the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,399
first example that I give to people when

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,959
you find someone propose ative just let

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,879
them to join a discussion later maybe

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,149
another meeting may be another thread

00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,809
whatever because unit people need an

00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,519
input we are people we need the pink and

00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:03,309
of course be transparent about decisions

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,129
this is very important and not forget to

00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:07,540
say thank you people does often forget

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,829
to say thank you but is always very

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,579
important because again we are

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:17,019
volunteering so and you are volunteer

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:18,819
like others we are not something in hop

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,300
from them but we are like part of the

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:24,040
rest of the team one of the tips that I

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,230
saw that is very important to let people

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,259
to join discussion is organize a

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,340
schedule before the meeting and share it

00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,380
like one day before one week in a way

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,240
what can check okay then we discard this

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,670
kind of things so maybe if Fermi is

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,770
important to join maybe I can have ready

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,170
the question I can put in the docs maybe

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:45,070
they will reply to what I need so people

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,810
in that wave feed more part of the team

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,670
prepare activities with examples and

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,310
documentation is one of the way people

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,800
love to organize things when they have

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,900
the chance to do it so I usually do for

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,810
my work for the community to create

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,360
examples of activity they have to do I

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,580
don't know review a document create the

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,410
strata from work flow as an example is a

00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,630
way for them to be part of the community

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,290
doing something like a tutorial they can

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,450
be used from someone else great roots

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,610
policies a workflow with the community

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,560
as again with the Mozilla telecommuting

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,320
we started discussing now we have a

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,390
manual of 40 pages for how to localize a

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,820
modular project as an example people

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,220
started and now people that statical

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,010
live in feedback now is reviewer of the

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,190
localization team started outside the

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:37,880
team later localizer now is part of the

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,860
localization team as reviewer in that so

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,540
present social networks now is important

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,530
which the new people new offenses in

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,750
enthusiasts that doesn't know how works

00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:51,260
open source and we need to use social

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,540
networks in that so this is very

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,510
important ask always for feedback

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,730
because people love to leave their tags

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,770
feedbacks whatever so it's very

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,270
important leave the floor to that

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,830
because people when they see they can

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,840
leave feedbacks because everything is

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,760
transparent want to keep doing and

00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,220
leather probably they will start drawing

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,930
discussions meetings whatever so we will

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,860
find an important part of your community

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,590
without controlling that so however all

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,230
my work for you this is a youth list but

00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,660
the slides already available about a

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,220
coaching experiment for you on your own

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,640
when you come back after the conference

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,400
and we can see that is like facing a

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,570
problem from the points of the community

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,000
your component of you how you can what

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,410
you can do it for the community what are

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,730
the bed and good points of this problem

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,530
see from different points of view is

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,500
very important

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,350
because in a community our designer

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,120
developers marketer business people and

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,820
to see us so you have to see from the

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,230
different points of view this problem

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,970
and not so bright everything that you

00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,890
can forget for me as an example is very

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,330
important because often I don't write

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,580
something because for me is not

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,070
important but for others can be so I

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,900
write everything you are playing with

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,390
dates because you need to face the

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,430
problem during the time document with

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,370
example again people love example

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,620
because they have find everything and

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:22,570
that's so again ask for feedback when

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:26,830
you finish that so now I talk it about

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,630
my experience but I like to leave these

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,820
slides as a coaching experiment too

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,130
because every turn all of the things but

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,070
is now for you to study something like I

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,400
said that you so let's start with

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,740
researches when I started doing coaching

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,570
was the first book on the line suggested

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,100
by the Mozilla community itself and that

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,740
I was thinking why I have to read this

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,390
book but later I chose and okay I will

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,630
read out so all these kind of books this

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,790
is all a list a part of the list because

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,130
it's important to understand that we are

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,490
a community start doing with people and

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,220
people as different needs and there are

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,050
different kind of way to act to face the

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,060
various problem the chameleon face and

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,740
the last link is for me is very

00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,300
important because is one of the results

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,730
of the rest program that we are working

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,310
to create community builder leaders and

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,510
this is a list of other resources that

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:22,170
you can find online so let's start with

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,360
my resources that they did to help

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,190
communities but before I forgot forget

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,740
about so this link this is a coaching

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,270
big guide for mods ilion's because the

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,860
volunteers from Zillah college in that

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:38,770
way I like it a lot this one because was

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,380
made few years ago is an experience made

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,170
by Mozilla and they interviewed 30

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,540
different volunteers and ERG and with

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,460
this information they studied how the

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,350
community is built with different kind

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,779
of group of volunteers and I was one of

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,729
them but didn't know that

00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,379
time and it's interesting to see that

00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:57,599
our like four different kind of

00:19:55,379 --> 00:20:01,859
volunteers what they need wire they're

00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:05,639
joining know what are the interests of a

00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:07,469
community this is one of the last that

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:09,479
they did this part of the rest program

00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:11,609
is conversation between the mentor of

00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:13,950
the rest program with the mentee of the

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:16,799
reps program too and we created a lot of

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,830
slides explanation to the coals with all

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,940
of the amenities available of course

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:27,450
well one and the examples are results of

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,299
coaching is as an example this one

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:33,179
already years ago is a guide that I've

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:35,999
written like now is a thirteen pages of

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,969
my experience of to requite and motivate

00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:40,499
new volunteers and I still working on

00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:43,950
that because there are always new things

00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:46,440
that you can learn because I see the

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,899
world as my high but people see in

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,580
another way so I like to write

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:53,369
everything that they learn because in a

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,229
way that I don't forget but people read

00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,580
that and these are resources for someone

00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:59,099
else

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:03,119
so like open source giving stuff to

00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:04,619
orders this is another one experiment

00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,129
they do again for the modular s program

00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:10,979
is an analysis of different kind of

00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:13,499
developers about browser extensions in

00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:16,080
the case of Italy and what I learn at

00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:21,229
the time what there was the problem how

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,229
I faced it whatever and is public again

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:25,739
but to be a tech speaker because that

00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,950
speaker is a program of Mozilla to

00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:31,320
enforce a speaker like me to be more

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,509
skilled than do joining conference and a

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,820
bit another guide for that about what

00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,320
are the problem doing a talk speak and

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,899
international conference in a language

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,839
that is not yours and all the problem

00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:45,059
all the kind of things that someone will

00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,539
face when have to do the first talk of

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,580
their life so I've written again and for

00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,440
me this is a quite example what is

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,889
coaching for me is the community because

00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,299
developers hate document stuff but it's

00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:03,179
very important to do it so because we

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,909
are finishing I suggest to you when you

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,980
come back at home and want to do

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,259
the homework for you check this video

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,740
because it's a a parody song of event

00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,630
Sousa

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,269
that for me is perfect to get in the

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,730
right mood and they have did a lot of

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:18,980
also other parody songs so you can find

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,200
out so the link of all of them because

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,600
for me is important when you have to do

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,210
something is not for you like again for

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,669
me psychology stuff because it doesn't

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,710
care at the time be in the right mood

00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:33,289
before face all these kind of things

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,539
because you had not have to see like was

00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:37,610
for me something that they say you have

00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:39,769
to read it no you have treaty because

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,259
your community needed because you want

00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:45,309
that your community grow because a

00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:51,429
community that doesn't grow as problems

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:51,429
so now I all the time for your questions

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,650
who would like to begin our Q&A period

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,440
thank you very much for this great

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,390
presentation and I'm very surprised with

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,070
cyclists beside me and you you're

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,170
referring to this mozilla program and

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,630
they must have done a lot of good things

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,850
that you've been like learning from I am

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,800
very much willing to attend but I would

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,470
like to follow the examples that you

00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,570
mentioned and I think everyone that made

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,460
it up here into this last room great to

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,680
be here you must have been like

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,440
interested in community building and I

00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,580
would love to link with you and go

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,350
through the whole process that was

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,930
described like learning from the others

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,570
and especially like from other platforms

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:48,180
as we want to do also matter most we are

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,710
creating a community and we want to live

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,440
by example all the points that you made

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,610
up so thank you very much and feel that

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,220
I will be one of your followers and the

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,990
question is like the first step that we

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,580
can do to connect to make the right move

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,860
what would you suggest to do us I think

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,500
that you need to understand with what

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,960
public kind of public is interested for

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,840
on your community and what is the best

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,370
place to reach them as an example

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,440
starting with WordPress because it was

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,620
one of the most reason for me is meetup

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,300
as an example and Yuri for me I got a

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,250
lot of people that doesn't know that

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,310
WordPress was open source at WordPress

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,530
meetup so I understand and that way as

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:34,290
an example that any to focus the

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,150
communications about explaining what is

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,220
open source so you need to understand

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,440
the target like marketing there is a lot

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,030
of marketing coaching but is important

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,700
because in that way you can do direct

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,350
communication and not so find the right

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,110
tools to communicate with them because

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,330
of an example WordPress uses lack but

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,550
not zeal I use a lot of telegram but in

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,380
the past mailing list so depends of the

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,330
people you have to find the right tool

00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,810
to communicate without so direct message

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,570
that you want to send to people in that

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:05,430
guide that I mention it there or to

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,440
record a motivate for new volunteers I

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,200
split in different sections the various

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,940
people that you can find I liked a lot

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,890
to talk with people understand whether

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,960
the interest has an example talk with a

00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,970
person si okay they speak a good English

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,280
maybe is interested to be a localizer

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,890
now this is a student so maybe want to

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,650
do something to learn I don't know

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,920
how works so I created this document

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:30,770
various way to gather these two on board

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,260
these people and find a way to get their

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,970
interest because people need an input so

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,340
you need to find that their interest

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,860
about something topics that for them is

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,049
very important which students is learn

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,490
something with people that they want to

00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:46,240
do like in their free time maybe

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,510
something that is not time consuming so

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,700
the depends on the various personas this

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,860
is another term you have to find the

00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,410
best way usually is better start

00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,600
focusing and experimenting with a little

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,549
group can be a meet-up or doing a

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,470
specific event in a specific city or

00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:05,720
inside that to working I don't know in

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,730
that way you can have a better idea

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,710
who were to do the next step as an

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,610
example I have now started a Linux user

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,700
group in my city

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,740
that wasn't never I started doing an

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,510
event with the night school classes

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,370
about the spin open source when

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,470
experimenters was perfect but when asked

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,120
a to do they do you see computers and

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,070
the Stalowa server for them was a

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,850
problem as an example because they don't

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:30,530
know how to start a software because now

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,540
meléndez use only the smartphone so I

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,299
learned that now maybe is not better to

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,940
focus with students may be better to

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,950
focus to professional people more adults

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,470
as we can say so with a little bit of

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:46,030
spearmint you can understand where start

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:55,120
and to create a little bit of people I

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:58,669
talk a too much you were talking about

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,040
getting people together on a chat sort

00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:03,890
of platform such as slack or matter most

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,990
or whatsapp telegram but how can you

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,760
convince people to use a certain

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,890
platform because I'm working with the

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,540
community where one person prefers

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,820
mailing list the other one first like

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,040
another one prefers what's up this is a

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,440
common problem that we have the with

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,330
Mozilla tile again we tried with rocket

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,429
shot because was open so where people

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,980
they say ok but so so can we use it but

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,760
we say that a lot of people doesn't

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,010
understand why you have to use another

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,770
app so with which a - telegram later and

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,620
we saw a lot of engagement of the way so

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,429
this is a problem because as we can say

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,169
all people

00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:38,299
they'd love Melanie's we'll still you

00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:42,110
select me that you use air see telegrams

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:44,809
lack altogether but is is important on

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:47,029
this to find the best way to let's work

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,889
them all of them as an example with

00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:51,019
Mozilla Dahlia we do it because we have

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:52,429
the old volunteers as we can say that

00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:55,879
they're part of the committee sent ten

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:58,879
years using the forum only the forum new

00:27:55,879 --> 00:28:01,490
people or the telegram so we started

00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:04,249
doing video call monthly and we have

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,690
people that both joining and later the

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,129
old people's which are - telegram

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,629
because they want to start work

00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:11,179
altogether because they saw people

00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:13,610
face-to-face during a call and now we

00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:16,490
have the last one two days ago

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,059
Meno was going there so I saw people

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:23,419
that way people say each others they can

00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,399
accept to change platform but this

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,460
depends of course on the people and is

00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,470
not easy but you need to try in a some

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,450
way as an example of the step was also

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,399
to think about this course because this

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,230
course as we can say is the meninist of

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,600
the future and now because a lot of

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,139
people is a mix between many list of all

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,600
times by that so the modern times so is

00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:47,269
a unit experiment it's the only way

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,639
because me great everything can be a

00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,990
problem but experiment is the best way

00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,990
okay we do one more question

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,270
thank you for your presentation I mean

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,000
this is not the question just to share

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,100
my experience I'm a computer person

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,450
since I have computers since the age of

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,820
eight I'm 43 years old and I want to

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,700
tell you that I re the coach because I

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,910
made a professional change last year and

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:29,000
I hired a coach to explore and to

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:31,460
fulfill my all to explode all my skills

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,790
and there was the best thing they made

00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:38,120
in my entire life so what I want to say

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,790
to everybody we can be good very good at

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,850
my sequel at Linux at open source

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,220
software but if we are not very good on

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,460
other professional areas like social

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,070
like teamwork forget it

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,020
with my coach I'm here at FOSDEM it's

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,170
very nice and thank you for a

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,390
presentation so I hope everyone hires a

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,390
coach for yourself and for your team

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:07,309
thank you

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:07,309
