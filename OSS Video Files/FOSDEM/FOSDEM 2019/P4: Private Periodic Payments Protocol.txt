P4 aims to solve the problem of subscription services offering end-to-end private cryptocurrency payments. This protocol introduces periodicity to cryptocurrency payments through an ongoing relationship between the merchant and the customer without unintentionally disclosing personally identifiable information. We are creating this protocol to allow us to offer a truely end-to-end private subscription data storage solution built with Tahoe-LAFS. By sharing it, we hope that other subscription services will implement our protocol and further the adoption of cryptocurrency payments in real world retail use cases. 

Although this protocol is currently a work in progress, we have already specified some design decisions. For periodicity, we are avoiding a payment pre-authorization design to keep the user in control of their keys. And for privacy we are utilizing Zcash shielded transactions and the coming improvements in the Sapling release.This protocol is being created by the Least Authority team with support from the Zcash team.

okay so next talk is by Lisa anger on

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,940
private rejected payments protocol

00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,300
everyone

00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:21,700
as you know I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,090
something called P for the four PS of

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,820
private periodic payments protocol I

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,610
think you all can hear me okay so a

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,160
little bit about myself and the company

00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,180
I work for at least authority so the big

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,649
thing that you should know is that we

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,810
believe that people have a right to

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:40,900
privacy our mission is to make security

00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,460
easy and available to everybody we help

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,960
others improve their technologies by

00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,470
doing things like security consulting

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,980
and security audits and we also build

00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,420
technology - we build we also build

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,810
technical solutions that incorporate

00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,850
these values like privacy by design

00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,610
empowering users to control their own

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,829
data and minimizing access that service

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:07,119
providers including ourselves have to

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:11,200
use their data so to talk about how we

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,030
are a merchant or a service provider we

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,100
have something called s for the simple

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,219
secure storage service this is a

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,560
distributed cloud storage product

00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,999
basically but what that really means is

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,859
that it's built using open source

00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,679
projects and enables client-side

00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:30,909
encryption so that the users hold the

00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:33,999
keys to their data not us also the this

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,619
also does charting of the ciphertext so

00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:38,560
it gets distributed across multiple

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:40,209
places for storage - and the service

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,369
doesn't operate on an access control

00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:45,369
list basis but instead works using

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,409
object capability model or key based

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,090
access this is similar to how

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,889
cryptocurrencies work which I'm sure

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,240
most of you know and this is a little

00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:54,130
bit different than having users have

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,409
usernames and passwords to log into the

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,209
system so in other words we don't have

00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,709
any personal account information about

00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:02,229
the cipher texts that people store with

00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,149
us and this is important you either have

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,990
the capability to or the key to access

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,819
the data or you don't and we don't so

00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,340
this brings me to the problem that we've

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,810
run into so we have this wonderful

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,550
problem we have this wonderful storage

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,860
product where we don't need to collect

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,520
information about people in order to

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,830
provide that

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,930
full service itself but to accept

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,570
payments we do need to collect personal

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,400
data at this point in time so in order

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,170
to process fiat currency payments for

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,810
subscriptions we need to collect this

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,350
basic information about them and this

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,120
means

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,200
yeah collecting personal data just for

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,810
the payments which we thought to

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,300
ourselves hey maybe we could change this

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,810
maybe it's possible to do something with

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,660
privacy where we wouldn't have to

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,290
collect any personal data at all

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,490
so of course you guys all know that be

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,440
doing privacy right now

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,930
is a little bit difficult but I do

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,700
believe that the the idea of expensive

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,010
for privacy or difficult the lack of

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,970
convenience in some cases is relative

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,130
and I think that this is easily

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,930
challenged by new technology and people

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:10,780
trying to tackle the problem so what we

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,490
did was we looked and saw we began

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,050
researching what the standards are for

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,150
doing subscription payments with crypto

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,830
currencies and what we found was quite

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,260
limiting and didn't meet our needs

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,970
one current use for ZK shielded

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,010
transactions is to have people prepay

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,630
for their subscriptions or just you know

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,550
cryptocurrency in general people could

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,990
prepay and this works for service

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,690
offerings where you can turn the service

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,910
off and not have to have any kind of

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,709
storage or in the interim and that like

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,970
electricity for example you can just

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,070
turn it off turn it back on again when

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,540
people pay again but in our case because

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,030
we're storing data this wasn't exactly

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,220
the right solution for us because we

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,350
need to hold that ciphertext and of

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,060
course you can use smart contracts for

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,130
managing some aspects of subscriptions

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,650
but this option with aetherium and other

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,290
platforms at the moment is not suitable

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,150
for either the reason that they're not

00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,440
scalable they're not usable to the end

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,060
that we need maybe in the future this

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,010
will be different or in the case of like

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,820
aetherium there's a privacy concern

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,780
there too and so and then another option

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,070
is things like pre-authorization and

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,910
that also is a problem because we don't

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,500
want people to pre authorize payments to

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,510
us because it takes away their power to

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,650
change their minds in the future so if

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,000
they decide that they want to cancel

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,080
subscription in the middle of the year

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,150
or something they should have the

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,520
ability and if they pre authorize us for

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,990
numerous payments or something then

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,500
that's also a problem and then of course

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,810
the idea of you know holding funds and

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,280
escrow things like this in other words

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,050
we weren't satisfied with what's out

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,890
there right now so we thought what could

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,900
we do differently so we talked about how

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,450
to make cryptocurrency work for our

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,640
needs in addition to having the privacy

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,980
so first we looked at privacy preserving

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,860
features in cryptocurrency like Z cache

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,530
shielded transactions we also thought

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,870
about how we need network privacy so we

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,420
looked at tor and we also thought about

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,640
how we need to manage subscriptuin sea

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,270
subscriptions themselves so the

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,340
periodicity off the periodicity problem

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,810
the pre-authorization where we want to

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,250
make sure that the keys stay with the

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,050
people and then data standards just

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,580
general and cryptocurrency space there's

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,800
not a whole lot of data standards around

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,930
how to communicate things like billing

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,040
period due date late penalty stuff like

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,350
that that might come along with

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,730
subscription payments so we had to think

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,190
about how we could do some data

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,290
standards for this and of course price

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,169
volatility you know we got to manage for

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,419
the fluctuations right now especially

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,229
compared to fiat and during any kind of

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,490
transitionary stage so combined this is

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,000
what we came up with these are the

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,030
layers of the different tools that we

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,979
incorporated so grid sync is the

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,380
application layer privacy and this is

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,550
basically just a user interface for

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,280
Tahoe laughs or Tahoe la FS Tahoe la FS

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,070
that project also open-source and this

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,320
is what is used for the distributed

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,850
storage and then Z cache shielded

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,250
transactions for the financial

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:15,380
transaction privacy and then tor for

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:18,930
network privacy so here is the actual

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:22,890
step through of how the private periodic

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,690
payment protocol works so you can see

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,370
the first step is to initiate the

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,940
subscription and we do this via the tor

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,610
browser to make sure that people are

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,590
coming to the web page privately so that

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,060
we don't get their IP address of course

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,530
we have to recommend people don't go to

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,700
our public site and then go to the tour

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,880
site because then we could link that

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,270
together second subscription creation

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,610
and invite code and this is where yeah

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,380
they they basically at that page they

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,450
just tell us that they want to start a

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,210
subscription and so we create a Z cash

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,790
address to accept the payments and an

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,820
initial like database entry to just link

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,620
these things on our side and then we

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,660
generate what's called a magic wormhole

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,640
invite code this is another open source

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,240
project that we utilize and it's just

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,480
basically a way to send the

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,400
configuration file and the initial

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,900
invoice information to people and then

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,880
the third step is the client side

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,590
subscription configuration so this

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,810
happens in the client application grid

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,510
sync and this makes the connection to

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,000
via the magic wormhole to receive the

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,310
initial s4 configuration and the initial

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,080
invoice that they need to pay and then

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,960
it updates the configurations locally

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,970
and kind of interprets the structure of

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,760
the invoice and can start storing things

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,350
on the on the local machine as to about

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,180
their information their invoice and

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,860
their subscription information so this

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,330
way it stays on the client side and it's

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,180
not actually staying with a centralized

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,590
service and then forth they need to make

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,230
the payment and we need to update that

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,940
they paid us on our servers so they make

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,100
the payment to the address that we told

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,630
them to pay to we watch on the Z cash

00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,880
blockchain to see that that payment was

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,400
made and then we confirm it and we

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,200
publish the next invoice and then the

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,970
fifth step is just the reoccurrence part

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,160
with between this invoice in the payment

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,280
and so they their client checks for the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,370
next invoice as opposed to us you know

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,080
kind of feeding that to them and then

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,360
yeah they display the updated invoice

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,520
information to the to the actual user as

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,140
opposed to us doing that in a

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,470
centralized service so that's happening

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,170
client-side so this is what we Specht

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:34,380
out for an invoice this is the string

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:35,760
and so basically this this is just an

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,230
example of what it looks like in this

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,540
example it says the customer is being

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,120
asked to pay point one Zach by a

00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,520
particular date here September 4th for

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,810
the service least authority s4 and if

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,100
the payment is made by the given

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,040
deadline the subscription will be

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,290
extended by one month which is some

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,290
million seconds until the October fourth

00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,080
so next steps for us as we're going to

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,480
complete the s4 implementation that we

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,920
have of the specification the

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,110
specification itself is already

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,000
published on our website I'll put up the

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,280
link next we want to get feedback

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,530
iterate and improve we've got some ideas

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,640
about how we can extend this further

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,230
because this was just a basic

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,140
specification of how you could do this

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,850
privately so like for example there's an

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,040
encrypted memo field and Z cash

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,750
transactions we could utilize those a

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,370
little bit more heavily to do any kind

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,370
of communication maybe even figure out

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,040
how to put invoice data in that we could

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,480
also expand on the use of Tahoe laughs

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,600
because we're having this distributed

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,210
storage basically infrastructure we

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,890
could also use elements of it to to kind

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,780
of communicate in a private manner today

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,630
to the end users about their

00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,120
subscription status we also think that

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,070
it could be cool to work with other

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,180
wallets that are out there and you know

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,740
kind of building this kind of

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,410
subscription management stuff into

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,060
wallets and then also create merchant

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,920
payment with payment frameworks so it

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,750
makes it even easier for merchants to

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,290
handle subscription payments in a

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,390
private privacy-preserving way so yeah

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,120
just in general I hope that other people

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,060
are inspired by this work steal the

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,710
ideas not steal open source but you know

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,010
be inspired by the work to do something

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:19,200
similar to keep privacy in mind for in

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,960
doing more payment type stuff with

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,460
crypto currencies that fit some of the

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,040
more creative business models that are

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,740
out there already so here's the links

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,680
that I talked about on our blog you can

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,360
see the you know short post about it

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,280
along with download the specification

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,260
it's not too bad of a read but it talks

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,450
about the privacy properties of the

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,770
decisions that we've made some of the

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,090
trade-offs and stuff like that that we

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,040
have to make in the interim and also

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,500
it's got even more detailed ideas about

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,310
future work that could be done and then

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,030
also another company did gdpr compliance

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,350
assessment basically of this whole

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,290
specification looking at you know how

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,820
this kind of works with gdpr and that's

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,130
also been published and that's available

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,800
online also and so that's what that

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,230
second link is and then of course the

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,990
contributors from my team and the Z

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,610
cache team and all these people who make

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,769
the wonderful open source projects that

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,079
go into this stuff

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:29,820
so that's it but I I guess I'll leave

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:31,079
this up any questions very interesting

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,589
it seems like a well thought-out

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,329
solution you by not storing any customer

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,399
data you apply it you comply with the

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:41,790
GDP are really well how do you manage

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,350
the risk around there's one exception

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,940
there yeah I'd like to hear about that

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,170
and then my question is how do you

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,180
manage a regulatory risk on the other

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,050
side where you have requirements to know

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,430
your customer and concerns about the

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,670
transparency payments and be able to

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,350
respond to subpoenas yeah so those are

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,600
some other issues that we're going to be

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,910
looking further into in the future I

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,610
have some vague ideas of some of those

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,950
things but I'll start with the gdpr part

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,930
so yeah basically the the compliant the

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,579
compliance aspect of it is that we're

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,610
not collecting any personal information

00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,079
or at least not any that I mean there's

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,880
like little like little little little

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,560
like crumbs of information because no

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,029
matter how much we try to like not

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,250
collect any information that could be

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,660
crumbs somewhere else that then people

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,019
could correlate so we tried really hard

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,320
to get far as far close to anonymity as

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,930
we could realistically but yeah so the

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,399
encrypted data so so that has nothing to

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,380
do actually with the payment protocol

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,610
that itself is great in terms of GDP our

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,399
compliance because there's no personal

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,190
data but in terms of the fact that we're

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,170
doing we're storing encrypted data GDP

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,320
are I mean right now I guess the stance

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,300
is that encryption isn't quite enough I

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,800
don't know there's lawyers that can talk

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,269
to you in more detail about why and

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,279
there's all kinds of arguments but the

00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,430
idea that eventually that crypto could

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,800
be broken and so but then again we're

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,850
not the only ones with that problem the

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,329
whole world has to deal with that

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,970
problem

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,260
so hopefully we'll see some good

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,370
response to that in the future but I

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,870
also think that there's also new

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,670
technology developments that can help

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:17,100
that problem oh yeah the other ones new

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,779
this way yeah I mean I haven't talked to

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,120
a lawyer about the subpoena thing yet

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,899
but I guess we would have nothing to

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,580
give them that's it in terms of like no

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,000
your custom

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,709
as far as again not a tax lawyer but the

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,750
only thing that I've stumbled across so

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,880
far is the VAT problem that we might run

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,680
into that we can't prove that because

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,360
we're a German company so we have to do

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,890
the whole bad thing with our customers

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,110
and so we can't because we don't know

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,579
where they live we can't prove that they

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,200
don't live in Europe so that we

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,630
shouldn't have to pay VAT on them

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,140
so I guess it would just be a cost but

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,519
it's not illegal as far as I know but

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,760
that would be the next cool thing would

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,110
be to shop this around to more really

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,050
knowledgeable lawyers if there's any

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,880
here talk to me and just get more kind

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,860
of assessment on those problems and

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,440
maybe publish some more blog posts about

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,880
like yeah okay if you have no personal

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,980
data and you're doing this kind of

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,700
service then it's cool you don't have to

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,260
worry about all these compliance things

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,640
yeah actually my first question was

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,940
exactly about that whether you're

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,420
compliant with the MLT foreign Tumulty

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,740
five-eights anti-money laundering

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:28,490
directive but my second question is like

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,770
in terms of bsd - it looks like you're a

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,649
bit falling into like a payment

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,060
initiation services like do you look it

00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,579
from that perspective that you actually

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,620
need to have a license they're forming

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,320
such a services and like where do you

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,040
stand in terms of that well I'd have to

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,540
talk to again an expert on that aspect

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,520
of it it sounds like you even know a

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,839
little bit more of the names of these

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,250
things and I do but I mean we're not for

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,140
us were just accept it's just another

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,720
way to accept payments for our service

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,329
so at this point in time if we were to

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,800
implement this for s4 product we

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,290
wouldn't be doing this for other people

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,910
in terms of like moving money for others

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,010
would be just accepting payments for

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,350
ourselves so I would imagine that that

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,930
would not make us any kind of like

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:18,260
financial platform because we're just

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,740
doing it for ourselves but again we'll

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,449
see we have it like half implemented and

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,040
also we would launch this on like a

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,630
small scale I mean the amount of people

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,959
that would pay with Z cash shielded

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,790
transactions over tor for RS for service

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,310
is probably not hundreds of thousands of

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,490
people and so you know I'm imagining

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,899
that we can just talk to regulators and

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,520
and in people and stuff and try to

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:43,000
figure out like what the solution is for

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,470
this but yeah an in terms of like money

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,390
laundering and know your customer I

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,149
think that most that applies to like

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,820
financial institutions but yeah if you

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,260
know lawyers or a tax accountant tax

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,910
attorneys things like that that want to

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,920
come talk to me about this I would love

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,080
to talk to them and work with people to

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:11,380
do a deeper analysis and have better

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:15,850
answers so I'm application developer and

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,190
if I would like to integrate it as

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,410
information available on on the link or

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,890
do I have to setup everything myself or

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,709
how would that work yeah so I mean we

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,450
just SPECT this out for ourselves we

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,640
also we share like I said the thought

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,730
process the analysis of what we did and

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,350
why we did it so right now and then

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,180
we're doing the implementation ourselves

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,410
the code will all be open-source but if

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,000
you wanted to tailor it to a particular

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:45,970
different application then you would

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,550
have to do some work yourself it's not

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:52,000
like a one button solution or something

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:59,490
all right

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,490
