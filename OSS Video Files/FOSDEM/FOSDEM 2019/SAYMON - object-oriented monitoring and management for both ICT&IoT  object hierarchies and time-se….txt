SAYMON is a software platform. It makes possible to build a kind of specific problem solution in days.
There's a great technology stack we would like to describe and discuss on FOSDEM19.
MQTT, HTTP, WebSockets, NodeJS Actors, Redis, Kafka, Hierarchy and Documents Storage, Time-Series Storage, Front and Back Ends.
ICT and IoT SW projects made by SAYMON team description. SAYMON use for tech people opportunities. We will talk for modern technologies and for it's business appliances.
SAYMON architecture review.
Object information model.
Trees and graphs of hierarchies of objects.
Infrastructure and smart things control methods review.
Time-series collections and storage as well as current and future usage - visualisation, simple aggregates and machine-learning.
Event processing. Incidents register and processing. Incidents correlations.
Notifications and alerts implementation aspects.
We will make demo and show cases.

hello ever hello everybody

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,220
nice to meet you here I'm constantly

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,529
Mahalo from Simon team we are making

00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,310
Simon for several years for three or

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,140
four years already so I will try to

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,570
figure out what is it for five minutes

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,949
for you you probably don't know what is

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,330
it

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:32,640
so Simon is a software tool and we call

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,430
it platform because so many things you

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,410
can do with it and it give you freedom

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:45,239
to Medel what do you actually need to

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,540
monitor manage or visualize it works

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,280
fine for both info communication

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,790
technologists and IOT technologies

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,170
Internet of Things technologies and the

00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,350
basic usage in ICT is following we can

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,930
collect information from whatever you

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,050
want resource there are number of

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,840
building checks available you can

00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,840
collect from any kind of zabbix or

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,810
whatever tool you like and you can

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,649
provide mobile interfaces white screen

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,780
interfaces you can provide data source

00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,039
to graph an ax or any kind of custom

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,130
interfaces you can create with

00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:33,619
application so as well we use it for IOT

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,750
there are a number of proof-of-concept

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:40,050
deployments done with a smart factory

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:45,929
with a smart village for energy account

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,979
and so on we have special mqtt connector

00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:52,200
to the blockers and self provision

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,179
self-service front-end interface and IOT

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,560
partial switches which are important if

00:01:54,179 --> 00:02:00,599
you plan to support a lot of devices

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,330
since while since ICO is one of the our

00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,220
custom customers it's a startup they

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:11,540
using IOT devices to make express water

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,610
analysis and the use Simon is a heart of

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,590
cloud to collect all the data and make

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,319
the

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,430
their chemistry magic in the cloud they

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,970
calculate somehow quality of the water

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:30,110
okay Samuel s object-oriented that data

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,650
model which gives you trees of objects

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,060
with checkmated states propagation and

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,180
long-term time series database

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,540
possibilities object is the main thing

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:49,310
there are a lot of building checks each

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,860
object can change its States objects all

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,829
related some kind of classes of objects

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,829
Zehra could be parent object of course

00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,620
could be several parents they could be

00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:04,459
children and it could be a huge tree of

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,790
any kind of nature you one so it's three

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:10,310
there are some kind of special objects

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,930
called links they connect to two of the

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,160
objects this growing from network

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,590
visualization from infrastructure

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,420
visualization that is why there are such

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:25,930
a special objects exist

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,209
last summer we implement multi parent

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:34,160
technology which give you more freedom

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,040
to propagate access to several people

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,310
due to the same amount of objects but to

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,470
serve two different amount of object

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,549
well we have also taxed in the system

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:49,540
and you can take whatever you want

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:54,410
object to link and manipulate it with

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:58,599
text each object as I said have a state

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,599
and this state allows you to propagate

00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:10,010
state of the tree to the parent objects

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,859
so some have very rich native UI with

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,370
all these three plants Jo and mass I

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:18,919
will show you and it's both web sockets

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,889
and pulling request technologies

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,469
implemented it gives you pretty much

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,560
similar to graph on an interface to this

00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:29,570
time serious rows and you can work with

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,850
it we have several things

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,010
which governor have no but they will

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,950
maybe fast implement after this

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,190
presentation okay you have state

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,890
condition editor which allows you in

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:46,400
visual mode to set up what is good and

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:51,770
what is wrong is your object it works

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,020
with all the data you just received okay

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,740
all these things you can do with zappy

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,460
of course this is example of dashboard

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,280
you can create with Simon this kind of

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,880
difference from graph owner

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,620
for example zero amount of widgets we

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,430
support already in this library will be

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,380
growing you have buttons to act you have

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,330
such presentations I need to be fast

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,180
because of organized you have mobile

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,730
apps you have recipe you have custom UI

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:31,640
you have such things in inside we have

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:36,320
open sourced component for distributing

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:39,800
the engines to the clusters we focusing

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,720
to mobile machine learning in the

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,600
machine learning called services and

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,000
marketplace for extensions join us and

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,000
take your free copy of Simon

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,270
