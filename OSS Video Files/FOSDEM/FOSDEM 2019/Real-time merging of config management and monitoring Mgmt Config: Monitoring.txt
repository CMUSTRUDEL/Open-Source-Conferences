Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.
This presentation will demo both and include many examples showing how monitoring is built-in to each resource, and how events can cause the system to react and fix a problem before your pager even goes off.
The language demos will show how you can feed real-time monitoring data from a tool such as prometheus, into your code and use that data to make real-time decisions.
Lastly, we'll talk about our existing prometheus integration for exporting useful information about mgmt. Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
