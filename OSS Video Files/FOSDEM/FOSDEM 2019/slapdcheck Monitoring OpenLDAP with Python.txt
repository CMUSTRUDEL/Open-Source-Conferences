This lightning talk highlights how to monitor OpenLDAP in detail with Python module slapdcheck. OpenLDAP servers are typically used as backed for authentication (login) and other mission-critical infrastructure components.
Furthermore OpenLDAP setups can be non-trivial resulting in higher risk that something could go wrong. 

The talk will introduce the Python module package slapdcheck which implements monitor checks for OpenLDAP servers:
* performance data
* allocated back-mdb pages
* need for restart
* replication state 

slapdcheck parses cn=config to automatically adjust monitoring checks based on current running configuration.
