Fibre to the home opens numerous interesting possibilities for both bona-fide and not so bona-fide use cases.
Having your espresso machine or refrigerator being part of a multi-million device botnet which is attacking critical infrastructure might not necessarily be your first association when zipping your early morning caffeine fix. Fibre to the home opens numerous interesting possibilities for both bona-fide and not so bona-fide use cases.
Having your espresso machine or refrigerator being part of a multi-million device botnet which is attacking critical infrastructure might not necessarily be your first association when zipping your early morning caffeine fix.
Not only might this notion be somewhat disruptive for your early morning zen-moment, you might also be held legally accountable for these actions as it is actually your home network participating in an international attack wreaking havoc on, let’s say, the healthcare information system of a close NATO ally.
Nowadays there is zero quality control being enforced over internet connected devices in general. But the EU (and US) have decided this somewhat naive approach should come to an end. 

A new directive (NIS, Directive on the Security of Network and Information Systems) comes into effect. Especially for branches active in the development of internet connected devices with a direct application in the “quality of life improvement” domain, this will be something to look out for:
Medical devices
Automotive
Domotica 

This new directive includes the ambition of implementing a certification scheme for IT systems and devices, this scheme will be based on the existing ISO 15408 standard: 

“ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009 establishes the general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation given by various parts of ISO/IEC 15408 which in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products.” 

What does this standard encompass? What does open-source and free software have to do with this? 

Let’s have a closer look in this talk!

	00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,259
so the next talk is about the EU

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:30,050
cybersecurity Act and let us all work

00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:33,380
amazons thank you good morning

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,360
it's very heartwarming to see a full

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,149
room of people willing to get themselves

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:44,570
into ISIL norms on a Sunday morning and

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:49,879
I promise to try and keep you awake with

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,230
the emphasis on try so this is me the

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,760
picture could have been taken that first

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,320
time here lost last day but it's not I

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,789
do some amateur winemaking and thought

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,539
it would be good to have a picture in

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,850
which I'm not recognizing it I want to

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,760
talk about cyber I want to be very

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:11,480
precise about what cyber is who knows

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,250
what sideways everyone right or this

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,860
everyone has their own idea about what

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,480
cyber is because we have so many side

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,370
was to choose from it's so nice just

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,760
like you have eyes on once the beautiful

00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:27,830
thing is you have so many to choose from

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:30,590
I love words that mean nothing and cyber

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,140
is just one of them the thing is if I

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,690
see the word cyber in an advert for an

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,630
consultancy company or something I

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,820
usually start counting the density of

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,680
the repetitions of the word cyber and

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,220
the more cyber is in there the more

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,520
likely is it that it's complete

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:53,510
so let's get the side apart but somehow

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,200
people's also have embraced the concept

00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:00,380
that being the word cyber being somewhat

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,970
imprecise being somewhat faith that

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,430
really helps because you can mean a lot

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,590
of things with that and that's nice

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,789
about those the nice thing about loss is

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:14,210
that you try to encompass a concept

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,400
without over specifying it and without

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,020
becoming to technological because if you

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,390
create laws based

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,250
technology than the the one thing you

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,020
know for sure is that the law will be

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,470
outdated to the minutes that it's

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,540
actually being product and this is one

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,080
of the things that I think the EU is

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,470
starting to get right now I like the GPR

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,720
I like the fact that the GD P R does not

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,750
tell you what to do it doesn't tell you

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,500
what you may not do it only tells you

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,240
how you should handle your data how you

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,910
should describe it and how you should

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,890
inform your users or your your your

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,520
clients about this and what their rights

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,710
are

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,600
apart from that you're completely free

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,640
to do whatever it is you want to do as

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,980
long as you describe it and as long as

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,470
you of course remain within some ethical

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:09,500
boundaries but we are moving from a

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,420
situation in which laws are very

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,580
specific about what you should and

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,550
should not do into a more compliance

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,860
oriented society of lawmaking which

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,560
creates a framework and boundaries in

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,650
which you yourself have to perform risk

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,610
assessments miss analysis and implements

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,870
appropriate and fit for purpose measures

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,720
law always comes last

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,209
but it does be technology who saw the

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,990
debates in Australia recently where they

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,360
were trying to ban end-to-end encrypted

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,209
chess yeah but that's what most

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,459
interesting is that there was this

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:51,380
Minister on television and he was asked

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:55,130
about this law sir do you not know the

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,170
laws of mathematics and his answer was

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,860
yes but I do not care I have the

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,460
Australian law

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,250
and my first reaction was a gaggle and

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,200
my second reaction was well yeah he has

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,060
a point because you can have all your

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,850
laws of mathematics as much as you want

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,650
if you're in prison then you have all

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,540
the time in the world to perform lesson

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,210
that is so low bits technology and this

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,480
can be good and this can be very bad of

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,190
course it the law itself is not

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,150
necessarily good or bad it's just like

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,830
technologies but to do with it

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,160
the current cyber security approach in

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,740
the EU is fragmented or at least has

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,950
been in the last decades

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,860
mostly because countries were not

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,610
exactly in sync when developing their

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,940
own security or information management

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,190
strategies everyone basically created

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,960
their own islands and suddenly we

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,270
realized that the internet might be a

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,670
bit of a cross-border thing and then

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,670
somehow well we thought let's regulate

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,520
it a bit in the Netherlands we have the

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,410
national cybersecurity center and not

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,030
only in the Netherlands you have these

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,520
and they have them in Belgium in other

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,430
countries as well and they issue they

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,669
continuous and very comforting stream of

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:22,000
papers or PDFs if you want to be very

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,010
tech savvy and they issue best practices

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,480
and balances on what you should do and

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,470
what you should not do and until

00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,950
recently those guidances and dispensers

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,690
were mostly ignored and who of you has

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:40,000
actually read one of the guidances of

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:44,020
your national I see one too well I must

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,220
be in the right room then and the thing

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,070
is what we've been doing from thee and

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,660
with me I mean also some members of

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,950
Annisa I do provide some input from them

00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:02,169
occasionally but we've been trying to do

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:05,200
is create a basic level of neutral

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,830
information across several business

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,930
domains so we and myself and part of

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,740
several work groups who have to do with

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,110
Pharmacy and health care

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,280
which is a very specific topic with very

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,050
highly sensitive information I mean who

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,270
doesn't want to have life's to have

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,020
their complete patient files open for

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,210
the world to see and we've been issuing

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,870
guidance for some time now and the

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,250
things that we've done is create let's

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,580
say some level of plausible deniability

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,470
and that from the lawmaker inside of

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,960
things we can say look we've been saying

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,340
this for years guys you should follow up

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,600
because now we're going to create laws

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,030
that actually force you or simply not

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,950
necessarily force you up front but we

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,210
can penalize you afterwards if you

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:58,910
haven't followed them so the substance

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:04,130
regulation will be about harmonization

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:07,460
will be about information sharing but it

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:14,000
will essentially also mean informing and

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:16,370
providing tangible tools and in general

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,620
what it's meant to be doing is create

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,660
transparency because in the

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,010
cybersecurity world we hate being

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,680
transparent somehow

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:31,970
we use words like cyber yeah and what we

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:37,130
want to do now is create famous of or

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:40,450
oncology's of well the scripted well

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,580
described passages protection profiles

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,070
targets of evaluation so that the

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,680
industry can see hey I am in this field

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,590
these are the protection profiles that

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,090
apply to me let me adopt them let me

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,070
formulate measurements on them now

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,710
that's the the schemas that will be

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,050
coming forward in the last couple years

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,180
the issue with that is that we're trying

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,370
to do that from anything life and

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,430
internet-connected espresso machine to a

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,310
nuclear submarine and there is a bit of

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,560
a difference in complexity although I

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,630
must admit that most recent aspecial

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,610
machines tend to be very helpful when

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,590
creating DDoS attacks

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,500
so creating transparency transparency

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,410
means little understanding

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,200
it means what are we looking at and when

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,740
I say this is green do you agree with me

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,310
this being green and it ain't easy being

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:40,540
green so much miss page security

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:43,479
strategy the difference that I often

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:47,020
have to explain between the ISO 27001

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:51,930
and the 27000 to whenever somebody asked

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:56,530
me for a - 27,000 - certification

00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:00,220
unlike room no you have 27,000 won

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,720
certification and the 27,000 - it's

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,110
basically a list of stuff that you can

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,840
do or you should do especially if you're

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,150
an oil refinery in the 1990s actually

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,800
that's where it comes from you can do a

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,460
lot of stuff which is in there the

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,260
27,000 Brahman wants you to think about

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,280
what you have your assets you threat

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:28,570
your vulnerabilities your procedures and

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:31,210
what are your grand jurors any family of

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,410
Europe we've been doing this for quite

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:39,910
some time we've had a framework called

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:44,440
gun which is essentially a guidance on

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,870
the quality maintenance of a development

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,830
process in pharma and it all revolves

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,580
around the world the birth traceability

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,800
describe what you're going to be

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,480
building describe how you will be

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,710
billions builders create just upfront

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,230
validators and make sure that you can

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,200
actually trace back from the initial

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,020
beginning where a fixer comes from but

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,650
not only that be very specific on how

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,720
this particular feature can affect the

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,380
quality of life or the risk for the

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,960
health of patients and that's the thing

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,980
that somehow in IT will get a bit

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,980
distracted from the physical world I

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,230
mean we create virtual systems so what

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,510
does that do well if you're in

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,360
healthcare and you have life an incident

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,190
which is creating a tell me not

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,050
password-protected non-encrypted my

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,180
phone network without any kind of

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,940
authentication offering endpoints to

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,880
increase or decrease the incident level

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,990
well that is very handy if you want to

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,650
kill people from children's further on

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:57,370
so we have been making the transition

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,750
from a sixty physical world into the

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,590
virtual world and the same thing that's

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,660
happening on a lower level it's not easy

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,590
for politicians to understand all the

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,440
fine details and nuances of IT systems

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:15,070
or architecture but what they can do is

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,140
they can tell you but they like and

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:22,540
don't like in essence if people start

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,800
dying they don't like that so in pharma

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,040
now here we basically have the feed

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,810
model starting out with describing

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,770
whatever it is you want to achieve in

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,590
the end describing requirements on how

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:39,280
you want to achieve that create design

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:41,620
and in the meantime also make sure that

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,440
you are able to exactly test and

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,060
validate and qualify whatever is in the

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,200
ends and if you're right well yeah this

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,560
is like prince2

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,140
or wonderful methodology true it came

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,580
from the time but in essence edge house

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,830
from is basically a lot of little

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,930
waterfalls so that that works is wrong

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,450
the GDP are I like the GDP are and I

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,520
already told you about why I like the

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,530
GDP are because it doesn't exactly tell

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,480
you what to do or what not to do it

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,150
tells you how you should think about and

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,250
how you should formulate measures to

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,590
ensure that whatever it is you want to

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,710
do does not cause unintended side

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,630
effects or databases or whatnot oh yeah

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,270
and then we have the individuals rights

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,640
who can severely hinder your business

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,530
operation especially if you're a

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,660
marketing company it's very helpful for

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:36,330
people to ask to be delisted from your

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,590
emailing list but those are their rights

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,400
we're creating a competence framework

00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:45,340
the EU company's framework for tech

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,130
education is also another stir

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:51,010
two worlds harmonization of

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:53,680
understanding how to compare educational

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,590
levels if you've got a grade in country

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,810
a work to stop me and country B and the

00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,560
other way around so this is another nice

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,260
little puzzle

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,680
and another part of the cybersecurity

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,130
act is the role of Eliza and and these I

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,710
will get a much more proactive role in

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:15,870
handling security incidents on a EU

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:18,670
level and also very more in-depth role

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,040
in creating information packages and

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,390
also creating the schemas that I was

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,800
just sort of a map for your favorite

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:30,610
espresso machines this literally is a

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,490
copy-paste from a education book for PHP

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:40,660
development I recently came across so

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:44,230
it's like 2019 what can go wrong that's

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,900
not read salon for that whenever you

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,170
feel that you can't fall asleep at night

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,990
go through the ice our websites

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,210
downloads the 15 for arrays which is an

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,260
open norm you can download it for free

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:02,380
and and it's surprisingly readable it

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,100
has three parts the first part is a

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,220
general outline on what it does it's a

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,080
it's a norm on how to formulate

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,040
evaluation criteria so that you can

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,600
actually ascertain if your system is

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,820
compliant to whatever it is you want it

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,089
to be and also how you should formulate

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,540
the requirements up front so the first

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:28,510
part is an introduction on how auditing

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,540
and evaluation generally works blended

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,880
checkers and whatnot the second part

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,500
goes into the functional components of

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,280
an application and I think that's on a

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,630
really reasonable job in creating

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,610
different modules and passages in

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,670
identifying the different parts of an

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,850
application like authorizations and user

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,060
data management and whatnot and the

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,930
third part actually basically

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,180
second part but then the other way

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,670
around know the view model start by

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,640
creating requirements and then start by

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,070
creating

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:07,700
to validate the performance part three

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:11,900
nuts into there this will be a voluntary

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:14,029
seen this but whenever lawmakers start

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,660
talking about voluntary there's usually

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:20,029
something fishy going on because what

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,910
they mean by voluntary is that if you

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:26,420
don't do it like this you will have to

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,430
explain how you do it then and in

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,410
general that will cost you a lot more

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,670
effort than just basically following

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:37,730
this so whenever you read should

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,279
mentally replace it by must that's what

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,960
I do with this there's a couple of

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,450
concepts that you should be aware of the

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,820
target of evaluation that can be a

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,880
system that can be a combination of

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,070
systems it's basically what you see but

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,430
your quantum information domain so if I

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:59,450
have like HR systems and finance systems

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,570
to help in registering employee

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,200
information and to help pay them their

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,420
salaries

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,680
the combination of those system is the

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,780
information domain HR so do not look at

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,900
systems and components alone look at

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,900
functional application domains in which

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,810
you use certain software and certain

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:24,110
information especially which entities

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:28,220
are being used in what system and how is

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,500
their workflow so theories can be

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,830
basically anything you it depends on

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,380
what you wanna target so you can perform

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,270
an ISO fist in for a race like rather

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,030
than Sousa did on an operating system

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,970
now awesome names and test if the

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:46,089
authorization profiles next role this

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,040
actually do what they are supposed to do

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,790
but an operating system by itself is not

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
very useful

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,390
you have blinking lights and if you have

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,410
an espresso machine with an operating

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:59,029
system you will have a special hopefully

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,000
but you want to use it in an application

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:05,179
you want to be able to create a Sabatino

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,910
from it so you need software and then if

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,049
you use a certified platform like

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:14,639
whether the suzer and different distro

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:16,769
also apply once you install applications

00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:19,610
and so precise especially if you develop

00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:22,110
them yourselves that becomes a part of

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,689
evaluation and therefore you have to

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:29,580
describe what it is you will want to be

00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,889
testing and you can register that in in

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,080
multiple ways there's not a fixed way on

00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:37,169
how to describe a theory or anything it

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,249
can be an inventory it can be a box of

00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:44,070
CD ROMs if we even use them anymore if

00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:45,869
you see examples like floppies and CD

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,739
ROMs and launch you have any indication

00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:51,239
of how old they are the target audience

00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:53,850
is basically everyone consumers

00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:55,470
developers but especially evaluators so

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,309
if you have a quality assurance or

00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,529
quality control

00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:09,049
within your organization you should be

00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:13,200
reading up on this help you to create

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:15,600
security requirements and but I

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,980
personally find a bit dangerous is that

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,460
we are looking at security as it being

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:27,299
not directly the same as the application

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,759
for me a secure application it is the

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:32,549
application implemented in the correct

00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,239
way security is not something outside of

00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:40,700
the application identified with it so if

00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:43,830
you create security requirements in your

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,259
architecture definitions includes all

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,299
the requirements in a single source of

00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,409
truth do not create separate security

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,889
packages or separate information

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:57,379
purchases combine them create protection

00:18:52,889 --> 00:19:01,320
profiles a protection profile can be

00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:03,989
firewalls how do we how do we formulate

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,029
what the firewall should do or how do we

00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:10,470
formulate but an especial machine should

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:13,320
do and then a security service is the

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,840
actual instance of determine of

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,359
evaluation so you have the protection

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,980
profile a special machines and then you

00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,980
have the instance nespresso

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,600
so we're gonna skip this little bit

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,429
defining your assets defining your crown

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:35,309
jewels is a very important part also of

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:38,809
the ISO 27001 and assets can be anything

00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:43,169
people systems information both paper

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:45,470
but also your public image it can also

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:48,540
be in essence if you're an organization

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,120
you have a lot to lose when you come

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,250
under scrutiny for not complying to

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,160
cybersecurity legislation and and having

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,500
databases so also bring your formulating

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,809
assets think about immaterial assets

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,700
because they are at least at least as

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:07,559
important and also at least as

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,850
vulnerable define in which the what the

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,010
environments are in which were assets

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,929
resides and also what the interactions

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,740
are with the assets because an asset by

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:18,059
itself is harmless it only becomes

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,890
interesting once it has interactions

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:23,340
with other assets and those interactions

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:26,340
are the points in which an asset can

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,679
become vulnerable in the eyes phenom we

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,290
have all kinds of interesting places

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,790
with arrows and dots thankfully in this

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:39,330
one but the most important thing is to

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,620
demonstrate fitness for purpose and what

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,650
would you know there is insecurity

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,549
testing and tends to though from the

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,570
outside in

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:50,880
we do pen testing we do first testing we

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,970
do we try to overload systems with

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,799
information then see what they do and

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,990
that's all true but the problem with

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,090
especially been testing is that it's

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,460
usually a black box approach the only

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,770
thing you know is that the tests you did

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,440
at that point in time this or did not

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,120
result in a hack but you have no idea

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,340
about the actual state of the system

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,030
under it the system under it can be as

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,740
wrong awards for sorry for just one

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,940
little thing that you forgot to test at

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,610
that point in time so the whole point of

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,740
the 15 for arrays is to do the other way

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,830
around to look from the inside out but

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,710
 this system do and per interaction

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,710
how do we protect these interactions how

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,419
do we know what title comes in and out

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,779
of an Internet

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:43,309
how do we test if that still is valid so

00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:46,009
and then apply measurements which are

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,629
sufficient and corrects for the

00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:53,049
circumstances in which the system is

00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:56,299
being deployed so functional components

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:58,549
the target of evaluation and repeating

00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,440
this terms because you will be hearing

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,820
them quite a lot and now you will

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,869
already have heard them a couple of

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:09,169
times so it will become easier over time

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:12,619
you must ship you should create security

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:16,009
function policies / components and those

00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:19,429
are the scope of control in which you

00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:22,669
decide where the measures you implement

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:25,219
start and finish and then you can if you

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:28,279
have a component you can go all out like

00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:31,219
creating measures to defend the building

00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:33,619
in which the server resides on which

00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:35,149
your application runs but that's not the

00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,669
point of this row the point is that you

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:40,519
create measures that actually have a

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:43,309
relation to the components more or less

00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,709
that you don't need to go across

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,739
multiple hops defining measures from

00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:51,529
multiple components within one policy

00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:53,389
you should create different policies for

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:56,389
different components and you should

00:22:53,389 --> 00:23:00,649
evaluate if they match together and how

00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:03,649
well they integrate well I will be

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:08,899
publishing my site summary then you

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:12,289
cannot sleep on the part two defines a

00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:15,619
number of different functional areas in

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:19,759
which you should create the the

00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:21,739
refinement packages and just read up on

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,049
them it's it's fried a comprehensive

00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:26,599
list and what's especially useful about

00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:28,669
this I started ranting about the word

00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,950
cyber and the lateness of the word cyber

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:33,919
this actually creates a common

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,229
vocabulary and what we mean well at

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,269
least what the ISO committee things we

00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:41,329
mean were certain terms and you can

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:43,009
agree or disagree with how certain terms

00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:45,200
are formulated but at least we all speak

00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:47,279
the same language or we disagree that we

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,000
speak the same language but still

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,200
and then we have part three so for every

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,870
functional chapter that you define

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,380
messes on or requirements on you have

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:03,429
then the evaluation criteria for the

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:06,340
message that you've taken and we call

00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:09,970
those composed assurance packages which

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,830
are matched requirements and evaluation

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:19,750
criteria so that's the traceability

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:21,700
thing well the amount of time or not

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:26,380
profess decided not to go this was the

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:29,230
best part I have Fanny I'm a defined

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,080
anyway so I hope well across a bit of

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,639
the idea of what traceability means how

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,059
you should formulate components and

00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:41,559
packages and I think I won four hours so

00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:44,350
if anyone has a variable do it if anyone

00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,480
has a question for now then speak now or

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,850
forever of your silence we have time for

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,460
one question

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:56,289
it was very enthusiastic at all thank

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,919
you for the presentation my question is

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:01,210
very simple what you've just explained

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,159
exists for a very long time now it's

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,990
good that the EU has decided to and

00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,990
