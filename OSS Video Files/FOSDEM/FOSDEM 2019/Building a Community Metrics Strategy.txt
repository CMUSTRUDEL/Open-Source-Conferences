You probably know that community metrics are important, but how do you come up with a plan and figure out what you want to measure? Most open source projects have a very diverse community infrastructure with some combination of code repositories, chat, mailing lists, wikis, forums, and more. Deciding where to focus and what to measure across these many technologies can be a challenge. 

What you measure can have a huge impact on behavior within the community, and you want to make sure that you are encouraging people to contribute in sane ways by measuring the activities that matter for your project. 

This presentation will cover how you decide what to measure and provide some examples.

I'll be discussing the

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,530
strategy thank you for coming on

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,140
[Applause]

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,260
thank you everybody can you hear me in

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,880
the back okay awesome so you can find a

00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,800
copy of this presentation it's already

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,020
uploaded so you can find it on fast

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,290
wonder blog slash speaking or it's also

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,020
uploaded on the FOSDEM site so it's all

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,860
there so you have it already now as

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,930
you'll notice throughout this

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,910
presentation community metrics

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,910
strategies are indeed based mostly on

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,900
cats with measuring tapes so that's the

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,280
primary thing you can take away from

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,800
this presentation I have actually spent

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
more than twenty years working in the

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,480
technology industry and for most of that

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,450
time I have indeed been focused on open

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,190
source and metrics was always a big part

00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,030
of my work with an open source projects

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,730
as director of community fat puppet we

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,070
used our metrics dashboards to provide

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,310
updates and recognize community members

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,680
before puppet I was community lead for

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,140
Intel's open source Technology Center

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,860
where I did similar things with me Joann

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,040
ties and metrics I just finished a PhD

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,650
and as part of that work I did a whole

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,140
bunch of analysis for the Linux kernel

00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,820
mostly looking at mailing lists but also

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,909
its source code data and a few other

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,400
things I'm on the governing board and

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,590
I'm a maintainer for the chaos project

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,900
which Brian mentioned and I will talk

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,790
about more later in the slides and it's

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,590
a Linux Foundation project open source

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,070
project based on community health

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,659
metrics for open source projects I

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,570
joined pivotal back in October so

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,689
relatively recently to focus on open

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,880
source strategy and right now I'm mostly

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,610
working on our open source strategy for

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,380
contributing to kubernetes so of course

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,520
I've been digging into some kubernetes

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,280
metrics since we're talking about

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,780
community metrics strategies I am gonna

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,880
start with how I think about community

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,450
since this drives how I think about

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,790
metrics and I tend to define community a

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,010
bit more broadly than how I see some

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,320
other people define it so we'll start

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,690
with that when I talk about people I am

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,320
indeed really including all of the

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,460
people who work on the project so I'm

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,830
talking about core

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,140
product developers release managers

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,580
Quality Assurance localization and other

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,820
people who contribute to the product

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,490
itself application developers who are

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,130
maybe using the API or other features to

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,560
write applications on top of your

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,240
product through applications modules

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,350
extensions things that build on top of

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,630
your project users people who actually

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,470
run your software and with any luck

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,120
maybe provide some feedback vendors so

00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,890
the companies who are creating their

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,050
products based on your project and

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,240
hopefully giving some engineers back to

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,370
the project as a part of that work and

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,290
then other contributors people who are

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,930
working on promotion organizing meetups

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,820
doing moderation documentation and all

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,340
of other stuff that happens around open

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,770
source projects some of these people

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,140
contribute as part of their day job on

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,030
behalf of the employer and others

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,800
contribute on the free time but they're

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,750
all really important parts of your

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,790
community now before we dive into the

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,950
strategy let's talk about some of the

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,930
ways that you can use metrics so metrics

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,160
allow you to measure progress to see if

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,740
you're achieving your goals

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,050
so using metrics to measure whether you

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,610
are successfully achieving your goals is

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,900
a big focus for the rest of this

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,390
presentation so I'll talk more about

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,300
that a bit later but as you're defining

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,130
your goals it can also help to use any

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,870
existing metrics that are already

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,780
available and just sort of lying around

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,430
to learn more about your community and

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,410
explore in more detail how people are

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,690
currently participating and this can be

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,900
a really valuable input into your goals

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,310
and strategies another use for metrics

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,910
is to look at your community over time

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,380
to spot trends gauge interest you may

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,480
notice that people are showing a lot of

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,850
interest and something you didn't really

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,500
expect and knowing this might help you

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,250
encourage further contributions in that

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,190
area on the other hand people might be

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,840
showing less interest than you had hoped

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,220
in another area and this gives you an

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,950
opportunity to dig a little bit deeper

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,480
and talk to people to understand maybe

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,590
why they aren't as inter

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,860
and something that you thought was

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,020
really really valuable or really cool

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,750
however one of my favorite things about

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,830
metrics is that it tells me more about

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:48,190
who is contributing to the project the

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,830
people make the community and for me the

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,730
people are the most important element of

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,500
the community

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,520
so my metrics do tend to focus more on

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,020
the people than anything else and

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,580
metrics not only tell you who

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,680
contributes to your project but they

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,440
also tell you where they're contributing

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,690
within the project and this allows you

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,520
to learn more about your key

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,030
contributors and I like to use this also

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,070
as an opportunity to recognize them it's

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,720
nice to recognize that person who maybe

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,670
answer so many questions on the mailing

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,930
list or maybe you contributed something

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,760
awesome that a bunch of other people

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:28,840
enjoy using now when I say start with

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,850
the goals I don't mean is to start with

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,500
your goals for the community I actually

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,900
think you need to take a few steps back

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,840
and start at the very top so what's

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,140
important for your organization or for

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,610
the project as a whole now this is

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,990
typically been a company in my case

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,610
except which for lots of big companies

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,110
that are doing up and source but it

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,610
could be an organization like the Linux

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,260
Foundation it could also just be a

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,900
project like the kubernetes project

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,070
instead of an organization and you need

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,960
to start by looking at what the

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,690
organization or the project hopes to

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,510
accomplish and what its goals and

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,850
strategies are and its objectives and

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,940
then you can take this down a level to

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,820
start to figure out what your goals are

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,550
as a candidate and as I mentioned

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,290
earlier looking at some existing metrics

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,990
can also help you explore what people

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,090
are doing now as input into defining

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,900
your metrics or defining your goals for

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,340
the community what I think the most

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,220
important part of putting together

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,170
strategies and plans for your open

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,880
source contributions is really aligning

00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,070
them with these overall goals for your

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,560
project or organization if your goals

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,690
for the community don't support the

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,370
overall goals for your project then you

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,630
aren't likely to be successful because

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,969
the community is just doing

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,159
Rann

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,899
things that nobody cares about so it's

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,719
worth the time to figure out what you

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,879
actually want to do and how it supports

00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:52,159
the rest of the project or your

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,129
organization and once you figure out

00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,449
what you want to do as a community and

00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,039
can tie it back to the bigger

00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,469
organization or the project as a whole

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:05,629
then you can start looking at using

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:06,860
metrics to measure your progress now

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,029
some of you might be thinking that

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,279
starting with the goals really isn't

00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,839
that important so I'm gonna spend a

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,729
couple of minutes talking about what can

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,889
go wrong and trying to convince you why

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,149
the goals are important but I think it

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,119
falls into a couple of a couple of

00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:22,159
different areas so first you you just

00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:24,259
won't know if you're successful if you

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:25,669
aren't measuring the right things and if

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,139
you aren't measuring the things that are

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,419
important for your project or

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,339
organization you won't know if you're

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,159
making progress in the areas that you

00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,259
actually care the most about and second

00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,029
measurement actually impacts behavior

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,279
and this is something that is really

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,259
important to think about people will do

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,449
different things depending on what you

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,939
measure for example if you public

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,409
publish metrics that focus on the number

00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,479
of mailing list posts and that's the

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,889
focus for your metric you're likely to

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,289
start getting more mailing list posts

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,289
because we're vain and we want to move

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,759
up in those in the rankings and if what

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,050
you're trying to do is maybe get more

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,819
people to contribute code to your

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,769
project or get more people to do

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,599
something specific then additional

00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:08,349
mailing list posts probably aren't going

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,349
to help you all that much

00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:18,499
now I love data

00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:20,119
so measuring open-source project success

00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,639
is kind of a hobby and I'm pretty

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:24,669
passionate about I'm not sure what that

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,519
says about me this is my hobby but

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:30,739
that's such as it is but as a result

00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:34,159
people tend to ask me a lot of questions

00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:35,719
about metrics usually the questions are

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,659
focused on how to decide what to measure

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:42,139
and people often ask for examples of

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,699
projects with the best metrics but I

00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,370
really don't think that's a good

00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:47,930
approach what you measure depends on

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,180
your goals and what you're trying to

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,430
achieve which may be completely

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,290
different than other projects so I

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,559
really prefer to encourage people to

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,610
start by defining their goals and

00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,439
ultimately you need to look at your

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,029
strategies and plans to come up with

00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,939
criteria that will help you measure

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,559
whether or not you're successful for

00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:08,149
example if you want to improve the

00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,579
performance of a particular piece of

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,379
open-source software you'll want to have

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,230
success criteria and measurement based

00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:16,790
on specific types of performance if you

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,620
want to gain influence within an

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,420
open-source project maybe you need to

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,050
measure increases in contributions or

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,459
the number of employees moving into

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,059
positions of leadership or positions of

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,699
influence and as with any good

00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,800
strategies and plans the outcome and the

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,240
results should be measurable so that you

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,399
can actually tell whether or not your

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,439
efforts were successful and this is

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,689
where your metrics come in handy once

00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,949
you decide in your success criteria you

00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:45,889
need to make sure that you can actually

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:49,550
get the data that's required to measure

00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,870
these things and measuring it start

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,509
measuring it now to get a really good

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,209
baseline for what you have and there are

00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,819
loads of tools available to measure this

00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,500
stuff so there's lots of lot of tools

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:03,679
available to gather a contribution data

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,269
about open source projects and some of

00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,720
the commonly used tools can be found in

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,550
the Linux foundations chaos project and

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,379
which I'll talk about later and many big

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,480
projects already have dashboards using

00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:19,040
these tools and other ones to display

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,240
contribution data for the project now

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,009
that I've talked a lot about focusing on

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,230
the right metrics for your project I'm

00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,110
also going to recommend measuring other

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,520
things that

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,020
just aren't even important to you now

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,660
and going a bit overboard on your

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,900
metrics because I love data so just I

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,340
just want more data but you may not

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,370
spend much time looking at this data now

00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,510
but it might help you later because

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,910
there are there are a few things that

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,130
can happen so the obvious is that your

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,720
project goals might change and something

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,400
else might matter in two years that

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,350
don't doesn't really matter to you now

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,420
and if you've already been capturing a

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,850
bunch of data you can probably track

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,640
progress towards this new goal with some

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,680
existing historical data and the other

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,570
piece and I think this is probably more

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,000
likely and maybe a bit more important is

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,830
when something unexpected starts to

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,090
happen so this is actually one of my

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,860
favorite things about working at open

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,690
source project is you just never know

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,820
the direction the people will take with

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,460
the stuff you're working on and how

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,500
people will use that software so with a

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,060
really robust set of metrics then you

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,800
can dig in and learn more about

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,230
something that you didn't expect to see

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,080
and you might need to adjust your goals

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,880
based on some unexpected things that are

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,260
happening in the project so now that you

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,170
have a whole bunch of awesome metrics

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,020
you actually need to do something with

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,490
them so historically most of the places

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,860
I've worked I've reported metrics

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,050
monthly if you work at an organization

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,060
that doesn't really get community or get

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,370
open-source monthly is probably pretty

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,440
good cadence when I worked at puppet

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,780
they were a bit more savvy and so I

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,350
think I reported metrics quarterly up to

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,030
the exact team but being able to show

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,550
frequent progress and again

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,610
the stuff that you're the stuff that

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,130
you're showing people is are the metrics

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,530
that actually demonstrate whether or not

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,420
you're being successful so being able to

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,220
show frequent progress to help justify

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,810
what you're doing and show that you are

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,140
indeed making progress towards

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,730
accomplishing your goals as I mentioned

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,230
I was at puppet I did a short report I

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,330
think it was about quarterly for the

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,670
exact team that was focused on actual

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,170
participation in the community I don't

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,080
usually bother tracking things like

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,070
people who join just to lurk I only try

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,800
to count people who've actually

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,560
contributed something whether it's go

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,020
door Docs or answering questions any of

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,089
those sorts of things we also did a blog

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,399
post on the puppet labs blog one

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,120
a month the focus less on the numbers

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,769
and more on recognizing contributors and

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,180
for this report there was a lot of human

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,160
filtering that happened

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,749
we sometimes highlighted someone who

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,120
made some important but small

00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:55,439
contribution that just wouldn't have

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,499
shown up in the you know top

00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:59,910
participants list and we also attended

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,910
to filter out people who had behavior

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,910
that we did not want to encourage people

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,449
who were using up lots of people's time

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,550
and not a lot of not a lot of actual

00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,740
output and instead we put a heavier

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,970
focus on the people who were helpful and

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,829
answered lots of questions from other

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:22,800
users now I also wanted to provide some

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:25,499
example metrics the show how metrics fit

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,240
into your strategic efforts so at

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:29,699
pivotal as I mentioned earlier my

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,309
current focus is on putting together a

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,309
strategy for our open source kubernetes

00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:39,089
contributions so I'll focus my example

00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:41,610
metrics on pivotal and kubernetes lucky

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:44,069
for me the San CF has metrics for all of

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,779
their projects including kubernetes so

00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:47,879
this was really a great starting point

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,339
for me to better understand the existing

00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,559
kubernetes community they use dev stats

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,059
to build their metrics dashboards which

00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:59,309
you can find it a link at the bottom of

00:13:54,059 --> 00:14:02,730
the slide but first let's start a quick

00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,290
discussion about vanity metrics so when

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,970
I talk about vanity metrics I'm

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,779
referring to those metrics that make you

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,999
look good

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,259
but that don't actually tell you much

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:13,050
about whether or not you're really

00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,759
successfully achieving your goals so

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,679
I'll admit it like anyone else I look at

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,079
these metrics and it feels pretty great

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,480
when you or your company are moving

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,550
moving up in the ranking but I try

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,069
really really hard to keep these vanity

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,740
metrics out of my strategies and plans

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,639
since they don't really tell you much

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,079
about whether or not you're being

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,120
successful for example let's say that

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,809
your organization is moving up in this

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,949
ranking it looks great but what if

00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,959
you're moving up because you have a

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:45,720
rogue employee or possibly group

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,299
employees who are gaming the metrics by

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,949
submitting a whole bunch of trivial one

00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,880
character changes each is a separate

00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:55,279
commit with a separate full request

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,930
so this is going to drive the commuter

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,649
pull request numbers up for your

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,990
organization but likely at the expense

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:06,170
of your reputation as you annoy all of

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,730
the other contributors now I know I know

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,950
none of you would do this none of your

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,959
colleagues that do this but then that is

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,190
actually a real example of something

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,959
that's happened more than once it's in

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,490
the kubernetes project and we have this

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,990
discussion and the contributor

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,079
experience say got a fairly regular

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:24,110
basis because companies people at

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,519
employees at companies do do this and I

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,470
know this is kind of an extreme example

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,180
but there are plenty of other ways that

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,430
people can participate that would drive

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,160
numbers up without actually helping your

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,589
organization achieve its goals so I just

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,209
encourage you to be a little bit to be

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:43,310
aware of the vanity metrics now in

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,470
kubernetes most of the work is done

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,500
within various special interest groups

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,810
or SIG's so the kubernetes contribution

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,000
strategy that I'm working on at pivotal

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,339
is focused on coming up with specific

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,980
strategies for the SIG's that are

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,959
important to us so that the various

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,610
teams across pivotal can understand

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,610
where their contributions to kubernetes

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,050
you can have the biggest benefit and and

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,820
be aligned with the SIG's that are going

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,010
to be important for not just current

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,250
work at pivotal but also future work I

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,709
put it all and because kubernetes is

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,230
such a massive project with daily

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,779
changes there is no possible way that

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,430
one person can possibly understand every

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,990
single detail of every single thing

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,779
that's happening in the 30 plus SIG's

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,000
and the dozen or so working groups so to

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,740
be able to build a strategy for our work

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,500
within kubernetes I need to be able to

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,630
find out who I can talk to to better

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,790
understand what we've done so far in

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,550
addition to what we might want to do in

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,560
the future and also you know pivotal is

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,390
not not huge but we're not a small

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,850
company so finding these people can be a

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,199
real challenge and one of the things I

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,510
did in my first couple of weeks at

00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,699
pivotal was to start to dig into the

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,589
existing metrics that the CNC already

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,750
has to understand our current project

00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,570
progress and who's already been

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,279
contributing within and who's been

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,230
contributing to which SIG's within the

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,669
kubernetes project and this helped me

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,169
find some people to reach out to and

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,579
gave me

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:11,199
baseline for where we were already

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,699
active now here are also a few snippets

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,949
from a grimoire labs

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,209
dashboard that came from butter Chia

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,039
with a few more details

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,539
showing Fidel's contributions to

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,220
kubernetes over just the past three

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,720
months

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,449
so before looking at the kipper Nettie's

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,279
data I had never really used dev stats

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,009
so it probably has some features that I

00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,230
don't know about but I found it a little

00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,359
a little bit limiting compared to the

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,799
dashboards using grimoire labs as far as

00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,309
really digging in and figuring out what

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,739
individual people were doing what I do

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,169
love about these grimmer labs dashboards

00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:45,549
is that they're built on top of Cabana

00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:47,919
which means that I can filter my view of

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,559
the data on any field available in the

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,730
database which is pretty cool in this

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,090
case I've just filtered it on

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,070
organization name to get the github

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,629
commits from pivotal but I can also

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,789
filter on a single person or a positive

00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:02,739
time zone a bunch of a bunch of other

00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,820
stuff that's in the database and I find

00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:06,609
these really useful for better

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,220
understanding how individuals are

00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:11,230
participating within a community for

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,519
example if I look at contributions from

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:18,669
from Honus who's up at the top there

00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,440
from our London office you can see that

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:24,220
he's removed a whole bunch of lines of

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,200
code which indicates he's been

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,669
contributing to existing files right so

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,549
he's been removing things adding things

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,989
and contributing to existing stuff and

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,049
he's done this across a number of

00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:36,879
different repositories Ben and Leah on

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,149
the other hand who worked together on

00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:42,820
kubernetes for Windows in our New York

00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:45,129
office have only added lines during the

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,359
time period that I used mainly because I

00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:49,320
could get this as a good example i

00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:52,840
shortened to the time period drastically

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,700
but it corresponds to the kubernetes

00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,759
enhancement proposal that they just

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,289
submitted for Windows node support and

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,730
you can also clearly see in the in the

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,859
top you can see the time zone split

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,480
right between our Bay Area office our

00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,830
New York office in our London office

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,590
which is where most of the kubernetes

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,239
work happens which is kind of cool to

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,739
look at but again this really helps me

00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,830
understand who's contributed to

00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:18,809
kubernetes from within pivotal

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,580
and which areas we've contributed to but

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,519
with a few more details than what I

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:28,200
could manage to extract out of the Deaf

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:30,809
stats dashboards now when getting

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,010
started with metrics there are a couple

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,620
of different approaches that you can

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,480
take before you start building anything

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,840
it's a really good idea to look around

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,059
and see what kind of existing dashboards

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,380
already exist that you can use many

00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,840
projects already have these dashboards

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,289
like the CN CF dashboards for kubernetes

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,059
that I used as a starting point and you

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:54,600
can also take the DIY approach so I've

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:56,039
also done a fair bit of this and built

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,559
my own dashboards gathered my own

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,840
metrics it requires a bit more technical

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,039
know-how but it's a good approach for

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,490
people who have the time and resources

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,139
to build and maintain your own metrics

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,789
if you have really simple needs you

00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,230
might even be able to just easily hack

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:13,830
something together with the github API

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,149
is those are pretty easy to use for most

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,970
people the tools that then the chaos

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:20,100
project like grimmer labs tools for

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,889
example augers another one are a pretty

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,380
good starting point dev stats is also an

00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,510
open source project itself under the cnc

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,120
f so you can always use that there are

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,919
loads of other tools still called

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,330
measure that Jeremy Garcia from data doc

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,210
has been involved in and presenting

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,610
about but loads of loads of different

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,399
tools you can use by far the easiest

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,500
choice is to pay someone so pitcher Tia

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,049
does this whole disclaimer I'm on their

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,250
advisory board but they you can get

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:49,320
companies like that to build and

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:53,460
maintain the dashboards for you which

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,110
requires way less time and butter dia

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,159
for example uses all open source tools

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,190
so you're also supporting their

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,559
contributions back to open source

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,029
projects which is pretty cool but in

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,470
general I recommend kind of doing a

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,740
little bit of all three if you possibly

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,809
can and doing them in this order because

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,260
you can use the existing dashboards see

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:16,440
how much of what you need already exists

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,850
requires a lot less time then if you

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,830
have the time the skills required hack

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,130
something together using some existing

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,350
tools and which if nothing else is a

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,200
really great learning experience to help

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,150
you figure out exactly what you need and

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,500
then if you want someone else to

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,640
maintain your dashboard you can pay

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,800
someone to do that it's also really

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,160
important to think about other metrics

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,440
and measurements that aren't necessarily

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,960
in a traditional community metrics

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,250
dashboard there are loads of things that

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,170
I've used over the years to measure

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,640
whether or not we're successful that you

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,280
might not find on the traditional

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,260
dashboard for example when I was at

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,610
puppet one of the things I tracked was

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,410
whether we were increasing the diversity

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,590
of speakers at our annual conference

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,600
which was one of just several measures

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,090
that we use to determine success towards

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,720
becoming more more inclusive and more

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,280
diverse within our community and loads

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,590
of these diversity and inclusion metrics

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,570
aren't often found in traditional

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,920
dashboards but they're a really

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,510
important part of measuring whether

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,230
you're successfully achieving diversity

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,000
and inclusion goals for your project the

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,530
chaos project again also has an entire

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,410
working group devoted to diversity

00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,400
inclusion metrics for projects that are

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,380
really important to your organization

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,550
you might have goals around having

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,340
specific people move into leadership

00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:37,890
positions or especially in key areas

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,630
within a project and the leadership

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,480
positions available so they vary widely

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,650
depending on the project but they can

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,140
include becoming board members

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,070
maintainer zkk emitters reviewers but

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,660
it's important to measure this

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,180
separately because these positions

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,670
rarely if ever appear on the community

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,320
metrics dashboards and many people who

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,270
move into these leadership positions

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,910
spend quite a bit of time reviewing

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,380
contributions which means that they

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,150
often actually have fewer commits

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,650
themselves and this means that the

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,720
dashboards may actually show them as

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,890
having decreased contributions when

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,410
they're actually doing more within the

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,910
project and having increased influence

00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,030
so it's important to look at that a bit

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,430
separately in some cases you might have

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,170
specific features that you want to

00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,150
contribute or specific issues that need

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,700
to be fixed in these cases you might

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,770
want to measure a specific item like a

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,810
specific pull request merge a specific

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,220
bug fix or some other contribution that

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,260
you need outside of the metrics

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,910
dashboard so in other words as metrics

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,640
dashboards are great I love them I love

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,999
data but you'll likely need to find

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,739
other ways to measure

00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:41,109
things outside of your dashboard to

00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,669
build a complete set of metrics to help

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:44,759
you determine whether or not you're

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:47,319
actually achieving your goals

00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,269
now I mentioned the chaos project before

00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:50,979
and if you're interested in working on

00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:55,149
metrics I would encourage you to join

00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:58,629
and participate in chaos so it's an open

00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:00,279
source project whoo I had several people

00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:01,959
in here are in the chaos project

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,029
unsurprisingly since this is a metric

00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:06,759
stock but it's an open source project

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,709
it's under the Linux Foundation and we

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,449
welcome anyone regardless of your skills

00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,879
so while we certainly have people

00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:15,069
writing code to build metrics tools we

00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,989
also have a lot of people coming up with

00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:19,719
metrics and writing descriptions for

00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:21,609
them so we also love people who can help

00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:24,549
us promote chaos presenta conferences

00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:26,259
and all sorts of other tasks so this is

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,349
something that's personally I'm just

00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:31,479
incredibly passionate about there's the

00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:32,979
link to get you started we have three

00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:34,479
working groups so there's probably

00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,799
something of interest to you if you're

00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,749
interested in metrics we have one

00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,279
focused on growth maturity and decline

00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:40,929
of open source projects we have a

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,669
diversity inclusion and then we have one

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,789
focused on metrics that don't fit

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:47,799
anywhere else and we have mailing lists

00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:50,889
we have a general weekly call each of

00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:54,219
the working groups has various calls

00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:56,139
that you can participate in and as I

00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,459
mentioned before anyone with any variety

00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:59,319
of skills can participate in chaos

00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:01,209
project so that's my shameless plug for

00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,699
an open source project that I am

00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:05,829
particularly passionate about and with

00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:07,329
that there are three minutes for

00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:08,859
questions and if the next figure wants

00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:10,650
to come up and get set up that'd be cool

00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:13,749
too thank you

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,749
[Applause]

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:30,250
so what questions do you have for me

00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:33,250
today hi sorry how do you begin to

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:36,789
measure say the diversity of a

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:40,929
particular project on any axis of

00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:42,309
diversity so so the question was how do

00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:46,630
you measure a diversity within an

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:48,490
open-source project the I wish I had

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,340
like this awesome magic bullet for that

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,230
because the reality is it is it is super

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,480
hard to measure diversity and inclusion

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,529
within a project so within the diversity

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,720
and inclusion working group we actually

00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,070
have seven different focus areas that

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,980
we're looking at so we're looking at

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,830
things like our year are the events for

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,570
your project do you have a you know

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,159
attendees that are diverse in various

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,570
ways and we have a whole bunch of

00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,399
dimensions of diversity that we've

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,860
defined so it's incredibly it's

00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:20,169
incredibly complex a lot of times it

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:21,760
comes down to one of the ways you can

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,580
measure it is by actually surveying

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,350
people and asking them how how they feel

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,269
within the project do they feel included

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:33,399
do they feel like it's a diverse project

00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:38,169
you can measure attendee demographics

00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:40,269
for events and participation yeah it's a

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:41,950
because it's such a wide topic there is

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,269
no single answer to that I would

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,590
encourage you to go to the diversity

00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:51,130
inclusion repository for chaos and have

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,690
a look yeah just its kind of interested

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,580
in that because I'm surveying people

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,460
from an underrepresented group you're

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,590
you you're liable to get the answer you

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,929
know Ferno say I'd have thought in quite

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:05,399
a lot of cases so yeah it does seem to

00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,399
be hard yeah that's really hard

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:12,090
there was a talk this morning in the

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,300
Python dev room that tried to answer the

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,450
previous question so I suggested to you

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,450
check it out later on because there's a

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,340
video of it and you can personalize

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,720
those a recommendation for a job or

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,640
termination just it's already done ok

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,810
it's on different

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,660
luckily fosston records everything

00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,940
because they're awesome alright

00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:46,560
microphone in transition we have another

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:47,620
question I'll give it up yeah so when a

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,740
small question

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,740
