You probably know that community metrics are important, but how do you come up with a plan and figure out what you want to measure? Most open source projects have a very diverse community infrastructure with some combination of code repositories, chat, mailing lists, wikis, forums, and more. Deciding where to focus and what to measure across these many technologies can be a challenge. 

What you measure can have a huge impact on behavior within the community, and you want to make sure that you are encouraging people to contribute in sane ways by measuring the activities that matter for your project. 

This presentation will cover how you decide what to measure and provide some examples.
