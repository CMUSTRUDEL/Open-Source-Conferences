A company register is a centrepiece of the legal existence of firms in a given country. Usually, these registers are state-controlled. 

Can we conceive a register that is decentralised? 

We will present OpenGreffe, an Ethereum-based register based on simple legal foundations of the French Code Civil. What is OpenGreffe?

It's a public blockchain-based registry of firms, in the sense of "société de fait" of the Art. 1832 of the French Code Civil. 

This registry open but is maintained by selected agents, based on reputation. To kickstart reputation: we can base it on existing real-world business reputation. 

Each entry in the registry is consisting of: 


a company identification (name, associates, capital)
an Ethereum address owned by the associates
a stamp of approval by a registry maintainer
a date.



The goal: make it possible for anyone to register a company and build reputation for it in the Ethereum world, so as to raise funding, loans, use insurance, etc. 

Lifecycle of a registration


Some founders agree on starting the business.
They share an Ethereum address on a multi-sig wallet.
They go see some 2+ existing registry maintainers (like Legalstart plus another lawyer company), and ask them to perform KYC/KYB to verify that capital is well shared and that they indeed aim to work together on some projects.
The registry maintainers commit the change to the OpenGreffe database.
The founders can start building their Ethereum-based business, using the Ethereum address that has been written in the registry.
After some months/years, for example some external auditors (like Euler-Hermes, an insurance company) can start scoring the new company for their credit defaults and account payables. Good news: they give an AAA rating, because the founders did well!
After some more time, when the founders want to raise a loan, they can claim being proper on their credit payments thanks to external auditors!



All of this, without the use of any state institution! 

Notes: 


step 6 is possible thanks to OpenGreffe only. Indeed, without the registry, good account payables behavior on a given Ethereum address couldn't be linked to a company identification.



Question TBD: why do we need anything other than an Ethereum address? Why identify associates and a company name...?

	00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:26,550
okay hello happy to be here so I'm going

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:29,130
to present to you open life first of all

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,199
so this is no working software

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,190
it's just Proceedings of a hackathon on

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:40,560
which we worked at the year starts with

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,960
any designer audience and the basic team

00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,710
a team is about making software that

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,450
opens you up and I give you a brief

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,080
introduction about why we are talking

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:57,510
about this so first it's about creating

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,900
companies how do how does the process

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:06,689
work and how to make it like more open

00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,490
and so this is called in cooperation so

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,490
creating company incorporation is the

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,799
same same thing incorporation is today

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,049
is a closed process which is basically

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,689
updated every 50 years I'm taking France

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,609
as a reference since that's where were

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:31,020
working on that and and we wanted to try

00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:35,670
to apply lessons from open source world

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:40,380
through to that and also make things

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,859
public on public blog chains so as to to

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,600
be more ok so as to be more vegetable

00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:50,969
and and have I have public records for

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:57,420
companies which is maintained

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:59,909
collectively brief words I'm going to

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,109
tell you about how incorporating work

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:09,270
today so as I was saying it's a closed

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:12,659
process me it's written in law and it

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,659
doesn't change much and it's tedious as

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,459
you can imagine especially in France and

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,250
the last thing is that it's

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,640
and this process is entirely owned by

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,109
entities called graph and which is which

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,150
are state managed and so what what we'd

00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:36,000
like to do is to start from base

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,730
principles about what does creating

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,099
company mean and try to do this with

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:47,069
code and an update that and keep state

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,099
on the blockchain about that so I'd go

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,470
through it's not really from the basics

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,909
and that will be most of my what I'll

00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,900
explain during this talk so based based

00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:06,150
attributes about the company as I as I

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,409
wrote down some pseudo code name list of

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,560
associates of founders and an amount

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:17,370
which is allocated to the company which

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,900
is usually called capital company indeed

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:25,430
is a is name is defined as a very it's

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,260
very cool as being a set of associates

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,299
bringing capital together to work on a

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,859
common goal and that's an actual

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:37,079
definition of a company I'm just going

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,979
to augment this with a neat erm address

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,720
because basically if you want to make

00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:49,169
business on the blockchain you'd like to

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,959
have that and the idea there is to have

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,750
a smart contract so which is going to be

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,810
a record in which we are going to insert

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,849
new companies and as they are inserted

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,329
it means that they are created and you

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,759
can identify them from now on

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:10,500
so this process is basically mimicking

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,180
are doing very much close here at the

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,379
same thing as what's going on in real

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,609
life when you incorporate a company

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:21,509
actually but really based on only the

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:26,310
core principles of it I'm going to

00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:29,610
explain now how this would work in

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,960
actual real life and this is

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:38,509
the the code that we did is working more

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,819
or less as so associates again found us

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,430
set up for example movie TCG address and

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,159
which they are going to send the capital

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,270
and so the amount which we want to stop

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:54,780
doing business they submit this to open

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,810
to the Open Graph record then as a

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,759
second step it's important that there is

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,009
a verifier which is which is going to be

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,449
an entity a company something which is

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:12,419
going to do the work of looking up the

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,949
associates making sure they exist making

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,319
sure that the capital has been allocated

00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,080
and do basically all the stuff that you

00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,930
need to do to make sure that things are

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,699
in order once very files have done their

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,289
job is that's the point where account

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:31,310
the company actually can be we can say

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:35,190
that it exists from from this point on

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,169
and then the last step is just to give

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,909
sense to all of this you do that so that

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,360
other businesses can you look you up

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:44,069
afterwards and so for example so I'm

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,240
going to show an example of what we try

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:51,389
to do so these melodies steps one and

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,839
two so basically you just upload some

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,610
data about the company to just just all

00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,379
the things you need so as to identify

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,550
the company along with an assumed

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:05,159
address and then that's what we're I was

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,560
saying to give sense to this if I am

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:09,240
another business I can for example if I

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,219
want to start doing business with an ATM

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,189
address okay I will look up the ATM

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:17,659
address through a tool like this one

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:20,339
that is that like this screenshot and

00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:23,490
and find okay like this address

00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,469
indeed corresponds to a business and I

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,689
have details about this business so its

00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:34,830
resolution of business based on address

00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:37,599
on the term addresses and this allows as

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,960
I said identifying companies

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:44,219
based on their HMO address and this or

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,009
those two other what I think are

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:50,199
important values of why do you want me

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,059
to register and copper in companies it's

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,099
building long-term trust because then

00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:56,050
your any business that you are going to

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:57,249
do with this company if you have to

00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,419
doing good business you're going to

00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,969
build trust if you are doing that

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,259
business you are going to destroy trust

00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:05,139
on your company so that's basically a

00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:08,379
reputation system and also

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:11,919
accountability of associates as you can

00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:15,809
look who they are based on the company

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:21,520
you can you can sue them for example -

00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:25,619
if something goes wrong and so what I

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,979
explained there is actually based on

00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:31,629
actual low concepts especially what is

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,050
called society on participation in

00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,939
inference rock which arose to create so

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,099
doing this would create a sociopath

00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:45,669
specimen which has unlimited liability

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:47,259
and you know you can't do much of of all

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,529
the like

00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:54,610
Viggo's the things with it so basically

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:56,409
you can't build contracts based on the

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,539
company identification you always have

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:01,629
to link contracts back to the associates

00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:07,469
so it's very limited but it exists so

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:07,469
there is kind of a legal ground to that

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:16,539
so now I've explained in some quick

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,879
words how status I start from the base

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:23,019
principles of what is the company and I

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:28,779
try to and we try to - to build a new

00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:31,360
kind of incorporation process now how is

00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,810
it interesting so I think first of all

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,719
it's opening a closed system so which is

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:40,300
most of what other similar broaching

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,360
projects would be doing replacing the

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,020
monopoly of crafts notably it's doing

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,510
things more auditable and secure

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:54,240
so as you move processes on chain you

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:56,550
can audit and verify them you can the

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
verify process verification process

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,210
could be we can think about moving it

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,390
more on chain so that's that would be an

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,130
interesting topic it allows doing on

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,230
chain business because I'm making a

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:11,000
mapping interim addresses to companies

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,620
and I think one of the interesting

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,280
points there is also that it opens up

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,800
the discussion about how the process of

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,230
incorporating a company is working and

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:30,530
that's where maybe it relates most to

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:33,440
the open source values of that so yeah

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,070
I'm repeating myself a bit there but

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,400
trying to bring up a sauce goodness to

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,680
to existing processes which are today

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:49,610
managed by law is one of the goals of

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:53,130
that yeah I guess I'm done if you have

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,920
any feedback I'm interested in that and

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,800
I as I was saying that's more about like

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,920
opening discussion and trying to think

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,830
about ways we can move existing legal

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:21,500
processes to code and innovate on that

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:21,500
Thanks any questions

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,810
so the company cooperation also needs to

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,070
be registered with the state or which is

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,820
just enough to do this thing and the

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,680
state recognize it yeah so indeed you

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:49,190
don't have to register on the company

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:51,950
through traditional means - so let me

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,930
state it another way so if you do the

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,290
process as I've explained and only this

00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:00,590
process you will be recognized as

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:05,260
society on participation inference so it

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:08,720
doesn't bring a lot of legal you know

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:12,110
protection or staff but it actually

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,270
allows you to start doing business so

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,950
that that's what I was saying starting

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,720
from base principles it doesn't bring it

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,210
at all all the order of the existing

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:29,900
legal frameworks it's just about the

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:33,100
very core how many companies did you

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,250
incorporate with the system and now

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:41,480
[Laughter]

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:45,130
perceived by officials so as I was

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:50,210
saying it's just like it's just an idea

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:52,130
that we that we did were working on a

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,800
hackathon so that that's that's more

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:59,570
than at the idea stage and I mean as a

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,340
as a developer what I found interesting

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,520
maybe that answers kind of to your

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:08,360
question is is to try to think about

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,570
blue as being as being a set of rules

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,940
that we could include somehow the so

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,640
that's more that's more of that right

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:21,010
like the the the result of what what we

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,010
did I think is that not more phenomenal

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:29,470
yeah yes I think very interesting thanks

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:33,260
also so was it related to legal hackers

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:37,220
no the group where they try to bring law

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:40,529
and come yeah I heard about that

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,170
but no yeah but I think it's interesting

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:46,140
because you have a similar concept also

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,029
in Germany for example where people can

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,200
do business but they have this kind of

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:54,050
yeah so City on party personal and doing

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,510
it on the chain then you are more

00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:00,300
accountable and everything you do in

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,279
this corporation then it's on the chain

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,050
and if you have to do your text

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:08,600
acceleration also you just say oh it's

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,600
here and that's it yeah

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,770
explain a bit more about verifiers how

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,620
do they work - they verify the amount

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:25,140
and also the identity for example if

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,740
someone registers in my name then is it

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,630
going to be the force yeah so I haven't

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,250
talked about that I've got this much but

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,709
very files would need to be doing so

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,260
what what we call due diligence or it's

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:42,390
kind of know your customer it's called

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,270
several ways but you would have to

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:48,390
verify that the actual people that that

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,430
for example own the multisig address are

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,620
indeed the people that are really going

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,779
to be registered so this would need to

00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:00,470
be done off chain right and this is the

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,470
agent have solution to that for now

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:19,790
very still time for a couple of

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:24,140
questions if alright snipers in half an

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:27,160
hour break for lunch and next talk will

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,160
