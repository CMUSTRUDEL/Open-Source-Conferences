MicroPython is an implementation of Python designed to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems. These devices don’t have many resources (CPU, RAM) and so it’s important to write efficient scripts.
This talk shows how to make the most of your resources in MicroPython, and has some fun demos! MicroPython is a reimplementation of Python which is specifically designed to run on computing devices that have very few resources, such as CPU power, RAM and storage.
Often when you write scripts in MicroPython you want to make the most of your available resources, and have code run as fast as possible (faster code usually saves power, which is important when running from a battery!) and there are certain ways of writing MicroPython code that are more efficient than others. In this talk I will go over the tricks and techniques for writing fast and efficient Python code in MicroPython.
The talk will also include some hardware demos to show off these techniques.

	00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:12,160
so yeah what is mica pies and all about

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:18,160
Python it's a reimplementation of Python

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,710
3 so it's aimed to be efficient to run

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,019
on a microcontroller and in constrained

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,689
systems so it's not Python as you know

00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:30,119
it from the desktop computer it's Python

00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:32,739
as we implement a reimplementation of it

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,450
there are a lot of different development

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:38,020
platforms out there already that shipped

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,670
with micro pricing pre-installed so you

00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,230
have the official micro pride in PI

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:48,550
boards and so cameras that run micro

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:51,250
Pisan has optical recognition Adafruit

00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,050
has a circuit Python bought part of my

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,220
crop isin and they are doing it doing a

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,550
lot of hardware and supporting the

00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,500
community in quite some big effort then

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,240
there's BBC micro bid there's a company

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,829
named pyke home so it's already quite a

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,720
lot out there if you want to try it out

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,350
you can also try it out online on our

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,150
homepage in a simulator micro presence

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,610
had started about five years ago with a

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,710
Kickstarter campaign Daymond George is

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,750
the creator of it he is an Australian

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,280
physicist who was in working at

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,850
Cambridge at the time he had the idea of

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,979
putting Python on a microcontroller so

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,050
he ran this kickstart and turned out to

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,690
be quite successful so there was a lot

00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,610
of interest in having a high level

00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:34,690
scripting language running to control

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,060
low level hard Hardware this was about

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,820
five years ago and since then a lot has

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,310
happened some of you might know the BBC

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,159
micro bit for example which was given in

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,820
the year 2016 to about a million

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,869
children in the UK so that they learn

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,540
teaching that they learn Tizen in school

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,340
with the with microphone on the BBC

00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,450
micro bit so they get interaction from

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,939
hardware and software and the people

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,760
think that might be quite some fun then

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,280
there's been the first O'Reilly book

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,030
from nicholas stoller programming with

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,030
micro Python

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,230
there's an open-source project which is

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,910
hosted on github and it's about 7,500

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,230
stars so it's quite popular in its

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:28,570
growing and also my crop isin has been

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:32,230
into space what Michael Python aims to

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,390
be is on the one side you want to have

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,740
low-power applications

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:42,730
it wants to be small in size of in terms

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:45,670
of code it doesn't like to have a lot of

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,500
storage space to run in and of course

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,210
the most pressure time it wants to be

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:58,980
fast so all this combined together it's

00:02:52,210 --> 00:03:01,390
kind of most efficient well I'm gonna

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,250
speed this up a little bit want to talk

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,940
I'd want to do a little live demo today

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,280
with the new Piemonte which is the

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,770
second generation of the official micro

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,330
PI and PI bonds so I have one here

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,280
connected to my PC which runs as an

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,630
access point because I made up my own

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,060
little wafer to make sure that's gonna

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:25,840
be working hopefully so I have someone

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:31,990
that supports me in the audience very

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,780
good and I'm gonna log in through a web

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:40,590
wrapper which you can see here so I'm

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:44,440
gonna disconnect it again and connect

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,290
it's gonna can you all see that it's

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,990
gonna ask me about the password and now

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:54,100
actually connected into the device the

00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:58,900
gentleman in front has gonna run a

00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:03,570
little code that I have prepared first

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,570
I'm going to read some sensors

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,860
[Music]

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,860
Mike

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,790
so now you should see a blinking LED

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,530
maybe not forever and some noise some

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,350
people if I might hear it and you can

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:36,240
see it's reading sensor so it's sending

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:41,000
it back to my machine and we're gonna do

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,000
some more fun stuff

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,889
so now you should you should see some

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:34,940
code running on the LED tile on the so

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:38,150
what I'm so what I'm trying to say is

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,919
it's really easy to set it up I have a

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,500
little excess point you made myself with

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,250
just a few lines of code and talking to

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,750
a device over there and the audience so

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,569
how the first thing how easy and

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,569
convenient is to reduce micro Python and

00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:02,889
yeah that's basically what I wanted to

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,889
say so are there any questions

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:35,469
thank you very much Christine welcome

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:35,469
you guys the next speaker is something

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,650
some water if you

00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:14,480
okay now we are unmuted

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,360
away like hello Internet and the

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,360
Internet

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,070
[Music]

00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:47,610
only have to wait thank you very much

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,610
