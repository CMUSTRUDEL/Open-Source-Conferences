This talk is about SUSI.AI - an open source conversational framework developed by FOSSASIA developer community. We will talk about current development of the project including the overview of SUSIâ€™s technology stack and the recent released hardware prototype. 

The motivation behind the project was to create an ecosystem made up of conversational web services, AI technologies, search engines, smart devices and open source communities - together develop a framework as an alternative to dominant players like Alexa, Siri or Google Home. The project is based on the principle of privacy and collaboration. It provides user freedom and enables user to have the complete control over his/her own data. SUSI is capable of chat and voice interaction and by using APIS to perform actions such as music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information. Additional functionalities can be added as console services using external APIs. It is able to answer questions and depending on the context will ask for additional information in order to perform the desired outcome. The core of the assistant is the SUSI.AI server that holds the "intelligence" and "personality" of SUSI. 

The application already comes with clients for all major platforms and services including mobile phones (iOS, Android), web clients and plugins for chat services like Slack, Gitter, Skype and many more.

hello everyone thank you very much for

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,269
being here today

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:17,470
I submitted to talk about soo CAI and

00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:21,040
open-source voice interface and luckily

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,840
the core developers of this project I

00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,770
want so here today we did not know that

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,710
he would be able to make it so I take

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:33,489
this opportunity to invite him here and

00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,079
also the two of the fathers here so that

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,719
we can have a conversation together

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,399
which is more interactive instead of me

00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,890
presenting project as a community

00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:47,109
outreach we have more insight of the

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:50,379
project so we can let's talk now a

00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:54,219
little bit about myself my name is Tom

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:58,300
Fulton I came from Vietnam I'm one of

00:00:54,219 --> 00:01:00,819
the contributors of force Asia I'm

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,729
currently working in Berlin but rarely

00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:11,920
travel to theater Singapore and other

00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:14,350
country in Asia I in the SU CAI project

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm one of the community outreach go out

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,410
to talk to tell people about how cool

00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,760
the project is and what we we want to do

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,310
with with Suzy and something personal I

00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:32,110
lie swimming and I like to teach people

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:39,070
how to swim and here next to me

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:42,370
I have Mario Billy he can introduce

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,360
himself thank you so hi my name is Mario

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,190
and so I lived many years in Asia and

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,710
yeah I also helped to get the force HR

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,020
community started and for many years I'm

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,970
sharing an interest in search engines

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,300
and we talked a little bit more about

00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,300
this later and and that's how I met

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,850
Michele who is the founder of yashi net

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,890
and the great coder behind it so that

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:10,700
was many years ago and when was that

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:15,230
Misha one of the first was Asia when

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:20,030
it was the yeah in the Indian deceiver

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,280
yes somewhere in the late so yeah I'm

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,319
glad that we are in vitae chair and

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,940
great to see many people interested so

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,730
my name is Michael Michael Christine and

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,680
as Mario said I created

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,560
Yesi peer-to-peer web search and this is

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,940
big data and distributed systems which I

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,030
did large-scale data systems organizing

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,120
data and so on so Suzie was just the

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,370
next step to follow up with the idea of

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,739
search engines but we will hear about

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,739
this in detail so I'm doing the core

00:02:51,739 --> 00:03:00,680
architecture of Suzie and I'm happy to

00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:04,310
be here to help okay so what exactly is

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,630
Suzie AI in the past they said even

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,459
before I was born

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,160
people already imagine how they can

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:14,480
communicate with the computer via voice

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,570
and they turn their wish into movies in

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,220
series and we can see in Star Trek how

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,329
they try to communicate through a mouse

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,790
with the computer so what happened these

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:32,690
days we are now be able to talk to our

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:35,269
phone and devices so anything that you

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:40,430
can see a lot these days in the market

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:43,430
the very Q speakers but they label is

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,310
small speakers so why it's a small

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,239
speakers in the past the speaker's is a

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,180
divided that produce audio output so

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,329
that you can listen to some music small

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,239
speakers mean that now you not only you

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,700
listen to the music but the device are

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,079
able to listen to you and be able to

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:09,200
perform some kind of action or to answer

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,680
your question or do some kind of task on

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
your behalf

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:23,010
so as we can see most of device out

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:27,540
there dominate by major tech player

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:30,150
player Google Apple Amazon Microsoft and

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:36,210
some big Chinese provider like Sony or

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:39,620
Korean producer Samson where and we

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:43,530
haven't find any free and open source

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:51,750
personal assistant that being introduced

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:54,000
in this few up to now this is the slide

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,240
that I saw in a lot of presentation

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,900
about conversational web the researcher

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,600
mentioned that next year seventy-five

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,380
percent of the u.s. population will own

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,410
a small speaker and this is a really big

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,450
market and you can imagine that within a

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,730
year from now you give April 2 sweet to

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,460
any devices you can speak to your phone

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,140
your your laptop or you have a car you

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,610
can even speak to your to your car you

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:32,780
can come in and tell the system to turn

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:35,760
on the life for you isn't it cool no but

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,310
what is the side effects of this so when

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,040
we have all the device connected we are

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,730
a network will be able to do we be able

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,940
to control our lives and every single

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:50,760
item or object around us is it a good

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:55,620
thing or gladly it is always been a big

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:58,620
new page in the market right and some of

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:04,500
you may have seen already this article

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:07,620
on CNN about the Google home and the

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,800
East dropping action how the device

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,400
actually listened to your conversation

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,320
and transfer it to the central system to

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,250
respond to this Google said that they

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,260
only deactivated function but we never

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,900
know so this is only one case that being

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,250
published on the new but there's also

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,950
many auto

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,900
so our concern is what gonna happen with

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,030
our data in the future where everything

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,090
is connected and it was also the

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:44,490
motivation why we want to to beYOU to

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:47,880
see AI we need a free and respecting

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,060
privacy system to a personal assistant

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,950
that was the answer for the question

00:06:51,060 --> 00:07:04,410
what is to CAI how did we start the

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:11,760
project in the beginning so this is the

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:14,640
team behind Susi we also have hundreds

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,640
of developers from everywhere from from

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,660
India from Vietnam many different places

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,160
in Asia in some coming from Europe but

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,690
unfortunately we cannot bring 100 people

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,680
here on stage even though we would like

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,710
to thank every single one of them just a

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,630
little bit about the background of Susi

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:40,770
so it's originally started by Misha air

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:44,840
the reate o of yes a.net and maybe I

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,840
don't know anyone here using yeah c.net

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,000
one person wow so good so how about we

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,410
effect disability to explain to be for a

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,950
little bit about ya see what is the

00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:00,180
reform train yeah see and Google so this

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:02,280
is the basic this slide points are the

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,070
difference between centralized search

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,830
and decentralized search so if you have

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,020
and and connected with the question what

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,520
is distributed so a search engine like

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:20,120
every large-scale search engine Google

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:23,330
Bing and everything ads they they are

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,330
disability cuz

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,909
they have a lot of service and the task

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,409
is distributed to all these servers but

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,050
they are not decentralized they are

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:37,310
centralized so at this routed system

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:43,310
which is centralized and what I wanted

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:45,320
to do is to switch from distributed not

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,260
each tantalized system to a distributed

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,420
and decentralized system so take all

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,269
these computers apart and make a big

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,040
network out of it and control all the

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,149
all this data there's a peer-to-peer

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,250
network so it's like it's like file

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:12,850
sharing but it doesn't share files each

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:15,320
has indexes another project they share

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,240
substantial amount of code together with

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,630
the zoo CAI which is another project

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,850
called lock lock and enforce Asia we

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,740
have been working for several years on

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:31,430
the social media data engine block lock

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:36,610
against this point was started by Mario

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:41,829
and Michael in 2014 at the key oak and

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,829
the ACCC we could not fire

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,110
okay

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,500
so at this time at the CCC 2014 we could

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:06,290
not manage to find a big data sought to

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,720
play with so we stock the Lok Lak

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:15,860
project so the idea of lack of project

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:18,620
is to harvest social media data to play

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,800
around with and form the data so we

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:25,130
collect all together two billion tweets

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,870
from from Twitter and then when we have

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,680
a huge amount of that we were thinking

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,329
so what we can do with it so we start to

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,579
index the data and and make sure so

00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:38,810
instead of having the normal shells

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:42,610
box we also try to see if we can do a

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,980
question and get a reasonable answer

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:58,850
from from from these data and that was

00:10:45,980 --> 00:11:03,440
also the stock of Zhu CAI project okay

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:07,040
so another thing that we realized here

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,010
so we have the Google home and Alexa

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,839
echo at home ourselves so we try to test

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,339
it and see what we can do with evolve

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,930
because we at the moment bills will see

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:22,130
what we realized is that whenever you

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:25,220
have a question to add the device every

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,470
few month and we'll give you a different

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,300
angel and you would not be able to

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,670
perform some time that you were able to

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,589
perform two months ago for instance over

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,510
Christmas this year I tried to play

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,910
Oscar go home to play some Christmas

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,829
music it was possible last year but this

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,649
year's asked me to sign up for a premium

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:45,860
account on positive five in order to

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,560
result for for my song and it's really

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,720
tricky somehow if you also judge open

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,300
the browser on your laptop to be able to

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,949
display the music from Luton from from

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,399
YouTube but it's not possible on the

00:11:54,949 --> 00:12:01,300
speakers and they said on so the reason

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,290
why we think that is important to have

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:09,700
a smart speaker that is how do you say

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,890
is provide transparency and the

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,120
information that not that will buy you

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,770
the freedom the choice of listen to do

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,860
what you want to hear instead of

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,540
somebody push the information in to you

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:31,149
based on some kind of partnership with

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:33,220
the provider but what our expectation

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,500
form of smokes assistant

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,300
so it's mentioned that beside playing

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,240
music whatever we can do what kind of

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:46,630
business domain that we can tap in with

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:50,080
so CAI maybe you can say a little bit so

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,510
I think there are many different things

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,089
that we could do with a smart speaker

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:58,480
and we can look at like search engines

00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:01,270
how they do this today so actually if

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,800
you use search engines years ago there

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:09,190
was always like a list of websites with

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,950
links to but nowadays we see many

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,230
answers already and you are search

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,839
engine experts Misha so maybe you could

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,550
tell us a bit about your experience what

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,540
what do you see how how has it changed

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:26,320
over the years now what what do we get

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:30,370
as an output two questions we ask to

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,630
search engines the first step which was

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,279
observable was semantic enrichment like

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:40,180
another display of more information

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:42,940
about a topic but now if you if you try

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,880
to search at Google with a complete

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,880
sentence then Google gives an answer in

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,970
a complete sentence or if a complete

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,329
list of what you have to like if you ask

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,520
about cooking it's like you get a recipe

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,180
and you don't need to click on a search

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,089
result you actually get yet here's the

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,240
example if you ask for how to cook

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:10,029
spaghetti then of course you get you get

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,970
a search result but not at as the first

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,620
set at in the beginning you get a

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,320
complete answer you don't

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,470
need to go to the webpage anymore so

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Google is starting giving direct answers

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,390
to direct questions so and this is

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,110
business makes it visible how the steps

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,450
from web search is going to smart

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,370
speaker you already have this on the web

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,170
page in a search result

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,110
you don't actually don't need to map

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,930
anymore to get answers so in the future

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,670
if you if the next generation very not

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,230
recognize anymore that there are search

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,260
results that you can go to a web page

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,590
you just get direct answers so it's

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,960
obvious that the interface should change

00:14:50,590 --> 00:15:01,090
and should change only to giving direct

00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:03,790
answers to your questions and yeah not

00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:06,100
just answers also actions so for example

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,600
like it's possible to and play songs

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:13,600
directly or to play videos directly and

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,200
yeah for example an output that we were

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:22,590
thinking also is charts or diagrams so

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:26,380
any kind of media could be performed by

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:28,420
voice or by voice can also be like your

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,210
TV could be have a voice interface and

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,260
show screens as well and you could also

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:47,110
imagine that you control a RvR so it's

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:48,910
just a normal user interface so the next

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,970
slide would be a lot of people actually

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:54,010
come to us they try also see online and

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,400
they said okay this is not working and

00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,310
what we want to do people don't believe

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,740
that we can do something that can

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,450
compete with the major tech player

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,490
so what add the opportunity out there is

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,650
it something that feasible that possible

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:13,270
to make an open-source personal

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:15,220
assistant or it is just an idea for fun

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,950
but we do not do it for fun we'd really

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,540
want to make it possible and then and

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,790
then we do believe that it will happen

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,280
so whenever people ask that if it were

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,930
open so it's not gonna be successful

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,120
then we will keep its number of

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,040
Wikimedia what

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,499
the biggest the dictionary now most

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,019
people use Wikipedia is sure listen to

00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:35,790
some of the motivation we believe that

00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,910
with the oak with the power of the

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,470
community we can make things happen and

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,910
we are here to share our idea and we

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,579
hope that people would join up with us

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,850
with the same vision and same believe

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:52,819
that we can build something that relates

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:55,649
alexa or google home this with another

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:58,259
example of a successful open source

00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,660
project wordpress i don't think and of

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,029
course linux we don't need to do for the

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,459
next plenty of successful open source

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:11,880
project out there and and and we believe

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:14,130
that susie could be one of those I can

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,459
with the power of the community I think

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,589
that we definitely able have the

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,039
possibility to achieve amazing amazing

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,589
things and they'll go of to say it's you

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:30,090
this power to be machine that can answer

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:34,679
all the question the people could think

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,090
of our fantasy day is because a lot of

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,309
people working on the fields there

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,649
already a lot of question available out

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,890
there through the huge dataset of the

00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:46,409
world wide web and we can also use the

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:51,779
day dynamic web content and tap into

00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:54,179
open API or JSON web services they these

00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:58,140
all these data and neighborhoods to

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,850
provide content for our system and for

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,779
the answer in response of so say for

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:06,539
instance you can you can call an

00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:09,059
external API on on weathers and answer

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:15,230
all the question related to weather

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:19,200
forecast for instance so hours approach

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:21,210
to build the entire ecosystem that make

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,940
us engage a lot of people in the

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,470
community to be different client for for

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,220
Susie and they also like different

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,220
component and

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,020
joining the service in different ways so

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:38,220
there are a lot of challenge out there

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,860
but whatever decision we take what we

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,770
want to do it to give the user a choice

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:51,660
to limit the storage of personal data on

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:52,440
on the cloud so what is the progress of

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,820
the project

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,230
what kind of components already

00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:02,160
available in the Susi air I so right now

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:06,990
in front of us I have the SUSE smart

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,680
vicar prototype so this is a very simple

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,540
prototype you with the Raspberry Pi

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,140
microphone and the speaker head so

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,720
basically it only plays one task which

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,210
is play have you to play the music and

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,100
the reason why we want to do this is we

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,650
want to have a prototype to show people

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,260
that it's possible to do something with

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,420
with open-source a majority of the

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,190
people who own the device they only used

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,730
to divide to play music this is the

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:44,550
majority interaction of the user based

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:46,920
on some research so what specific should

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,810
I say about a difference so we wanted to

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,280
make it easy that everybody can rebuild

00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:56,460
this thing so we didn't put on special

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,770
hardware of something which is difficult

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:04,140
to get so this is just the respect pi3

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:07,230
and for 10 euros microphone hat we did a

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,030
lot of experiments with microphones USB

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,720
microphones and it didn't work very well

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,350
so 10 euros for they are two microphones

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,860
on it

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,920
it's called

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:22,370
receipt to microphone hat respeaker

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,790
receipt of city the company is called we

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:30,920
received seats to you I'm sorry I messed

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:32,960
it up but if you can ask us and there's

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,600
also it's an inner documentation but we

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,570
use so all design parts are of course

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,530
available as open source and this small

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:50,540
piece of 3d design also as well and we

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:55,010
have an raspbian version we forked or

00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:57,410
Espeon repository and made our own RESP

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,770
in version with all software it's called

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,590
Suzie bian and it's built automatically

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:08,300
and you can put it on the SD card and in

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:10,460
trance then the device so I think a

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,870
challenge here is that a lot of people

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,210
in the community they have knowledge

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,310
about software but our experience is

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,130
also that not everything can be solved

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:21,050
with software only for example and

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,780
there's always the question of the hot

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,600
words here so hot were to activate a

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,150
device and our experience is like if you

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,920
have a very good microphone and then it

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,990
works much better than let's say with a

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,570
cheap microphone but of course the goal

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,500
is to keep the price of the hardware

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:43,760
that is needed to build in open-source

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:47,510
assistant below $100 yeah or 100 euros

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,300
so so this is a challenge that we are

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,220
facing and yeah we are continuing the

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,340
conversation with hardware developers

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,070
here and if anyone has any knowledge

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,720
we're happy to to learn from them how

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,720
they solve these challenges

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:16,289
watch me share and Mario dimension and

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,299
something that another thing that we

00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,600
only implement we have the Android and

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,580
iOS client for for Suzy so you can

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,549
actually download the app on the App

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,320
Store and try to to test our associated

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:31,169
test the system

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,740
another thing we also have a web client

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:38,220
so on on a web player and it also ready

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,529
is Bill with the reactor is and its

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,470
support of suppose most of the action

00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:46,019
types including what Mario mentioned

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,539
earlier images audio video map table

00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:55,049
checks and yeah we also want to

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:58,679
encourage more user to join our in test

00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:03,539
the existing action types that available

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,210
of them and another thing that we

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,000
already implemented we have another

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:12,630
desktop client using the electron

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,320
framework why do we you electronic work

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:21,090
is allows the development of nest of

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,500
kill application using components

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,720
originally developed from the web and

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,289
there's something that we really happy

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,740
about and also very proud of the skills

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:39,330
CMS so what is a skills a skill is a

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:44,269
draw or SAP accrual that produce in so

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:46,980
for for question yeah if you have

00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,500
experience in building skill with Alexa

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,289
you will see that our skills in F look

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:57,269
very similar is have a good interface

00:23:52,289 --> 00:24:00,899
and also very easy to use why is it easy

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:03,450
to use in other services in order to

00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:06,029
write ask you or artillery a is a true

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,190
asset approved you need to know a

00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:11,760
pacific set or program programming

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,799
language before suzy we don't have to it

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,830
doesn't matter with revering language

00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:20,720
that you use we invented something

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,270
called the language of truth with very

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,170
simple and easy like the weekly style so

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:29,300
you can really scale within a few

00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:37,310
minutes instead of you have to go back

00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:39,860
and learn Java or Python we also saw the

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,310
core of the Susy come from Susy a iced

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,720
over

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,720
I think we share later on you can

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,680
explain a little bit about the language

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:53,060
of thoughts how do you in the beginning

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:57,350
yeah so see silver provide output in the

00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:00,290
JSON file yeah is it yes so this is a

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,840
complete picture of the infrastructure

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,060
of the of the project so we have suze

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,150
server in the middle and then the

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,530
control console service system component

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,290
and different clients that being

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,510
implemented already beside what I

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,270
mentioned already the Android app iOS

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:21,470
web app desktop application we also

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:25,370
build many extension for the browser so

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:29,690
it's available on the drome drome iam

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,780
Firefox and we also be one extension for

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:35,360
the magic mirror project if any of you

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,100
familiar with that project so the magic

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,180
mirror you stay in front of major and it

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:45,160
will tell you your personal profile and

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:49,730
your interest and we also implement many

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,370
multiple messenger boss for services

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,010
like Facebook like get survivors slack

00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:01,130
and telegram and the community continue

00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:03,190
to a more messenger post on this too

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,980
yeah

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:11,150
what is the technology stack behind see

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,850
so I think yes so we share the Suzie's

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,650
over what is the technology people who

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,360
understand that people interested to

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,740
view the client but they always come in

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:26,180
other question about the server

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:28,310
how does Susie run in the back so Susie

00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,980
server is implemented in Java software

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:35,240
it's a sum of it accepts we

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:38,990
first containing the string that person

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,059
the user has spoken or typed in and it

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,400
responds with a JSON object so it's

00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,460
actually really easy

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,460
the it doesn't mean that you have to

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,130
program in Java if you want to make a

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,630
skill and some folks set the language of

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,100
thought is really easy and it's really

00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:01,340
it's understandable it's not programming

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:03,230
but you don't know you don't need to

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,929
know something about the server if you

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:10,780
want to use the scales or program scales

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,780
so this is just the typical Java stack

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:22,280
yeah this is like a normal food stack

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:28,179
application so the front-end is

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,179
implemented in in HTML and we are using

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:38,900
yeah we did the Java for that is not a

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,650
travel HTML front and is in the

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:46,220
application front-end and in the web

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,830
font and so Android is native Java or

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,650
code Lin and this is just this is just a

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:56,030
normal technology so interestingly we

00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:59,179
don't know so much about the background

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,970
information how other smart speakers are

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:06,500
implemented so there's nothing where we

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,870
can copy some behavior from and this is

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:13,130
very similar to the other search engine

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:15,950
projects that I made before so it's a

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:20,350
lot of things are search engine related

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:24,470
like scraping a search result from

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:31,280
YouTube to get a list of possible movies

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:33,559
that we can play as music yeah

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,130
is this another component which we need

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:39,320
in the smart speaker so we don't we we

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,330
always need the answer from the zeusie

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,640
server back-end to have some intelligent

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,310
to answer some knowledge inside but to

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,770
get there in a device like this refers

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:52,270
to have to do speech protect the text

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:55,750
and after we get an answer we must do

00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:58,280
text-to-speech so right now we are using

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,840
the best opportunities from a technology

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:05,480
standpoint which we get which is Google

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,180
speech to text and text-to-speech of

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,570
course this project is also about

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,250
privacy so actually we shouldn't do this

00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,610
but this isn't in the intermediate step

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:20,570
until we have something which can run on

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,600
the device itself which we would be

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:26,150
happy to use so they are there is a

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,490
software like pockets things to do

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,390
speech to text but it's not working so

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,610
we're and it's not good for

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,100
demonstration it's implemented in our

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:38,720
client but we are not using it for

00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:41,780
demonstration I think this is an

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,450
important point but architecture wise we

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,180
discussed this point several times and

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,610
so the implementation is done in a way

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,090
that we can switch between different

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:57,680
voice recognition services or solutions

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:59,270
so once we have enough data or better

00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,400
service we can just switch to it

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,070
immediately and it's not always about

00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,870
the software it's also about the data

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:09,220
for example CMU's things or other

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:13,310
projects the question is do you have

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,830
like a good language set in this

00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:18,230
software solution and we had companies

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:23,000
and projects that asked us for example

00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:25,040
to collaborate on this and develop new

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,270
implementations for new languages so

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,990
that's something that we could also

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,820
collaborate with other projects and once

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,240
we are we have a device which can

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,890
operate or completely offline we will

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,190
get more much more applications possible

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:42,860
like like in security environments like

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:45,260
like in medical applications or other

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,000
applications where you shouldn't be

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,890
dependent from other systems and should

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,390
people to complete an independent is

00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:55,160
also a very big privacy thing

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:58,250
so yeah I find this point what you just

00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,880
mentioned with the offline very very

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,380
important yeah because okay once we have

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,260
many people in Asia they don't always

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,300
have like a good access to the Internet

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,860
and actually it's also the case in

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,820
Germany that not everyone has always

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:16,070
good access to the Internet and but like

00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:21,380
also from the privacy standpoint I mean

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:24,440
why should I contact or like why should

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:27,860
I ask my cloud service to switch on my

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,230
local music player and play my private

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,910
music library why do I have to connect

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,510
to the cloud to do that I don't have to

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,820
do that so one thing that we are working

00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,950
on is like only connect to the cloud if

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,720
you really need it and secondly if

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,230
you're not connected to the Internet

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,830
then like try to support as much as

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:52,190
possible offline so even if people say

00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,200
oh I want the the awesome voice online

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,990
from this service or when it's offline

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,300
it could still maybe have like the the

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,520
basic basic voice or something like that

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,470
implementation could have basic services

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,450
so this is really an important goal in

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,059
this project that as much as possible

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,980
should work offline and people who don't

00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,080
want to share their data with cloud

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,910
services they they don't have to share

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,570
their data or they don't have to share

00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,580
any account information or they trust a

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:29,090
service and and this service could

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:31,580
delete the data potentially okay so I

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,980
would like to go back to what we

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:42,280
mentioned earlier the language or

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:42,280
thought how to Mexico with Susy skew CMS

00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:52,480
okay so basically this is an interface

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:54,890
of skill and they're only a lot of

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,000
skilled written by the community

00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:01,730
available on the website if you want

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,970
your just to inspect some of the action

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:08,170
type you can just go there and

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:11,540
look at the website and then we're gonna

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:15,290
do not lady demo we're gonna show you

00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:21,050
quickly how to how you can create a

00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:25,640
skill okay so before you before you

00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:29,770
really for people who don't have a

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:32,300
knowledge in this yet and who want to

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:37,210
try out themselves so we implement

00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:41,950
something called its blend and analyze

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:49,700
and this is got we got inspired by the

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:54,830
was were Siri I think the people aware

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:58,040
of you seen this theory right yeah raise

00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:01,970
your hand if you have seen this okay so

00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:09,200
most of you so we don't have to display

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:13,760
ended okay so so basically and the and

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,860
Ally is a debugging system when let's

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,530
say a robot or a personal assistant

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,960
gives you the answer that you asked us a

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,180
question we're actually the answer come

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,480
from so this is what have happened in

00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,930
West Grove and we implement the similar

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,610
thing

00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,860
so when you get the answer that you are

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,140
not happy with or you're curious where

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,900
Susie give you this answer you can type

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,560
in its plan and would give you the

00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:41,480
answer of with later in which I know how

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,440
come they provide you the answer and I

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,140
think that's something this is something

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,720
that really cool so you can inspect play

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:51,610
different components and different code

00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,600
that come count that make up this skill

00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:58,510
so at the moment I think that what you

00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:03,500
can type explain and in Lystra yeah

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:05,450
and add the the another layer is after

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,400
they give you this plan of the skill you

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,920
ask again the same question so it's

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,710
blend again what is that review skills

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:19,030
come from how far can it go on have you

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,030
tried okay

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,920
so it will explain where the explained

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,010
skill is actually stored and so people

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,740
can analyze this expense kill and

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:33,170
individual interface you will have a

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,000
link so I think it's also like we talked

00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,070
a lot about voice but actually and this

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,290
is already something that is different

00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:44,540
to Alexa and and Google and there is no

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:47,450
Alex of chat where you can chat with

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,190
Alexis to a UI but for us like it

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,050
doesn't matter like the output from the

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,370
server is a JSON file and whatever

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:58,160
client you implement it can work so here

00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:05,300
it's it's a visual client but you could

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:16,250
also have an audio only client okay so

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:19,790
this is yeah and then how can you will

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:22,100
be a skill so just to repeat a bit again

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:27,410
a skill is to draw drew says that

00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:31,910
produce answer to question very simple

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,860
so if you go to chapter zhu zai and on

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:38,570
the right hand side on the left hand

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:42,710
side you click on the burger and then it

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,090
will show skill you need to login you

00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,150
need to create an account in order to

00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:52,490
two reals q and so as i mentioned before

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,070
if you look at alexa seri container or

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:58,310
google now you need to have the

00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,990
knowledge either Java Python or C++ in

00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:05,690
order to write ask you but you don't

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:08,330
need that for for Susie AI quick we have

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,550
prepared a few example for you we're

00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,900
gonna be seen now the fourth example for

00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,310
something very simple and easy which is

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:18,230
fix Curie in Enzo so basically if you

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,600
run a business and which you just want

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,480
to race some kind of a Sidon assistant

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:27,410
that stay that have a funny conversation

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,350
with your user you see on the ball roses

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,670
are red Suzie is a hack you can try so

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,290
one ends

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,970
once the first sense then either the

00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,760
question in the second sense and is the

00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,770
answer which is to both houses they

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,930
respond back to the user and you can go

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,270
on go only if you have time you can sit

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,309
down in Rio light house and lie of

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,260
question and answer just to create

00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:50,390
something funny and this is being done I

00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:54,040
think also in Alex I would many school

00:37:50,390 --> 00:38:00,740
so fix a question and answer and another

00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:06,440
type of school which is random answer in

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,900
question so you can define random and so

00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,180
focus if ik question in this case what

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,520
is your favorite dish and you can

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:18,710
identify what do you want Susie to

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,780
answer in the system and it also reverse

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,420
on the other way so you can provide one

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,210
answer for a different question that

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,200
being asked by the user so in order to

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:33,530
to to make it's close to the effective

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:40,390
output the more question that you create

00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:40,390
here the closer it's get to the answer

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:51,890
why cuz this is the pattern you want to

00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:54,770
continue with the pattern so now I have

00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:57,200
seen two simple examples after Susie

00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:00,079
schooling which which it looks like

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,299
simply text now it gets more into more

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,450
details which look more like programming

00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,859
so what we what we did is a language

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:08,299
which is so simple that you actually

00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:11,210
don't think this is a programming

00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:14,180
language it's like we wanted to have a

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,700
disruptive situations like when the

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:19,280
wikipedia came it was easy to write

00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:22,579
content because you're just by text and

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,990
before Wikipedia you had to if you

00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,819
wanted to make a web page who maybe

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,940
wanted to make content you have to write

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:32,089
HTML which is not for everyone so this

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,309
is the same with our skilling but you're

00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:36,650
not doing programming anymore you're

00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:39,290
just writing down two sentences and it

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,839
you have seen only the most simple

00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:45,050
examples no it gets more complex so the

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:50,960
the star is just a placeholder

00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:53,540
can put in anything next so more

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,540
examples we can use this and you can

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,930
fill in the content which had matched

00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:02,930
with the star and use it in the sentence

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,300
again so this is basically what was also

00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,870
invented the relies more than thirty

00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,260
years ago

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,880
so not really sophisticated but that's

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:16,970
the beginning of the story

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:20,480
next you can have some you can trigger

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,920
some memories so if you use this crater

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,980
symbol you can store it in a variable

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,920
and use the content of the variable

00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:31,540
afterwards so of zeusie is able to have

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:35,990
a memory of what was in the chat history

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:43,580
next yeah this is an example where I can

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:45,500
use random answers for getting the

00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,060
result from something called function

00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,040
color it's not actually a function

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,010
definition but it's just a helper method

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,650
which explains what's reflection in

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,920
Suzie Suzie can use a Suzie scale to

00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:02,030
fill in some part of its answer and in

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,400
this case Suzie is trying to find color

00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,050
which it likes and if you ask it the

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,300
first time it takes a random color and

00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,490
if you ask it a second time it remembers

00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,990
what it took before and prints out the

00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:17,050
same thing so in the second intent you

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:20,240
see here what is your favorite color it

00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:22,610
deciders is the color set then it prints

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,630
out my favorite color is the color which

00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:29,000
you set or if it's not set it's it's

00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,730
saying I like and then the reflection

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,100
takes part function color and it's

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:42,920
stored in the variable so it remembers

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:46,680
this the next time yeah so if you want

00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,260
to have been embed JavaScript you can

00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,910
use that bank symbol to have some

00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,480
scripting inside we are planning to do

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:57,690
more scripting languages inside most

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,740
interestingly like Prolog or other

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:05,850
languages which are popular next and

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,770
this is this is finally what is most

00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,260
important to get information from other

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,870
web pages so if you want to have content

00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,360
from another web page like a sports page

00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:18,030
and you could discover that this page

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,760
has a JSON API and to get information

00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:23,550
from the JSON API you can use their JSON

00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,650
API so the most simple thing is to

00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,470
mention only two things from that

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,920
external API on that that it's the URL

00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:34,350
itself and the another thing is the JSON

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,080
path so that's a declaration you do with

00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:40,920
that so-called console rule it's using

00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,990
one UI and the path to the JSON object

00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,870
which is called articles and articles

00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:49,800
you find the search result list and the

00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:54,560
first hit is then given in the answer

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:57,750
line which is the title and you are so

00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,870
the results list are very important in

00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,730
in in zeusie because using backtracking

00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,890
and that's a concept from logical

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:08,070
programming using backtracking we could

00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:18,300
use alternative answers so Suzie is able

00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:21,330
to think about possible results how to

00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:26,640
create a private Susi chat board and

00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:32,310
this is something very simple again you

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:35,910
do the same interface to go to chance to

00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:38,520
see that AI and instead of free a SKU

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:47,600
you can create a chat board and you can

00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:51,660
easily follow the four step of how to

00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:55,710
create a tripod and enter it into your

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,330
own website I think the interesting

00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,559
thing for chat bot so what is the

00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:03,999
difference between a chat bot and a

00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,189
skill so a chatbot is a private is a

00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:08,769
private skill basically yeah

00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:11,709
and originally we had the idea to make

00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:13,569
everything open yeah oh let's make

00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:15,339
people like open source as much as

00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:18,699
possible but there are maybe private

00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:23,769
api's or keys that people use to access

00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:24,609
web services and that is a reason why

00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:26,529
yeah

00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:29,170
chat pod could be good and also you can

00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:32,469
embed it on your website so you can

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:34,869
click on javascript code for example and

00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:37,869
yeah go through it maybe yeah let's go

00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:41,049
through the types ok so so for example

00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:43,779
here is also another interesting feature

00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:47,019
if you have a chat bot then you want

00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:49,420
your chat bot to look like maybe like a

00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:51,579
website or like a favorite design so you

00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:54,339
could for example at a picture or change

00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:57,699
the color and at your own little I can

00:44:54,339 --> 00:45:00,729
or your own picture for the answers so

00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:04,119
all that is possible here and yeah there

00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:06,489
is a small I can they up there when you

00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:10,170
can try it out so you can switch to a

00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:13,299
view visual a visual view or code view

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:17,349
so both this possible just like in HTML

00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:19,599
then they are the next step is that we

00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:22,479
are adding options for example limit a

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,719
chatbot only to a certain website or to

00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:28,539
number of certain websites and we

00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:31,089
include Suzy AI skills so they're many

00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:32,979
default skills in Suzy AI if you don't

00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:36,579
want them if you want the chat bot only

00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:38,859
communicates what you tell Susie I in

00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:41,769
your skill and then you can limit that

00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:43,799
as well and yeah of course there are

00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:47,019
many more features that we could imagine

00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:51,279
and yeah in the final step you simply

00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:53,650
copy a small piece of code and put it in

00:45:51,279 --> 00:46:01,479
your HTML page and then you'll have

00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:04,660
Susie I on your own website how to be

00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:08,349
overseas mass speaker I think that we

00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,359
run in now of time and I think we share

00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,030
audio explained in the beginning yeah

00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:28,930
how we view a speaker

00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:33,700
we sort of do we still have time for yes

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:36,490
so if you want to get involved and want

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:39,100
