Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning has become ubiquitous in many daily activities, with the Global Positioning System (GPS) being the most common source of signals. Having analyzed earlier the reception and decoding of such signals, we now address the issue of signal spoofing, and develop some of the requirements on the emitted signal power and stability to efficiently spoof single frequency GPS receivers, whether in mobile phones, cars or UAV. Initially designed as a military positioning system (NAVSTAR &amp; GLONASS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) in particular have become ubiquitous to mostly everyone's life. Before being a localization system through triangulation of the signals received from the satellite constellation, GNSS is based on time transfer. As such, it is used in multiple industrial applications requiring time-synchronization, whether for communication (mobile phone basestations), trading (stock exchange), or distributed sensor timestamping: a British study [1] estimates at 1 billion pounds (aka euros) per day the cost of GNSS disruption (jamming), not to mention the impact of spoofing in which the user might not even be aware that a false signal is being received. While GNSS spoofing, requiring multi-MHz bandwidth around a carrier frequency of 1575.42 MHz, used to be restricted to well funded organizations, the advent of Software Defined Radio (SDR) emitters opens the opportunity for any motivated developer to create a spoofing device. We here demonstrate the use of Analog Device's PlutoSDR for such a purpose, the need for an accurate local oscillator, the impact of the local oscillator frequency on the short term (phase noise) and long term (Allan deviation) frequency stability of the output signal, the capability to move mobile phones, cars and even high grade (UBlox) receivers to any location assuming a few conditions are met (emitting signals mimicking the same satellites as those seen at a given time by the receiver, meaning not too far in space or time with respect to the real signal). Finally, we demonstrate shifting the timing output of high-grade receivers (1 PPS) by introducing erroneous time offsets in the messages transmitted by the spoofing signal. We conclude with mitigation strategies, excluding multi-constellations approaches which are only a matter of better spoofing capability, but focusing on physical signal characteristics hardly spoofed from a single ground based emitter.

okay okay thanks for attending the

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,039
presentation about GPS poofing so

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,200
actually when I submitted the talk I

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,060
knew we could spoof GPS but I didn't

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,340
know whether we could detect GPS

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,470
spoofing so there is a sequel to a

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,130
presentation which is GPS proofing

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,129
detection but it just worked on Monday

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,050
so it's quite fresh so we're doing this

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,870
work with Glen who's over there he's

00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,250
gonna run the demo while I'm talking and

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,990
my colleague from the business

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,700
observatory we're doing this for fun and

00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,230
actually we're being paid for doing this

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,360
for friend this is a project funded by

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,190
the French national research agency and

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,230
that's a nice thing with University you

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,540
get paid to have fun so it's what we're

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,480
doing here so just a quick reminder what

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,970
is GPS GPS starters as the Navstar

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,020
project of course DARPA project start in

00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,000
1973 satellite started launching in 1978

00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,570
and I don't think there's been much

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,440
public exposure as initially it was

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,570
mostly military service until Bill

00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,030
Clinton removed selective availability

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,549
or decided to have selective

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,590
availability removed in 2000 and then

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,229
the resolution dropped from 45 meters

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,720
more or less to set five years and then

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,960
your GPS becomes usable so I think this

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,180
is when GPS has become a bit reduced to

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,060
most of our daily activities from

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,189
getting to the right place to do

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,820
locating multiple activities on our

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,640
mobile phones the basic principle and

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,909
this will be the core topic of my the

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,080
core discussion of my presentation is

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,200
that GPS is basically a set of

00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,030
spaceborne

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,430
atomic clocks they generate high

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,490
stability reference signal if you were

00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,930
here in 2015 are presented how to

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,670
synchronize oscillators and how to use

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,890
data from from GPS to collect using SDR

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,140
the GPS signals and you use

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,939
trilateration which is means you look at

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,690
the time of flight of a signal from all

00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:16,370
these satellites in space and by looking

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,080
at the intersection of a hyperbola you

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,860
end up finding where your look

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,530
the earth now this was all pretty fancy

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,710
for common public until software-defined

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,780
radio grew impressively and not only can

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,130
you now receive the signals button you

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,900
can also synthetize signals so we're

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,510
going to run the demo on the precise dr

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,240
and now there is GPS proofing has become

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,890
a 700 euro activity of course Germany

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,570
has no interest I mean jamming is just

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,780
sending a powerful signal spoofing is

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,970
much more interesting so why are we paid

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,700
to work on this it's not the most

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,780
attractive reason but that's what

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,270
actually the people who are paying for

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,000
it one of the reason people are

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,670
interested in simple is using GPS is how

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,520
do you synchronize clocks located

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,959
different places in space one of the

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,810
people who are interested in this is

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,810
traders when you have trading centers

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,370
where did you buy the share first is it

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,100
in New York and frankfurter in Paris

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,240
these people they want to know

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,520
accurately the timing other transactions

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,870
so if you look at this paper here it's

00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,550
from a New York time so it's a general

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,070
public journal you can trust or not

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,500
trust the content but if you it just

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,959
illustrates why we're working on this

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,209
there is a new regulation that says that

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,890
all trade financial institution to

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,769
synchronize time stamp trades with

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,730
microsecond accuracy now remember light

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,660
travels 300 meter per microsecond

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,360
Frankfurt is more than Finneran meter

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,670
from Paris so how do you synchronize two

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,459
clocks in Paris and Frankfurt when they

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,230
are more than three meter way and well

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,519
what will say here is Google would later

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,950
use these methods to synchronize

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,750
computer based on GPS data thank you

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,140
google so people have been doing this

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,510
for like 20 30 years now but GPS is

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,630
accepted as one of the usual means of

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,660
synchronizing spatially distributed data

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,040
so my talk here is can you trust the

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,830
time that you distribute with with GPS

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,440
so just as a quick very brief summary of

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,510
what GPS looks like GPS is actually a

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,299
constellation of satellites or atomic

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,570
clocks rubidium clocks and hydrogen

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:26,720
maser embedded on space vehicles and

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,210
these atomic clocks send a code at one

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,849
megabit per second which you receive on

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,509
on ground

00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:38,539
by using by calculating the to arrange

00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,490
pseudo range defined as the time it took

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:42,710
for a signal to go from satellite

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,710
jae-joong to ground divided by the

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,960
velocity of light you get estimates of

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,490
by trial iteration of the position of

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,009
when you are in the ground

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,740
now this you're used to doing this real

00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,110
time but most professional users will be

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,319
post-processing their GPS data because

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,030
these space vehicle positions are

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,159
estimated when you send the navigation

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,539
data from the satellite they estimate

00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,520
for the next day where the satellite

00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,199
should be of course estimations has some

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,759
error and if you go for a sub-meter

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,650
positioning which is what you do for

00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,259
geodetic analysis whatever geophysical

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,509
measurements well you need to get better

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,800
accuracy imagine you want to be located

00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,300
on the ground with submit your

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,370
resolution it means you need to know

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,319
where your space vehicle is we've submit

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,780
a resolution and this you usually do

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,060
with post-processing so what you can

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,620
find on the Internet is a set of files

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,659
that will not only give you the

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,340
estimates of a satellite in the future

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,469
but also that past measurements these

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,810
are closed or perform at for sharing

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:41,270
these data our very next files this will

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,240
be our input data we will be able to

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,449
spoof TPS by using the read x-files and

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,409
generate a virtual constellation of data

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:54,229
based on this data so you get these

00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:57,289
really x-files of the observation of the

00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:00,169
navigation data of the satellites and by

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:04,699
doing this you can collect where every

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:06,229
satellite should be so what will be our

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,650
spoofing techniques popping technique

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,090
will be the Pluto I see our GPS is one

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,159
megabit per second so you need a two

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,050
megahertz bandwidth Pluto ser has more

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,759
than two megahertz bandwidth so perfect

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,169
we can generate the data on the two to

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,520
STR we did try to embed the software

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,120
that we're using which is the excellent

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,430
software here Pluto GPS sim on the zinc

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,840
of a Kutaisi are I think Ivor this

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,759
software was not optimized enough

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,349
because it's very readable but if it's

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,620
readable it's not necessary very

00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:39,199
optimized so we did try to embed the

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,880
software on the zinc you'd get this

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,620
confused data stream so you still need

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,969
at the moment we still need to run this

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,639
on the PC and

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,379
to stream IQ coefficients to laputa yzr

00:06:46,639 --> 00:07:13,849
which is what Gwen is doing at the

00:06:48,379 --> 00:07:15,349
moment we are all into the sea now I

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,479
just want to move his room into the sea

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:20,479
so if you do a quick calculation here

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,519
the standard of GPS definition of GPS

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,079
published by the US Air Force say it sat

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,059
on a receiver you should have something

00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:30,829
like minus 142 DBM let's take a 6 DB

00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:33,409
safety range so it means that if we

00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:36,769
transmit minus 40 DB n because the PTR

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,449
is designed to power 0 DBM ejectives on

00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:43,389
the carrier and because you spread the

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:45,979
spectrum over one second

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:48,679
30 DB so that's just your spectrum

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,839
spreading over over one megahertz and

00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:52,539
because we're spreading the spectrum we

00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,209
have transmitted power of minus 30 DBM

00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:58,969
free space propagation loss at one point

00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:00,919
57 gigahertz is this equation and if you

00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,759
do the maths you end that finding that

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,709
if you emit 0 DBM your range of your

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,519
your spoofing range is 800 meters just

00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,839
to give you a range

00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,039
you're not going to attack a whole

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,919
country by doing this you're just going

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,439
to attack local area here is powering

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,839
with minus 20 DBM so we drop the power

00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,639
we have a range free space range about

00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,860
80 meter this we checked on our parking

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,959
lot it matches we were more as a 50

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,449
meter when we attacked so just to tell

00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,860
you that we try to be knowledgeable

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,149
about what we're doing here it's not

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,740
just same power everywhere ok so some

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,449
some of you might has anyone been

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,149
spoofed room yeah good

00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:41,719
it's working very well good so you see

00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:44,089
here that so we move most of you in the

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,160
sea so what gwendy just before coming

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,660
here he collected on the internet the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
current through next file that gives you

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,880
that in the last hour the measured

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,230
position of satellites and in your in

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
this case this is what we did in the lab

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,329
you see here one samsung mobile phone

00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,889
that was not too

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,079
it was stealing doesn't zoom in stuff

00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:03,480
friends 47 degree north and in this

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,489
example which was self of friends 42

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,619
degree nerves to two of mobile phone one

00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:10,649
Sony one Sam Soon where self of friends

00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:12,779
one was saying business on God networks

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,220
well that works most of the time it

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,019
works very well with mobile phones and

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,850
as I can see all these hands raised in

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:23,100
the room however does it work on UAVs so

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,049
all these little drones but that was a

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,480
virtual bang for a few hundred euro so

00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:29,670
on DJI drones you have these u-blox

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,850
receivers u-blox is a swiss company

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:35,999
selling I would say high-grade low-cost

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,230
GPS receivers and the nice thing with

00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,209
you blocks is when you're looking on

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,679
your mobile phone well you get spoofed

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,480
but you don't know what happened what is

00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,129
the quantity that might have protected

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,899
the spoofing what's nice with the you

00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:48,809
blocks is that you got the raw data so

00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,670
you blocks will give you the total range

00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,319
they will give you the Doppler shift and

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,199
they will give you some indicator

00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:57,569
spoofing and jamming indicator so you

00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,279
run this in the proprietary you Blood

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:02,910
Center software which runs on the wine

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,790
and if you have an accurate source so

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,799
what we did here is the clock that's

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,040
provided with a boot yzr is a 40

00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,869
megahertz temperature the temperature

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,459
compensated crystal oscillator I'll show

00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:18,929
you a bit later but it can be off by a

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:20,879
few ppm so not only clock will never be

00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:23,309
out by a few ppm by a few ppb at most

00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,730
part of a billion so what we did here is

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:28,949
we remove the quartz from the Pluto SDR

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,689
and we fed it with a hydrogen maser so

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:32,759
basically a very high stability clock

00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:34,649
and if you see here that we clock the

00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,169
p2i gr with a hydrogen major control

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,850
source well we get nice Doppler shifts

00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,999
if you do the calculation if you do the

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,610
maths you will find out that due to the

00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:47,249
orbit of a GP of a GPS satellite you

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,769
define the period 12 hours and if you

00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:52,259
know the velocity of the satellite which

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,720
is the radius of sorry the circumference

00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,329
of its orbit divided by the time and you

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,579
do the Doppler shift conversion from

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,259
velocity to Doppler you find that GPS

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,139
can never be offset by more than plus or

00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,240
minus 5/2 Hertz and here it matches 2

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,939
kilohertz freakiest minus 1 kilohertz

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,810
so you see all green with spoofed u-blox

00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,779
receivers how

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,810
if we offset on purpose by 200 Hertz our

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,090
40 megahertz synthetizer you see that

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,310
the dopplers become unrealistic we have

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,620
10 kilohertz physically it's impossible

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,279
to have a GPS offset by 10 kilohertz so

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,250
indeed the u-blox has identified that

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,200
some of these satellite signals are not

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,810
genuine because there is a spoofing

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,610
indicator well maybe it's my mistake not

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,860
to have activated all the security

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,540
facilities of all the you blocks but at

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,310
least this one was to giving us position

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,610
the wrong position it knew it was wrong

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,880
which was still giving the position so

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,410
what can we do to improve this well not

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,710
everyone has a hydrogen measure at home

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:56,050
and we wanted to spoof cars and cars

00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:59,140
were resistant so I believe that cars do

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,839
have this kind of spoofing capability

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,200
protection so what we wanted to do here

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,880
is to try to well first of all we try we

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,170
tested that indeed the reason why car

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,720
were not easily spoofed

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,120
was because of our excessive frequency

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,490
offset between local oscillator and

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,320
expected oscillator so we did the attack

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,870
with our hydrogen measure controlled

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,610
local oscillator and indeed the car

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,800
locating business on east of friend's

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,320
head where wheels in the sea somewhere

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,420
near Brittany so that worked so it is

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,470
indeed the problem is local oscillator

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,790
so you might have seen me setting up

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,520
temperature control crystals later so

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:40,360
that's a no 600 C so you can buy them

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,910
400 euro on on eBay this particular one

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,220
was salvaged from a broken frequency

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,140
counter so you go at your university you

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,370
look at the trash you find all frequency

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,050
counters you'll attack our frequency

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,300
counter Julie Packer is obviously the

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,400
best oscillator manufacturer so you get

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,620
one of these old synthesizers you they

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,450
take the oil sheiks off and you see here

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,580
it's a 25 24 volt 500 milli amp oven

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,110
voltage supply and 12 volt negligible

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,880
current to run the oscillator so

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,470
basically this runs on battery and means

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,330
you have a mobile attack you don't need

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,080
to stay in the lab as I'm demonstrating

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,130
here so what is the consequence actually

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,990
because I'm coming from a laboratory

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,450
dedicated to time frequency so what is

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,959
the consequence of replacing value of a

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,700
crystal oscillator what is the

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,990
consequence just to introduce to you

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,310
little bits and then I will go to a

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,800
detection 91 so what is the consequence

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,940
of off replacing the oscillator I'm

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
putting this graph here because I

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,020
haven't seen these on any of analog

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,500
devices datasheet or any information so

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,020
this is the stability of a temperature

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,820
control crystal oscillator so you see

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,490
here for three days

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,710
the crystals later was running you are

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,150
sold a 40 million hearts oscillator but

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,340
the crystal oscillator a temperature

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,830
compensated crystal oscillator is only

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,300
passively compensated meaning if the

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,340
room temperature changes well it will

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,680
shift it a little bit you see here it's

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,600
moving by plus minus 10 Hertz it might

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,090
not sound much 10 Hertz over 40

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,560
megahertz is not not much well that's

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,870
about 8 5 22 minus 8 that's awful for an

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,000
oscillator I mean 4 o'clock with if you

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,490
say that GPS is made of atomic clocks

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,170
that's infinite so what we did here is

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,750
replace it with the o CH so which is a

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,120
blue line here since you have a 1 pixel

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,190
wide blue line what I did is I magnify

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,690
the blue line into this one here notice

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,090
that there is a thousand full-scale

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,430
increase from this scale for vertices so

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,470
to do six also what we did by replacing

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,000
the t6o with the o CH so the temp of

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,060
temperature control with oven control

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,460
crystal oscillator is we improved for

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,980
order of magnitude stability

00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,110
so you see here we go from about few 10

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,450
to the minus a to few Tom 10 to minus 14

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,580
that's a very good should pack our dose

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,740
later and that explains to you why now

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,720
it's working however is the trade off

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,130
this is the long term stability but

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,450
there is another parameter that we are

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,340
very much obsessed in especially for

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,720
radar application and that's shorter and

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,690
stability so when you think of short

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,150
term sub-second stability you generally

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,890
don't think about time but frequency the

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,080
inverse of time so if you look at phase

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,660
noise phase noise is how much your

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,660
oscillator fluctuates in a given well

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,610
rate which is inverse of time and what I

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,190
find interesting is that this is the

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,890
curve the black curve here is the onla

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,980
on board rock on 40 megahertz physics so

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,840
provided by analog devices and you see

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,240
that envelope on the long or short on

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,030
the short term so large frequency large

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,860
or self offset frequency we have

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,270
excellent stability if I really choose a

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,050
very good oscillator

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,000
how

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,550
well it's only a t6o so when you go

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,680
ahead at longer duration so frequency

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,600
closer to the carrier that's ten

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,310
millisecond 100 millisecond one second

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,440
from the carrier you see that of course

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,110
it diverges well it's a TC so it moves

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,240
with temperature with the OC so we've

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,029
solved the problem but what you see here

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,010
is that if you so the Pluto ser you can

00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,140
find on the analog website you can you

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,730
don't need to clock in 40 megahertz and

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,829
actually most OC EXO will be 10

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,600
megahertz a standard 10 megahertz so

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,940
what I did here is I had configured or

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,670
we configure live when the local

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,410
oscillator to be 10 20 30 40 megahertz

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,600
and what you see actually is where the

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,010
PLL of the Pluto SDR is really not

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,930
working very well at 10 megahertz

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,870
attending hours you have this is the

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,519
very good club but still the the PLL

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,649
internal to the to the Pluto SDR

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,450
exhibits a high phase now is 20 minutes

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,880
they'll be there and only above 30

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,670
megahertz can you get the expected phase

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,649
noise quality so what would be have what

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,290
would have been nice is to take the

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,870
osage so clock DDS to generate for 40

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,240
megahertz and feed the brutalize er with

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,370
a 40 megahertz locked on the OC so we

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,690
didn't have time to do this so just to

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,730
introduce to you what is a tours

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,370
Whitehead does it has a consequence now

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,529
if you think this is 10 DB what is 10 DB

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,660
why does the Pluto IDR care about 10 DB

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,220
remember that all these yellow best

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,410
movement and friends we're with you

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,740
forgot all these tribes and riots it's a

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,140
zero point a DB rise in oil price in

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,640
gasoline price so imagine how unhappy

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:20,559
perpetuity re is when it really

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:20,980
struggles and I crossed the time that is

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,870
a

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,299
Smita different trade centers using GPS

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:28,209
now my colleague from a year tells me

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:30,160
never ever tune an atomic clock an

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,350
atomic clock might drift a little bit

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,179
due to aging due to pressure change due

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,179
to environmental change but it's very

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:40,390
deterministic changes so you never ever

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,470
tune a an atomic clock you measure the

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,690
drift and when you measure the

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,910
visionaries you inform the user of this

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,320
drift but you don't try tuning vagotomy

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,350
Club so this is exactly what's wrong on

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,020
GPS on GPS the time offset between the

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,169
onboard atomic clocks and the ground

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,230
atomic clocks at the USNO are measured

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:01,750
and we don't tune the oscillators above

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,570
the satellite we just inform the user of

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,919
frequency offset linear drift and my

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,600
colleague Francois tells me that a

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,429
quadratic offset is actually always to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,320
zero so this is actually what you find

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,900
in the software on the spoofing software

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,740
you see indeed that the clock is a zero

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:21,000
plus time times AF 1 plus x times x so x

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:24,429
square x AF 2 plus for atavistic

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,650
correction plus a group delay so between

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,990
frequency 1 and frequency to the two

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,120
carriers of GPS so indeed and you have a

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,660
first derivative so you see that indeed

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
f0 f1 f2 determine the time and what you

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,830
can do here is you send this time in the

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,770
frames of the navigation navigation

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:44,230
frames of your GPS signal so what when

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,070
did here is so what when is going to

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,380
jail and not me so what you see here is

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,630
what we did is we introduced five ten to

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,630
the minus six so five microseconds in a

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,400
f0 offset here and indeed when you

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,500
measure over one PPS output of your you

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,320
block GPS you see that every two minutes

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,960
time is shifted by five microseconds so

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,030
you can spoof time using this now the

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,250
question was if you prove time do you

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,770
move in space well no because the whole

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,630
constellation is jumping over time so it

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,790
means that the relative position of a

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,500
satellite are still the same it's just

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,820
the time that has shifted so if you look

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,169
at the position that was sent by the

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,910
u-blox we haven't moved

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,410
if you move by 10 micro second you

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,000
expect to move like three kilometers

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,260
which is obviously not the case you see

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,450
that there is a little bit of junk here

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,690
but we obviously did not move by the

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:34,000
time introduced by the jump of the time

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,720
offset so that demonstrates to you wait

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,190
well I

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,799
wouldn't say it's an easy attack I don't

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,429
think it's a representative attacked in

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,010
real life

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,530
but I just wanted to make you think

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,270
about is search information reliable

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,260
it's been a long time the DARPA is no

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,780
longer relying on ground-based locating

00:19:50,260 --> 00:20:00,580
system but for civilian use this has

00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:01,900
huge so it does have implications in my

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:08,880
opinion about the trust we can have in

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:13,000
GPS now and this is where I have to okay

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,760
so now I would like to imagine what can

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,559
I do to detect spoofing again jamming is

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,179
stupid I mean you take a spectrum

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,650
analyzer you do you look at at your

00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:21,280
spectrum and you see jamming but that's

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,140
easy enough

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,549
how can you protect from spoofing we've

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,559
seen that there is a Doppler

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,299
well Doppler if you have a good enough

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,850
local oscillator you can simulate the

00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,039
plur there is power well power is again

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,360
you can tune power so that your receiver

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,100
believes that you know you're in the

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,809
right power range so I wouldn't consider

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,240
these anti-spoofing techniques as

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,400
reliable because you can adapt

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,559
someone powerful enough can adapt power

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
can adapt frequency I think that there

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,150
is one quantity that cannot be proved

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,090
and it's a fact that GPS is a

00:20:49,150 --> 00:21:01,809
constellation of subtler all over the

00:20:52,090 --> 00:21:04,539
sky buta Singh attack with all the

00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:06,610
spoofing antennas synchronized to serve

00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,520
microseconds which is a whole topic that

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,020
were discussing here so in my opinion

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:15,419
looking at the angle of arrival of a

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,260
signal is I cannot imagine of a way of

00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,240
countering with this kind of of

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,520
detection and of course if you look at

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,190
the precision of I Triple E a special

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,929
issue in 2016 about a GNSS sensitivity

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,419
to attacks you see that quite a few

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,700
offers were interested in multi antenna

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,740
arrays and detecting angle of arrival so

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,270
I will not go to use of the maps running

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,220
a bit out of time but just imagine that

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,750
if you have a source which is very far

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,970
away these are the conditions of our way

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,429
gps is more than six meter away from the

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,500
receiver of GPS satellites so far field

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,870
conditions are met and then you have

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500
between multiple antenna a phase offset

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,120
which is only dependent

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,520
as emit an elevation of your of your

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,230
antenna and this is an example of this

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,929
paper here which is cited in this paper

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,610
where the offers you might have seen

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,409
this it was a yacht

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,360
very we're trying to simulate how you

00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:04,940
could take your dinner in a wrong

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,100
position so they they spoof our GPS from

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,510
a one constellation which is a genuine

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,740
consolation and they move the you're in

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,630
the wrong place which is just what we

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,640
did a few minutes ago and what these

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,039
offers say say look at the face between

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,390
antennas they have joke all collapse in

00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,789
one value of course because your emitter

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,169
is located one place the power has

00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,880
jumped that's just because they didn't

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,120
tune their power well enough and the

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,470
Doppler shift has has has changed shade

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,539
well this article they don't have a good

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,970
looks later but in my opinion this is

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,409
really very important part now the

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,850
problem for me is when I read the paper

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,049
I just don't understand anything about

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,270
what they did I mean it's it they

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,120
demonstrated but they go into tuning

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:43,880
their PLL that locks on the on the local

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,080
on the face copy on the DLL I just

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,850
cannot understand so what I would like

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,140
to show you thanks to Paul boffins

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,659
presentations or the next presenters

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,390
presentation 2014 is well I think I

00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,520
devised a very simple means of detecting

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,440
and a very computationally efficient way

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,780
of doing this now what you I'm

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,780
demonstrating here is a b210 the d2 10

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,909
here is connected through BIOS t22 GPS

00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,190
antennas you see the two GPS antenna on

00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,169
the top floor of our laboratory here the

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,450
b210 is collecting the two data stream

00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:14,000
so I'm just saving on the computer over

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,280
over IQ coefficients now your usual way

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,100
of detecting GPS is to say let's plot

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,049
the Doppler shift for each satellite we

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,480
cross correlate the goal code for each

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,070
Doppler shift Doppler offset and if

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,659
there is the right doctor offset you see

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,400
the peak in the cross correlation which

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:30,980
tells you this satellite is visible bits

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,049
for acquisition phase of GPS and this is

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,520
on both antennas so both antennas are

00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,640
seeing the same satellites good are

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,419
facing the same place now what Paul told

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,830
us in 2014 is that your GPS signal is

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,570
proportional there's a magnitude we

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,549
don't care about it is called for

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,799
personal to the Doppler shift the dpsk

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,150
phase spectrum spreading and the

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,789
geometrical phase between the two

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,530
antennas now the problem the challenge

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,809
that was demonstrated by Paul is that or

00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,630
affirm echo is that because of spectrum

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:01,820
spreading your GPS signals below thermal

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,100
noise level at room temperature you

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,310
thermal noise on the bandwidth of two

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,800
megahertz is minus 111 DBM and your GPS

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:12,380
signal by the standards around 140 DB M

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,820
so you cannot detect keep yes just by

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,040
looking at a spectrum analyzer unless

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,500
you have refine radio telescope but he's

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,380
going to talk to us about now what Paul

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,050
told us is if you want to get rid of a

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,400
BPSK to collapse the spectrum all you

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,010
need to do is to square every signal

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,560
because by squaring the signal BPSK zero

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,390
PI phase so if you square the signal you

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,460
double your arguments and by doubling

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,980
your argument you have 0 to PI and 2 pi

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,990
equals 0 so you collapse the spectrum

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,390
and all this energy that is prayed over

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,120
2 megahertz is now concentrated in one

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,670
peak that has raised by 40 DB if you

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,800
raise by 30 DB a signal that is better

00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,780
than minus hundred 30 DBM you go above a

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,880
magnitude 11 DB and you can see your

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:58,820
signal actually enough if you do this

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,700
you get your peaks here with a frequency

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,670
offset which is given by Delta Omega the

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,190
frequency shift you've removed the BPSK

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:10,280
modulation and you're only left with the

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,650
geometrical phase if it's true well if I

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,830
now look at this flow graph where I'll

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,530
do this just to save space I run the

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,570
file source or USRP source I run this in

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,850
the multiply to square the data once

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,610
I've squared the data I've collapse the

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,800
spectrum and I can just plot this so

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,600
this is live live measurements on a be

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,630
210 so you see all your satellites here

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,450
and surely enough if I plot the phases

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:38,660
of the spoofing signal so you see this

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,060
is quite recent it was 34th January so

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,070
the spoofing signal all the phases of

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,260
all the satellites each column here is a

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,240
different sunlight they're all the same

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,500
that's not possible all the satellites

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,540
will not be located at the same place

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,220
now there's a bit of a question whether

00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,660
I might want to discuss with the guys of

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,250
features because I'm not really clear

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,660
why the faces change from one

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,450
acquisition to another but if you look

00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,070
inside one data set if I so these are

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,170
10-second measurements if I look from

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,400
the various chunks of data you have

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,990
always the same phase

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,850
somehow when I stop the Praetorian I

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,890
restarted five minutes later it was a

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,750
bit offset I don't yet exactly know why

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,760
and if you look at the genuine GPS

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,440
constellation or your satellites will

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,179
exhibit different

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,039
so meaning all the satellites are at

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,509
different locations so you see you have

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,279
a very efficient computationally

00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:24,620
efficient solution because you just have

00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,539
to square signal look at the face at the

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:30,830
abscissa of each one of your pigs and

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:32,480
you get the face of of your signal so as

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,279
a conclusion I want to show you that

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,779
spoofing gps is a good opportunity to

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,909
demonstrate detailed understanding of

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,740
gps signals it's really easy to

00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,440
implement on the Twitter I see are as

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,299
you can see here on the desk b210 SDR

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,519
can allow you to detect I don't claim to

00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:48,080
be doing a full GPS receiver as the guy

00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:49,879
from Genesis as you are doing in

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,590
Barcelona I just claimed to be very

00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:53,360
running a very stupid script very

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,580
computationally efficient script on the

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,009
b210 to measure direction of arrival and

00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,960
detect where we're from the signal is

00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,639
coming from and so I consider this as a

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,279
good dual approach either you can have

00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:08,149
the food GNSS SDR running on the b2 10

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:10,879
of on the IQ efficient or to have a real

00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:13,549
GPS receiver and my little approach here

00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,169
to today tech spoofing if you want to

00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,940
see a promotional video about what real

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,409
people can do about spoofing GPS if you

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,200
think this is just a toy and you have 40

00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,519
telling K euro to to spare you can see

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,809
what running fast is doing and they

00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,850
would prove anything all that you want

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,470
so I what I'm thinking here if you have

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,120
enough money what I'm sure here is

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,340
realistic and for the french-speaking

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,230
audience all this is detailed in the

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,029
current misc issue whose article is

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,559
translated on the false and webpages

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,909
over english-speaking audience the

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,889
article that's in there has been

00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,659
translated for you in to to to English

00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,549
so you can you can have a look at these

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,850
documents and with that I thank you for

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:45,850
attention
