The FLOSS movement is not just about convenience; our DNA includes a set of values that bring life to FLOSS. We’ve seen some of these values encoded in the infrastructure of the Internet and online life. We’ve also seen very troubling characteristics emerge online, where individuals and society face new and sometimes explosive risk. This talk explores how the FLOSS movement might reevaluate our values and seek to apply the lessons to our own projects and perhaps more broadly to online life as well. Today FLOSS software is everywhere.  In some ways the dream of 20 years ago has been realized.  FLOSS software is the norm, GitHub is mainstream.   The technology that dominates our era — the internet — is firmly based in FLOSS software, open standards, and interoperability.  These are victories, and we should celebrate them.  FLOSS was radical idea, and we proved its value. 

However, Internet life is increasingly run by a handful of organizations.  Many of these, like Facebook, google and amazon have FLOSS software at the core of they systems.  However, the layers on top are not FLOSS and there is little openness in the systems they create and run.   Today a common refrain is “the Internet is broken.  What can we do?” 

One part of the answer to this is to be found in FLOSS software.  That’s because FLOSS is not just a matter of convenience, of grabbing a library somewhere because it’s quick and efficient.  FLOSS is not something of the past.  FLOSS is not something settled, and comfortable and run of the mill. 

FLOSS is about freedom.  It’s about the choice of the individual to not accept what we are given, the freedom to branch off, to fork off and create something different. 
Floss software is not about wringing the very last cent of value out of a piece of software for the benefit of a small set of people.  FLOSS software is about creating value for everyone.
FLOSS software is about collaboration. 


We need all of these values in digital life today.  We don’t have them, just as we didn’t have them in desktop computing in the windows era.  We didn’t have them until FLOSSS made them real. Starting with developer tools and compilers and building to operating systems,systems, and then browsers and then all sorts of software.  We need that journey in digital life as well. 

It won’t be easy.  Facebook and Google and Amazon and Alibaba are powerful monopolies just as Microsoft was in the previous era.  It won’t be easy— there will be a period of building developer tool s and libraries before the FLOSS movement generates a raft of full fledged complex products.
 It may not be easy, but its worthwhile.  its’ beyond worthwhile — its critical.  And it can be wildly rewarding. 

FLOSS advocates and developers can not solve all the problems of digital life. But we can play an important role, a critical role.  The world needs technologists who show that a better way is possible.  We show a better ways possible by building a better way.  By building tools and libraries and products that give a meaningful choice.  Some will protect privacy, others will be algorithms and data sets that are transparent and verifiable.  Others you will dream up.  or perhaps you are working on them now. 

For many people today technology is becoming frightening.  the world is looking for technologists who with values, and technologies who actually live by their values.  The FLOSS world does this.  We have licenses that we don’t change whenever it’s convenient or might bring us more money than fame.  We live with them because we have decided as a community that our licenses reflect enduring values that are bigger than we are. 

We need FLOSS communities and projects in an every larger variety of the tech world.  Perhaps that means reaching outside our own comfort zones.  Or perhaps it means expanding the circle to include colleagues in open data, AI and other new technologies.  We should be examples, support examples, and demand that more and more of online life incorporate the values that draw us to FLOSS.  And we build and support those people and projects that are doing so.

	00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:14,700
hey folks I think we're gonna get

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:16,080
started my adapter somehow my adapter

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,410
somehow didn't make it with me

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,630
and so I I have an older machine so I'm

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,140
gonna start without slides and if we can

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,480
the magic volunteers can figure out the

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,960
right cable in the right place then

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,480
we'll switch to slides so I'm here

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,989
obviously to talk about floss the future

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,530
and the Internet so a good place to

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,469
start is where we are today and floss is

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,339
everywhere today and and that's a real

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,719
success which is worth celebrating

00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:51,690
doesn't really matter where you look you

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,100
find free software at the heart of the

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,499
Internet at the heart of the big

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,420
services that we use and in all the

00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:02,519
projects various applications so it

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,350
seems kind of obvious today and now free

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,850
software and open source software are

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,210
just a kind of part of mainstream

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,130
development but you know that's really a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,050
surprising thing and when I sort of

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,270
started in this field you know that

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,580
wasn't the case at all and there was a

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,790
real disbelief in free software and

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,730
open-source software as being credible

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,070
in any serious sense I think there's

00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:34,380
some learnings from that that will be

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,120
useful in the current state and so I'm

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,690
thinking back to just around the turn of

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,060
the millennium so 1999 2000 when Mozilla

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,090
was newish about a year old and and I

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,280
spent a lot of time explaining really

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,670
basic questions like what is free

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,610
software why would anyone participate in

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,530
free software why would anyone do

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,270
anything where they didn't get paid I

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,880
mean these always seem to me really

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,790
silly questions given how much time

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,420
people spend doing things they love

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,929
people would also ask well how can you

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,269
do anything without employees and titles

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:15,540
you know how how could it possibly work

00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:17,790
why would people collaborate how could

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,660
you share something and why would we

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,960
ever trust it

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,960
and when you take all of those together

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,050
you know it's clear that that people who

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,120
hadn't been involved in floss and in

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,490
that era you know they couldn't imagine

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,920
it they were living in a different world

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,410
and they couldn't conceive of something

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,650
different and and the world they were

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,660
living in is actually not so dissimilar

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,650
from the one of today

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:51,320
it was pre-internet of course but if you

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:55,980
think today of Facebook and Google and

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,800
the AWS side of Amazon and you roll all

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,830
that up into one company that was the

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,960
world we lived in in 2000 or that

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,320
company was Microsoft it was deeply

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,880
deeply hated but it was the way things

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,810
worked and so the even you call them the

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,930
Technorati

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,450
or the press or the thought leaders or

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,730
most software developers really had

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,820
trouble imagining how the world could be

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,430
different and then the free software and

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,280
open-source movement began to grow and

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,290
to began to move up the stack of

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,230
developer tools into an operating system

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:40,740
into more complicated parts of the stack

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,100
and eventually even up to the consumer

00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,010
product level now that was a surprise

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,870
you know all the time we were developing

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,610
browsers we were told open source and

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,790
free software could never be good enough

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,030
for consumers that I was always too

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,310
rough around the edges and it was really

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,190
only for people who were going to spend

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,920
their life using that but but in fact

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:10,440
the free software movement reached a new

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,650
level and open source and free software

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,680
started to become mainstream and then

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,359
then the conversations I had changed and

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,180
a whole new set of conversations

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,690
appeared and they were questions about

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,660
taking the ideas of floss and applying

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,900
them to different parts of life and so

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,470
there would be questions about I want to

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,830
do

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:39,840
open data or open science or I'm an open

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,810
architecture project trying to

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,240
crowdsource designs of habitable homes

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,410
that you know almost no cost for people

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,260
who are homeless or you know open

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,160
medical records or open health care you

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:59,700
know you name it the the wave of fields

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,660
that suddenly realized shared

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,320
development collaboration not owning

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,370
things making knowledge available became

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,550
immense and also the idea of

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,610
collaboration or sharing or shared value

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,510
began to become mainstream you know in

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,330
that era the idea of sharing cars

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,900
whether its owner is sharing their cars

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,350
through uber or zip cars or shared cars

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,970
was simply unimaginable the idea that

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,620
you would have a bicycle in a city that

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,230
a city would own a bike and allow its

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,840
citizens to use it crazy I mean didn't

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:45,570
didn't exist there was zero of it in the

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:50,490
in that era and so open and free

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:53,760
software began to influence whole ranges

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,790
of fields and so those fields aren't you

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,910
know software per se and don't have

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,850
exactly the same criteria but the effect

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,640
of a small set of technologists thinking

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,919
differently and acting differently and

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,760
building something different

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:19,340
became profound but at the same time

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:21,840
something else was happening and that is

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:26,720
free software and open-source software

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,640
were at the center of Internet products

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,120
but increasingly other aspects were

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,180
being added around them and originally

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,070
it was other software all you know

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,800
according to license so not not

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,200
unexpected but but because the software

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,969
is not distributed we have free software

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,419
and then

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:49,729
there's a fair amount of modifications

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:54,699
made to those which are not returned to

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:58,389
the Commons and then layers of

00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:01,789
algorithms or activities which are not

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:04,789
captured or included and in Floss

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,639
software so there's a whole layer of

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:11,360
algorithmic thinking behind that and

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:16,399
then of course mass amounts of data that

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,399
don't live in a floss like system and so

00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:23,869
when we look at the Internet today you

00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:28,309
can see that there's floss in the center

00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:32,209
and many more layers have closed or

00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:35,299
proprietary unknowable activity

00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:37,489
surrounding that and so although floss

00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:40,549
has been wildly successful at being at

00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:42,499
the center of things we live in a state

00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:46,669
where sort of closed and proprietary

00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:49,039
systems prevail and at the same time the

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:52,009
human experience has been changing you

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,139
know in the early days everything is

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,959
very positive and optimistic and we

00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,589
thought of the web as we called it then

00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,749
as being you know the enabler of

00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:05,329
collaboration and empowerment and

00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:07,399
freedom and knowledge sharing and all

00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:11,239
knowledge for everyone in the world and

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:14,959
a range of very positive things which is

00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:17,539
part of it but increasingly you know we

00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,539
see other activities and the human

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:24,079
experience is sometimes positive and

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,209
sometimes increasingly negative and and

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,039
today you know one question I'm asked

00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:30,289
really frequently is well the the

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,099
Internet is broken you know what what

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,589
can we do and that's a complicated and

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,649
tough problem that has you know software

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,959
elements and data it has probably some

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,909
regulation in it it needs a lot of

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:49,040
innovation and there's a whole set of

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:51,439
systemic changes to build a system

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,000
that's as powerful as it is and also

00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:57,529
healthy but there's one element to

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,930
making better life online

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:04,790
and that I think rarely gets attention

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:07,550
and that I hope we can make clearer and

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:11,889
more obvious and more active and that is

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:16,610
floss communities and floss software

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:21,769
because the set of what I think of as

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,870
floss DNA it is a powerful tool for

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,589
building solutions to the problems we

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,459
have today

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:31,519
and when I say floss DNA I mean three or

00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:35,509
four things one I mean free as in

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,370
freedom which obviously is a you know

00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,019
comes out of the problem of the English

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,509
language that that we don't have the

00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,910
word Libre and so we need to distinguish

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:50,029
free as in freedom you know from free of

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:51,949
charge and that is you know if floss

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,899
software is freeze and freedom the

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:59,509
Internet today is free as in free of

00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:02,240
charge and the idea of what the freedom

00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:05,540
to actually empower yourself and act

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,480
looks like is not in the dialogue today

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,240
and so the four freedoms of free

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,850
software may not apply directly to how

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,730
does an individual live but the concept

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,889
that you can get engaged that you can

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,439
participate that you can see what's

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,589
happening that the rules that apply to

00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:28,189
me apply to you those core things that

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:30,829
drive the freedom of free software are

00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:33,559
not part of the internet experience and

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:35,779
many people can't imagine what that

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,730
would look like and and when you talk

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,949
about individuals maybe being able to

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,129
participate or see their data or use

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:45,199
their data the response is often oh my

00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,600
gosh that's so hard that couldn't happen

00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:50,569
what would look like nobody would care

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,269
nobody would do it who would bother how

00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:57,019
would you design a system and those

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:59,749
sounds sort of daunting but in fact it's

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,389
very very similar to the kinds of

00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:06,550
questions people used to ask about free

00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:11,640
software and so this

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,840
question of how do we make the idea of

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,630
participation and the ability to act

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,550
right so with software consuming it's

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,240
not enough how can i how can I actually

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,420
touch it and change it and act is a core

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,850
question we face at a broader scale both

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,730
at a product development and development

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,780
level online and for you know the

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:38,440
consumer and citizen as well so that's

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,420
that's one area of floss where the

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,420
background and experience in living

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,600
could be effective in helping solve

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,410
today's problems and also I would say

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,380
open as an open source not open as it

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,540
has come to mean today which is the

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,850
powerful can grab whatever they want and

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,320
do whatever they want with it that seems

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:05,320
to be what I hear open what people think

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,090
it means but open source you know I mean

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,670
lives by the same licenses and

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:13,690
definitions and and lives with a set of

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:18,940
equality and ability to participate the

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:22,900
second area you know free software

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,790
creates shared value and that's partly

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,070
why we created it is because it's

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,400
valuable and it's valuable for for

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,520
people of different viewpoints and

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,620
perspectives and goals it's not both

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,650
centralized this is good for me and

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,280
everyone else lives in this system and

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:45,040
today like the idea of shared value or

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,920
interoperability or competition or real

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,140
sort of linked ability back and forth or

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,900
if people being able to take parts of a

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,560
project and use it is not part of online

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,260
life that we we're back into a closed

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,690
system and so once again you know the

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,450
idea that of having lived these things

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,480
and built the kinds of software that the

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:11,140
floss movement has built is a powerful

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,600
tool and in solving these things you

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,500
know floss communities also

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:22,269
have a value of collaboration rather

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,550
than the command and control of you know

00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,269
one organization owning and deciding

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,839
everything

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:30,279
so another clearly needed value and the

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,110
last one I would say is earning

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,850
leadership which is closely related to

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,459
integrity and Trust you know in a very

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,079
different model from being an employee

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:44,259
you know and being told what to do and

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:47,230
the floss world has just such a broad

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,389
range of how to earn leadership and what

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,670
it means and how you keep leadership and

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:56,350
how you inspire people and how you make

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,389
something effective and so you know it

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,370
is pretty broad range so for example at

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:04,180
Mozilla we do not have you know leaders

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:07,480
for life some projects do you know as a

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,480
as a mark of the founders and respect

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,529
and so on so we have a broad diversity

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,360
we don't have Mozilla I feel like my job

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,639
as a leader is to continue to earn that

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,949
leadership and at some point if I'm not

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,290
doing the best job or I don't have

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:25,810
anything unique to offer then it's time

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,089
for me to move on and and if I don't do

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,910
that voluntarily then you know I think

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,430
the project should have the right to

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:35,589
make it clear to me that someone else

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,110
would be doing a better job I mean I'm

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,839
not looking forward to that but but I

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,850
think that those sorts of practices and

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:48,430
policies are not common in current

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:52,720
society and that the experience is that

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:56,529
we as a broad community bring have

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,550
immense value and so where would we

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,060
those things

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:05,110
well one key problem today you know is

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,339
online you are the product and so

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:14,080
there's a current understanding that you

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:16,720
need immense profiles to deliver ads and

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,340
the conventional wisdom is oh well we

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,950
couldn't I mean ads run the system and

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:29,190
you have to have these vast amounts of

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:32,350
data in order to sell ads and I'm really

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,480
interested in exploring exactly what

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,590
information you need for what purposes

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,150
so for example we running and you know

00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:44,140
we have a product at Mozilla it's called

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,970
pocket and and we're experimenting so I

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,940
want to start I'll say it many times we

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:54,600
have no profiles no profiles no profiles

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:57,490
no profiles pocket is about identifying

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,960
reading that you want to take some time

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:06,190
to read like what's content that's worth

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,920
attention and reflection and so it's a

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,380
simple tool you know you save something

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,270
to read it for later right turns out

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,100
like that doesn't happen that often

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:19,120
online a lot of times people see a

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,970
headline and and and share it but but

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,690
actually our reading material and so

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,590
what we're doing with Bako is to use

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:41,980
those signals

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:45,220
oh that's okay that's okay

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:49,840
I can do it I'm just wondering probably

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:54,850
shouldn't go backward huh this is it so

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:57,190
on the pocket piece left and right there

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,380
we go okay so you're going to see some

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,580
of the older slides right this is the

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,740
set of questions

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,730
[Music]

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:11,939
this is the oppa floss at the center you

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:24,480
know the layers that I spoke about being

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:28,710
added around it is a little slow here

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,559
closed systems experience on the

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,250
internet used to be all sunny now it's

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,110
you know we have these very dark

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:44,520
concerns like what's actually happening

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,870
what do we do want to answer like this

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,419
is something we are not in the

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,630
discussion at all like of who are the

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,940
sets of people and who has ideas and

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:58,110
lived and built something different than

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:02,149
the conventional software before floss

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,950
values freeze and freedom this is the

00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:07,080
you know a single entity ringing every

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,110
last dollar out of the system no matter

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:15,690
what the cost system we're living in

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:19,260
today with the sort of alternative that

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:24,360
the floss system lives with which is

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,850
shared value for many the collaboration

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,140
piece I talked about earning leadership

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:33,270
and okay so clearly there's a set of key

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,809
problems on life what might we be able

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:41,549
to address so item one you know you are

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:44,220
the product and so this is the the

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,970
combination of ads which exist

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,640
everywhere so you know both personally

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,470
in a Mozilla we are not anti ad I mean

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,409
they're annoying and I certainly like

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,899
life without them but most of radio and

00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,690
TV and magazines and newspapers you know

00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:03,330
ads are everywhere and they support a

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,549
ton of system so we're not ready to say

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,380
somehow magically we're going to make

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,850
something new that doesn't have ads I

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,909
mean I'd love it but I don't I don't

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,500
know what to offer but what we are

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:15,160
adamantly opposed to is the current

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,590
tracking system

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,170
goes with ads and this question of

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,500
profiles so we have this experiment with

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,800
pocket which is can we deliver

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,990
interesting long-form content to you

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,420
customized to you without profiles

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,550
because the conventional wisdom is you

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,640
need a profile for anything and the more

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:40,210
data that you get anywhere the better it

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,100
is and so far for long-form content at

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,190
least we're finding that yes we can

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,250
actually deliver personalized content to

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,010
you without a profile now we do that by

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,810
having the logic on device and so

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,570
information is delivered to your browser

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:58,930
or your pocket wherever it is on your

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,760
phone and and that that device obviously

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,940
has a lot of information about you and

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,680
it makes a selection and you as a user

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,600
can say oh I don't ever want to see

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,060
anything like that again make it all go

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,640
away or you can say oh that's

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,710
interesting I ignore it or you can you

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,500
know choose to read it or engage in some

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,570
fashion and so what we're finding is

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,330
that the information that's on your

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:25,420
device which we never see and don't

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:31,390
collect don't use to track you because

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,840
we don't have it is quite acceptable for

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,520
delivering content that you might enjoy

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,220
so that's an interesting experiment

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,250
we're not like that's not to say you can

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,250
deliver ads I don't know you know that's

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,930
a different set of experiments that we

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,320
would like to see lots of people being

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,660
able to engage in and then there's a

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,340
kind of profile which is useful for

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,940
encouraging people to do all sorts of

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,490
things and and that's the kind of

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:07,150
profile that sucks up all the data about

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,740
you and uses every last thing you know

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,530
and uses that profile knows probably

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:16,270
more about what motivates you than you

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,320
do so we've seen for example use an

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,060
example out of the United States

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,920
probably Russian of targeting very

00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,560
specific groups of people with the goal

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,630
of getting you know X percentage of this

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,990
group to come to a demonstration

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,390
because they're outraged about X and at

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,180
the same time targeting another group of

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,190
people to come to the same demonstration

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,340
because they're outraged about the

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,010
opposite and so the actual creation

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:55,540
through micro targeting based on

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:58,810
profiles of a civil protest and so

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,430
that's a special kind of profile right

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,230
that's the and and the conventional

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,820
wisdom is that gathering everything up

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,730
this is like this happened on Facebook

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,770
so just to say that like yes you need

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,200
all that information in order to be able

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,030
to do socially useful things but we

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,940
don't actually know that like is it

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,650
socially useful to outraged groups of

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,330
people so they go out on the street and

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,930
fight each other over something that

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,400
isn't actually real like probably not so

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:29,500
I think it's a very interesting question

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,710
of what do you actually need to run I'll

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,980
call it mainstream commerce you know

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,750
whether it's content or even ads versus

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,280
how much information is being collected

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:45,730
about us now and used to manipulate

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,940
behavior and I think if if we could

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,970
build more products that tested more of

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,940
these things it would tell us whether

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:58,750
some form of information gathering is

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,650
just socially terrible right and and

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:05,850
that the business of targeting at a

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,470
level of manipulation where you can

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,630
intentionally create violent

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,090
disturbances might be treated

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,370
differently than a profile that was

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,250
adequate for e-commerce and that

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,170
requires a lot of testing right it

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:24,190
requires research on an academic level

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:28,110
and it also requires you know you know

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:30,340
products that are on the like how much

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,920
information do I actually need to do

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,400
something legitimate and so I mentioned

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,540
product pocket because it's one

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,760
sometimes if I say that without an

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,260
example people think Oh

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,260
you're kind of crazy or what would that

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,899
mean but but we have one in the market

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,350
that's you know actually well-received

00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:53,080
and so that I think is a power of floss

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,750
software is to build and test those

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,519
things and demonstrate that a different

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:05,769
kind of product and experience is

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:08,470
possible originally these had

00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:10,450
transitions so that's why there's so

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,179
many of these slides in here but a

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,230
second problem is clearly content and

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:20,889
misinformation and how do we even know

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:23,950
what might be reliable or whether it

00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:25,409
fits our criteria of trust or not and

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,490
this is another area where

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:32,590
experimentation in software and products

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,350
is important so we have a little

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:40,630
experiment here too called the Facebook

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:43,630
ad analyzer which is currently awarded

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:47,230
by Facebook so we'll see what happens

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:51,870
but but what this you know the Facebook

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:54,669
has information about here's an ad

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,220
here's the organization that's paying

00:24:54,669 --> 00:25:02,950
for the ad and here are the targeting

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:07,750
criteria and so this is an election

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:14,309
cycle in the EU and we thought it would

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:20,830
be helpful when you're seeing ads about

00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:23,529
EU candidates to be able to you know

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,919
select an ad and say well eh who's

00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:29,919
paying for it and why am i seeing it am

00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,679
i seeing it because I'm a woman in a

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,960
certain age group living here or am i

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,029
seeing it because I went to some

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,480
particular site about immigration and

00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:46,720
got tagged as you know Pro immigration

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:49,179
anti immigration Pro acts so this is

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,010
because that transparency of political

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,530
ads in

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,350
in the EU is highly regulated and is

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:58,830
seen as an important piece we've been

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,910
trying to bring some added transparency

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:04,500
to the current election cycle but

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,929
Facebook broke that in the last couple

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:12,450
of days and so this is clearly an area

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:14,490
that requires either the big platforms

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,280
to be interested in it or some kind of

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,169
regulatory engagement now fortunately

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,730
the EU has been involved in this and

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,130
there is a code of practice and we

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:26,429
believe that Facebook actually agreed to

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,860
make this information available and so

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,150
we've asked the EU Commission to look

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,900
into it and see if our understanding

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:36,600
that this add information should be

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,960
available for the for the political apps

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,309
and so this is an area of product

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,440
experimentation which is harder to do

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,809
unless you're involved in policy or

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,630
unless there is some policy or practice

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:54,030
in place but it's also an area where the

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:55,559
EU is you know world leader and so we

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,620
think that there's increasing

00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,240
possibility here and I know like in the

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,320
early days of PLoS like for the first

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,600
decade of Mozilla I did not want us

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,880
engaging in things that required policy

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,309
activities that because they're hard

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,080
it's a different skill set you know but

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:15,450
about a decade ago I thought the time

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,940
had changed so so Mozilla's active in

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,880
policy and the good news is there are a

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,730
lot of I would say Internet activists

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,710
who are realistic policy driven so in

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,419
these questions oh wow I want to build

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:32,070
software you know I don't want to deal

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:34,140
with codes of practice or regulators the

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,510
good news is there are many people out

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,120
there who do and what what they really

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:43,410
need is connections to technologists and

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:47,570
so the will and energy to do this is

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:50,370
very high particularly in Europe and

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,590
developing better connections between I

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,020
would say not just technologists but the

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,419
floss community in particular and these

00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:03,429
advocacy groups would help us a fair

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:06,249
amount and the third big area

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:10,289
really to aim at I call the addiction

00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:13,809
economy maybe I'll go back on that one

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:16,269
because not what the you know the

00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,799
designers of internet experiences what

00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:21,009
they're aiming for is to make people

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:23,080
happy because when you're happy you stay

00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:25,749
on their site you engage in their site

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,389
you do the things that generate revenue

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:31,359
for them but it turns out and the

00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:33,940
research is showing that what really the

00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,070
look like that fight-or-flight response

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,859
the way you activate human beings

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:42,489
quickest and fastest is with fear and

00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:44,289
outrage and so even with the motivation

00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:48,039
of people being happy to stay on their

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:51,009
site a lot of the most effective ways of

00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,859
doing that are appealing to the I would

00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:58,389
say more difficult sides of human nature

00:28:53,859 --> 00:29:04,589
fear anger outrage violence and so the

00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:04,589
addiction economy given human nature is

00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:15,789
very closely tied into lost a few of

00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:19,089
them but it's closely tied into these

00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:24,009
practices that we're seeing where the

00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:26,919
degree of violence and anger and

00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:31,089
disruptive behavior online is really

00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:34,450
quite high let's just see okay and so

00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:36,190
that that leads us to the question you

00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,919
know we saw this a little bit in open

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,599
source communities early on where when

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,409
people came online

00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:47,259
you know you sometimes you'd find really

00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:50,200
aggressive and nasty behavior and and

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:53,109
women in Floss communities early on were

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,450
targeted quite aggressively and the

00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:58,479
overall level of discourse was a little

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,669
nasty at least for people who came into

00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:03,369
it you know at Mozilla this was a

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:06,009
constant problem as we were trying to

00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,259
introduce new people into the open

00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:10,509
source world and they would be wow you

00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:13,820
know what you're trying to do is so nice

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:17,390
but the online discussion is

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,700
harsh well it turns out that has zero to

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,490
do with free software or open source

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,830
communities that's for some reason what

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,050
much of humanity does when we first

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,540
encounter these tools like the harshness

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,850
comes out and so you see it and like how

00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:35,020
common death threats are online today

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:38,630
you know and I would bet real money that

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,190
if and when we track down you know these

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,190
deaths and you know rape and torture

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,340
threats many people will be otherwise of

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,710
standing citizens that somehow feel free

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:52,130
online you know to engage in this

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,350
behavior so figuring out like what is it

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:58,910
that encourages something better than

00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:01,400
that and how do we break this cycle and

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,380
here again I think free software and

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,600
open-source communities have a lot to

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,930
offer because we've been dealing with it

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,240
for a while and the quality of discourse

00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,550
in our communities has changed and the

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,590
standards of behaviors have changed and

00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:18,380
community practice and community

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,450
etiquette and what is acceptable and how

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,000
do you deal with the troll or a Poisson

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,000
person like we have a set of experience

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,610
in those things that is certainly

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,270
imperfect and we have far more to go but

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:34,130
nevertheless it's a stage ahead of where

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,370
most people trying to deal with these

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:39,140
kinds of questions are and so just as we

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,380
were early in the sharing and

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,060
collaborative and freedom aspect the how

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,700
do you make a community what's healthy

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:50,240
how do you get to better behavior we

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:55,270
have some experience with it and I'll go

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:58,220
back and say I'm quite convinced that

00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:03,260
technologists have a huge role to play

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:07,480
in how do we create software and

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:10,520
products and online experiences that are

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,460
encouraging better aspects of human

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,500
nature that currently the economy is

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,890
driving towards the addiction economy

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,390
where you're the product and where we're

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,690
gathering so much information that

00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:28,070
are easy to manipulate and so I think

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,350
absolutely requires technologists to be

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,680
involved and to be committed to that and

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:37,100
so in the last few years I personally

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,400
and for Mozilla felt really compelled to

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:46,460
make that commitment clear compelled

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,630
because you know the open system the

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,880
open Internet

00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,820
the World Wide Web you know the

00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,790
graphical layer which is open open

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,090
source free software like these are so

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:03,050
fundamental and so important and yet not

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:05,810
enough they are not enough to create an

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:08,090
online life that is decent they're not

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:12,500
enough to stop trolls they're not enough

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:15,110
on their own to be an alternative the

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,720
systems that encourage sort of outrage

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:20,360
and violence and so i felt quite

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,050
compelled that that at least i and

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:27,380
testing you know mozilla felt equally

00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:29,330
committed to something different and so

00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,830
we've made some commitments you know

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,190
Mozilla's clearly it's an open source

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:40,040
project i think the speaker before noted

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:43,910
were imperfect but committed to open

00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,830
source we have a manifesto that talks

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,410
about security and privacy and

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,260
individual empowerment and just felt we

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,330
needed something more and so we set out

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,220
four additional things about the

00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:59,660
internet that are important to us you

00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:03,710
know one that it's inclusive that's the

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:06,230
wrong button here you know internet

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:10,730
experiences software and products

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,409
currently are encouraged outraged what

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,020
would it look like if we were actually

00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:18,460
trying to encourage civil discourse you

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:21,500
know and rationality and thoughtfulness

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:24,169
you might not maybe be the richest

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,630
company on the face of the earth but

00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:30,200
that's not what really floss aims to be

00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:32,600
and then finally we are actually

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,760
committed to trying to take that value

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,340
of collaborate

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,250
and shared good and trying to extend it

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:43,540
further from the floss software itself

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,159
out into other areas and I was happy to

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,380
find that you know not just me

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,300
personally but that this sort of

00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,970
resonated within Mozilla so we've

00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,580
adopted it as part of our core sort of

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,430
manifesto and and how we think of of who

00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,370
we are and it it may or may not be quite

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,500
right for you because floss is really

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,430
varied and we have lots of diversity

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,320
among us but I am hopeful that as a

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,180
community of communities this question

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,930
of can we actually build a better online

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,060
life is is increasingly important and

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:19,990
that we actually can represent ourselves

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:24,010
well in the overall discussion which is

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:25,330
lacking in technologists when you at

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,950
least in there in the worlds that I

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:33,340
travel in or it is hard to find a large

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:35,470
loud technical voice other than the

00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,740
large platforms so Mozilla is very

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,720
welcome when we show up and that's great

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,580
and there's a lot of diversity and floss

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,120
so it would be great to see others as

00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:50,860
well and then finally the last thing

00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:53,530
that Mozilla does that not all floss

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,730
projects do is really focus on the

00:35:53,530 --> 00:36:00,010
consumer because you know that's most of

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,290
humanity and that's where there's a

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,810
certain kind of impact like that's a

00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,910
messy place to be as a floss project

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,550
because you have to take what you're

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,890
trying to accomplish as floss and in our

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,480
case with the manifesto and yet build a

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,000
product you know that consumers want

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,580
which is generally free of charge and

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,980
convenient and fun and interesting so

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,860
it's messy you know and and causes us to

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,350
be you know imperfect in many ways but

00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,350
it is a piece of the puzzle that we try

00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:35,550
to bring to the overalls or floss world

00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:41,170
and so to circle back to the core point

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:44,000
that floss communities floss DNA and the

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,840
floss principles can

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,750
be like a powerful force for improving

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,480
the state of Internet life and I hope

00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,150
you find that to be true and I certainly

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,120
hope you find if you're interested ways

00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,920
to be effective at that and if you were

00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,440
trying to do such things you know I

00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,710
certainly offer myself and Mozilla to

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,550
try and provide whatever I don't know

00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:12,080
support or assistance or cheerleading or

00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:16,630
anything else that we can do to help

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,630
more people be successful thank you

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,830
and I think they're not here but I want

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:34,560
to say special thanks to the volunteers

00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:42,610
and crew here who made up for my lost

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:45,400
adapter so just a small announcement

00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,590
there are still five minutes for

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,670
questions so if you have a question

00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:53,860
please let me know I will give you the

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,360
microphone for that and please if you

00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:59,700
are leaving be quiet

00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,700
still the session is is not your finish

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:25,800
I have a question okay on the on

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,470
dominance practically you mentioned that

00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,380
large corporations dominating the

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:36,400
internet so on a technology side when

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:40,270
you look at the browser's we now we see

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,680
today that practically the domination is

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:51,280
chromium in floss sense or Google Chrome

00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:53,410
and it's it's not modular anymore so so

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,470
I'm and I'm guessing that most of the

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,480
people here in this room also use Chrome

00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:01,060
and I'm a little worried about that so

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,010
what what do you think about this kind

00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,010
of domination on the desktop I would say

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:11,230
yes so their question about the risk of

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:15,880
domination in the browser space or the

00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:17,500
desktop yeah I think it's quite real i I

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,940
do want to admit that there were some

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,600
years there and which chrome was a

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,730
better browser I think that that time

00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,000
has passed

00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:30,880
and certainly technically you know it's

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,240
great to have the crown again and so it

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,130
is a question of why use chromium or why

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,930
use Chrome

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,230
you know sometimes Google breaks things

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:43,480
except for Chrome it's only a day or two

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,870
and it's always some low-level product

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,390
manager that just can't be controlled so

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,550
maybe that's why but I actually am

00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:57,010
interested it'd be interesting you know

00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:59,110
to know I think it's so real risk and I

00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,810
what I really think is at risk is what

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:04,210
we call the web like so why do we care

00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,640
so much yeah I love Firefox right but

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:11,110
but really why do we care so much we

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,620
care because right now Google is almost

00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:18,210
free to do whatever it wants and call it

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,470
the web and it does it makes up api's

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,630
sometimes they're useful sometimes

00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,730
they're really Google specific sometimes

00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,010
they have tons of problems there isn't

00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,510
like there are standards bodies but you

00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,360
know with its market share it doesn't

00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,340
really matter

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,190
and so the reason that we care about

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:37,070
Firefox yes there's a product piece and

00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,530
we love it but the core reason is the

00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:44,080
web and we are about to lose the web

00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:46,550
like interoperable multi-vendor

00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,530
platform I mean we don't think of the

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,540
web now but the technology that we call

00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,790
the Internet the graphical lay all the

00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,470
stuff that you can see and that gets

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,650
delivered through a browser engine

00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:00,350
whatever app you're using soon that is

00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,870
about to be Google again the only thing

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,900
standing in its way right now is Firefox

00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,460
or gecko and it is not at all clear that

00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,160
we are gonna succeed

00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,020
I should be loud and clear about that

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,150
the question of whether we have what we

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,880
used to think of as the web is the

00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:19,580
question right now and we are investing

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,130
a ton and it is so expensive because for

00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,840
some reason Google has accelerated the

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,790
number of people in development and

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,540
stuff they're adding in in a way that's

00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:31,310
very hard to keep up with and and and I

00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,320
guess it's good for developers but that

00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,810
question like the next year may tell

00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,030
that question right and so we're still

00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,430
committed because you know we love the

00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,620
web I mean but but something that's

00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:48,650
interoperable like we're just on the

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:50,630
edge so I don't anyway I guess thank you

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:58,300
for asking because I clearly care about

00:41:50,630 --> 00:42:01,280
it so a couple of years ago at PAWS dam

00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,920
2014 I believe I went to a great talk by

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,720
a guy called Paul Henning camp who gave

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,960
it to a satirical talk about the state

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,810
of online security he speculated that

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,990
the influence of the NSA and GCHQ was

00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:16,760
deliberately weakening online security

00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:19,490
and in the face of such powerful

00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,530
influence against our sort of interests

00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,930
and the technical solutions were

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,730
ineffective he concluded his talk by

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,250
saying that this is a political problem

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,320
this is not a technical problem and I

00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,110
guess you could make a similar argument

00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,840
in the sense that such heavily heavy

00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,650
influencers Google and Facebook and kind

00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,210
of faces interference in elections and

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,250
you could say that well in the face of

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,140
such heavy heavy

00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,000
Faust's technical solutions are in

00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:50,110
effect you know I'm sorry I'm really

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,870
having trouble hearing sorry and what

00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,970
would you say to the the proposal that

00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,090
in the face of such heavy influence by

00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,230
Facebook and Google against sort of

00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,610
freedom and online privacy

00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:07,020
the technical solutions are ineffective

00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:09,940
that this is a political problem well

00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:14,380
sort of monopolies are part political

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:16,450
part technical problem for one well

00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,510
that's interesting is it a political or

00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:22,590
a technical problem like well the the

00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:27,460
issue is it's actually both right now

00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:29,790
how do you regulate right and so that

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,140
that is part of why I think that the

00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,360
flossed communities are important

00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,820
because you need experimentation to know

00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,190
how to regulate so for example you know

00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,170
if the EU Commission appeared in front

00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,350
of us and said just tell us what to do

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:47,800
like what's the answer like you could

00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:51,840
you could say the basic ad model is

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,880
unacceptable right what happens then

00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:58,030
right and let's say you know like do you

00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:04,330
want to not have facebook I don't know

00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:05,830
so so so that question and then the

00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,690
other political question is sometimes

00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,420
you can't ant innovate because the

00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,010
monopolies are so powerful Allah the ad

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,110
problem that we're having and then

00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,660
that's a political question but it needs

00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:20,860
the technical voice in there to explain

00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,010
it and thus my pitch for you know if you

00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,870
find the local Internet advocates who

00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,460
are trying to advocate for privacy but

00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,520
don't know anything about technology

00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,920
like you know even if your inclination

00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,440
is to kind of like leave them you know a

00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:40,180
little bit of help on technical chops

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:44,040
will go a long way so thank you yeah

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,040
let's thank our speaker with

00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:50,860
[Applause]

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,860
