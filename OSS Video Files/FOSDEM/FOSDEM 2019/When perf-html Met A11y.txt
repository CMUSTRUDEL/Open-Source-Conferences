One in seven people is disabled. 

And accessible websites (and apps!) enable them to work on an even playing field, while also being more usable for everyone. 

For the past couple of months, I've been working on improving the accessibility of perf-html, Mozilla's virtuoso profiler. 

During this talk, I'll be sharing my journey into the world of accessibility and demonstrating how perf-html aims to make Mozilla not just more performant, but also more usable for everyone. 

Topics covered: Focus, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, ARIA and Accessibility inspector &lt;3

00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,989
welcome for the last talk for today is a

00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:30,159
talk that talk about the accessibility

00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:33,599
yeah can everyone hear me okay at the

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:36,549
back cool so thank you all for staying

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,929
till now it's been a marathon day I

00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:41,799
should have brought snacks

00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:43,869
for myself I mean also for you has

00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:47,409
anyone here watched the movie When Harry

00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:49,360
Met Sally okay so this talk is not gonna

00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,269
be about that I was trying to be clever

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,969
and like crying but then I was

00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:57,009
explaining like my sister who's a doctor

00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,839
so I assume she's clever

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,629
she asked me like what the talk is gonna

00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,019
be about and I was like so it's titled

00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,699
like when power of HTML met a leak or

00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,939
like When Harry Met Sally and she didn't

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,859
get it so I thought it would be bad so I

00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:18,489
wanted to skip this but I didn't so I'm

00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:22,059
just gonna say hi and my name is Eva

00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:24,689
I'm originally from Slovenia I live in

00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:28,360
China anyone else living in here

00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:30,999
seriously wow that is really cool

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,549
so yes I'm from Slovenia I lived in

00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:35,889
China for a few years I was doing mine

00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:39,309
during Chinese just lighting then I

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,729
moved to the UK and I work there now as

00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:44,919
a web developer I'm also a proud owner

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,069
I mean owner is stretching it cuz you

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,610
can't ever own cats I live together with

00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:54,729
two Chinese cats so they're Chinese you

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:59,499
can tell but they are and a Mexican dog

00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:01,419
and I joined Mozilla very recently so in

00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:04,419
December of last year so it's two months

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,099
ago I joined as an intern because you

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,699
know they say why not it's never too

00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,799
late for a career change and today I

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,449
want to talk to you about this really

00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:18,819
cool project called curved HTML I know

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,979
you must be thinking like amazing name

00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:25,690
we must marketing branded now but it's

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,750
it's really a cool - so it's it's

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:33,069
Amazon's gecko profiler and its main job

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:35,470
is to analyze the web performance it's a

00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:39,129
really really complex tool so I remember

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:41,770
the first time I saw it it was not a

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:44,530
magic moment I was I was like okay where

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,069
do I start because despite its name

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,729
curve is not perfect it's actually a

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,650
little bit broken especially from the

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,620
accessibility standpoint so I was trying

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,150
to demo how it doesn't work but because

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,849
it doesn't work it's really hard to demo

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,310
but here you can see like just one of

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,259
the issues was when I was trying to

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,319
navigate with a keyboard like you got

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,389
this hideous button overlay display and

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,349
this is just one of the things that I

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:16,599
fixed so I hopefully made perfect email

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,900
a little bit better so this talk is

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,139
going to be more like a practical over

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:27,009
you're like how I tackled accessibility

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:29,949
issues and I will first start with what

00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:32,200
perf HTML is how many of you here if you

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:36,159
raise your hands have ever used perfect

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:43,240
amount okay okay how many of you that is

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:45,850
not my team okay so okay okay so just

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,680
just to brief you know overview so I

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,000
don't do this you so perfect email is to

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,160
start using it you need to store the

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,399
Gecko profile area which looks like this

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,320
and then you can head on to any web site

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,230
wherever you want and you can take

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,950
snapshot of the activity so this is

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,250
cnn.com

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,430
a couple days ago and what I did was I

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,279
loaded it I started a profiler I hit

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,829
refresh and I got this profile so that

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,010
is the snapshot of activity of what

00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:20,589
happens when you hit reload so like the

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,750
layout graphics and JavaScript all the

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:25,240
good stuff but when you look at it it's

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,519
quite it's quite complex so if I just

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,550
briefly explain it like the first half

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,600
of the page is the timeline on the

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,149
left-hand side

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,759
you have the thread names and on the

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,560
bottom you have the different panel so

00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,110
you have cultural flame graph stack

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,500
chart and so on and all of these are

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,360
just different ways of displaying the

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,170
information that the profiler collected

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,899
so that's either by samples so by

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,889
default you take like one millisecond

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:59,589
you take a snapshot or buy markers and

00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:02,170
typically when when you take a profile

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,690
you start by okay it depends on on what

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,930
you you're looking into but you start by

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,910
zooming in so you would look for the red

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,100
bars here for example so that just means

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,220
that some amount of work is being done

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,380
or even that something was stuck so you

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,769
would zooming in on that and then you'll

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,259
get a colorful graph like this so all

00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,810
the yellow stuff is JavaScript and all

00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,360
the purple stuff is layouts and all the

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,490
green stuff is graphics and on the

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,130
bottom you can see like the running time

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,560
and self time and with the profile it

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,630
tries to be helpful so by default it

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,670
throws you into all that this function

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,000
has a really long self time you might

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:47,410
try to start there so that is what an

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,449
engineer might do so this is a tool that

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:55,300
is extensively used by Firefox engineers

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:58,569
and to make Firefox faster and so my

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,389
project was to make hits more usable and

00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:05,920
more accessible because we planned to

00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:07,630
kind of like make this a really a tool

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
that every web developer could use in

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,079
the future to analyze their websites and

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,819
their apps and so I approached this

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,550
project from accessibility standpoint so

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,800
when accessibility is a really long word

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,930
and in computing you're always trying to

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,620
be efficient so another term for you is

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:30,100
a 11y or Ali so you take the first

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,170
letter so I take the last letter Y and

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,839
then you count all the letters it's 11

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:41,199
and that's how you get a 11 Y so today I

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,820
want to just start with a case for

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,960
accessibility cuz

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm sure you know that disabilities in

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,540
various shapes and forms effects a huge

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,210
number of people so roughly 15% which

00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:00,160
amounts to a billion people which is a

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:03,190
lot and if you design inclusively you

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,860
will not only help people that have

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,590
disabilities I believe that you will

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,360
help everyone because you will make you

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,370
will benefit everyone and you'll provide

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,730
a better experience for every user of

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:19,180
your application and so these are just a

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,700
couple of most common accessibility

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,500
issues I don't go into too much detail

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,390
because I think it's more interesting to

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,790
kind of give you the use cases and how

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,030
what we used in our project so things

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,630
like color contrast and missing all

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,900
attributes and readability errormsgs

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:40,540
consistency and area so some people

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,940
think that area is like this magic pill

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,530
that you can so you can just like stuff

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,810
your app with area attributes and

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,260
suddenly your app is going to be super

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:53,800
accessible it's not just area so area if

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,470
you've done things right your app will

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,500
already be like 90% there if you use

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,990
semantic hTML and if you use the right

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,030
CSS if you put the element in the

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,400
correct order if you make focusable

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,730
elements focusable and then on top of

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,380
that you just add area which will help

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,690
assistive technology so there will

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,900
enhance the experience for people that

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,240
use screen readers for example so

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,620
because time is precious and I only had

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,500
three months to work on this I started

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,920
we like a strategic approach of auditing

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,330
the app so yes you can do also lots of

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,600
things with automated testing but the

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,700
best way to test your app for

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,040
accessibility she is with manual testing

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,600
so what I did was I started using it

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,000
which is the keyboard with a screen

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,990
reader and I didn't get really far

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,900
because it was quite difficult and

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:53,089
luckily our projects that lives on

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,749
github we already have quite

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:58,309
organized economic and labeled issues so

00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:00,499
there's also an accessibility issue so I

00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:05,569
just are like filing all the things that

00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:07,579
I found were problematic and then the

00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:09,649
plan right so I find out all these

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:12,050
issues but then we try to think about

00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,259
what would be the thing that would be

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,360
most impactful and one thing would be

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,490
that color and contrast maybe designing

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,459
a dark theme but the other thing that we

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,550
found that was really problematic was we

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,069
did not support keyboard use at all so

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,379
we thought by working on keyboard

00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:32,809
application we will not only help screen

00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,759
readers but also the you know the power

00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:36,860
user so people that use the app every

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,370
day and they're just trying to be more

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,800
effective and faster so I focused

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:47,449
specifically on keyboard navigation and

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:51,379
semantic HTML and managing folks okay so

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:54,230
the good stuff the actual kind of like

00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:58,069
issues and how I solve them so the first

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,620
thing that I did was that buttons kind

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:04,160
of overlapping so what happened here was

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,620
we had like five buttons that were

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,929
displaying at different times but if you

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,670
were tabbing if you were using tab to go

00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,170
through them they would suddenly just go

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,600
one on top of each other and there was

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,610
no way of interacting with them and to

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,360
check that I'm here I'm using on the

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,230
right hand side the Firefox

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,540
accessibility inspector which is a

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,170
really cool tool and it's just been

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,839
released a couple months ago and so here

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,970
you can see that so in the accessibility

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,439
inspector you would get to see what a

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,850
screen reader what the type of

00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:37,610
information that the screen reader will

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,439
get so here there's like five bucks and

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,809
so we have share and permalink and

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,850
upload error and share with you our else

00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,410
and we also have a progress bar so one

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,079
on top like all five of them on top of

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,230
each other so here you what I did was

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,390
like instead of having all of them there

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,769
we

00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:59,730
so I I rendered them conditionally like

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:04,170
as we're using react and so the next bit

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,519
would be so we had all these tabs that

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,100
you could click on and you would select

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,380
ranges but you couldn't do anything with

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,230
a keyboard so a good rule of families is

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,269
that if you can click on something to

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,360
interact with it you should be able to

00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:21,540
do the same thing with a keyboard so we

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,089
have all these different threads names

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,440
of network compositor web extensions and

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:28,230
they're just like completely and

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,890
accessible so and the other issue was

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:35,610
that they were actually inside of an h1

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:40,980
tag so which is a no-no so as you know

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,709
like 1:1 pay web page should only have

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,079
one h1 tag as other otherwise which is

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:49,620
being confusing so instead I wrapped

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,050
this into a button and by by using a

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,850
button which is a native HTML element

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,570
you get all these really cool free stuff

00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,750
so you get the role of a button you get

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:04,589
an on click and on keydown event

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:08,429
listeners as well and so yeah just like

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:11,069
a quick caution so if you have a

00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:14,160
tendency to custom design your check

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,350
boxes and buttons make sure that you

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,829
don't just give it you know ok this is

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:22,860
this is a div that I call my button and

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,679
I just give it an onclick event and

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,540
problem solved No so in order to provide

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,059
a properly functional button you can

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,210
have to commit a roll on click on key

00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:36,780
down and attack index oh by a tab index

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,440
you'll be able to access the button in

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,030
the tab sequence

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
cool so next thing was focused

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,429
management so as I was going next to the

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,070
page like suddenly like I found myself

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:51,660
in uncharted water so like I like just

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,490
the tab would disappear I wouldn't know

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,980
where I was it was really difficult to

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,940
debug and I found this really cool

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,330
function that uses the JavaScript

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,659
native

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,200
eventlistener so focusing and by doing

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:09,719
that if you don't just console.log it as

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,479
you tap through your app you will get

00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:15,719
like all the information about Oh focus

00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:18,570
I'm in input yes good focus again input

00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:22,049
or a class so this is like it's really

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,839
good for debugging where your focus is

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:27,239
and just a side note like sometimes when

00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,820
we tackle accessibility issues with

00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:32,909
trying to do too much so you you're like

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,729
okay I will now make everything terrible

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:39,019
so you'll be able to go to every heading

00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:41,459
and everything like that but again if

00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,169
something is not interactive don't put

00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:47,249
it in your tab index like don't don't

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:49,709
put it in the tab sequence so another

00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:54,169
thing is a focus indicator so Firefox

00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:58,399
has this really tame default like dashed

00:18:54,169 --> 00:19:02,369
outline for when an element is selected

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:05,909
so instead of doing that we were being

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:09,779
bolder and we went with the photon

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:12,719
button more prominent styling and again

00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:17,099
different browsers style their outlines

00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:19,469
differently and and that's why as

00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,209
especially if you work in design maybe

00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:22,769
we have a tendency okay just remove the

00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:26,519
outline it's ugly I don't like how it

00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:29,549
shows in in Chrome or in Firefox so when

00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,200
you remove an outline like here make

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,690
sure to test it properly in all

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,820
different browsers or go use a box

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,950
shadow like so we're using a box shadow

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,749
instead of using the outline just to

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:45,419
have a consistent look another thing was

00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:48,419
just using the keyboard but then being

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,940
stuck in this keyboard trap so I would

00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,009
open a panel and that panel will forever

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,249
be opened which is not a good user

00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:58,919
experience and so make sure that

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:02,429
whenever you have modal's or panels that

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,049
you always provide a key down on key

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,299
down event so we added it here to the

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,990
window action so anytime anywhere a

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,760
panel is

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,960
open you can always close it with an

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,240
escape key so another thing is so we

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,990
have really good documentation we also

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,170
have video tutorials and actually the

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,890
number one accessibility issue is the

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,059
lack of captioning so when I was like

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,950
too frustrated with a code and

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,020
everything I also worked on the

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,230
captioning so all of our video content

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:38,100
is has the nice captioning so that's

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,960
Gregg explaining how perfect email works

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,120
if also if you want to learn more about

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,340
how it actually works I really recommend

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,150
that you check out the series and the

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:52,309
subtitles okay and lastly is on the area

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:54,240
so originally so on the left hand side

00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:56,700
when you were tabbing through the

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,309
different buttons you will get to know

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,200
the profile from a URL and if you were

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:03,720
if you were in a screenreader it would

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,090
you say button load a profile from a URL

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,720
and you will have no idea that there is

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:13,020
like any other content afterwards so

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,470
what I did here is I added an area

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,660
expanded attribute so now when you tab

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,980
to the load of profile from a URL you

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,960
would say button collapsed and then you

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,290
click on it it says button expand it

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,200
okay so that makes sense okay so that's

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,870
kind of the scope of why I was able to

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,480
do in the two months and now it's like

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:40,280
I'm just going to quickly show you how

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:47,100
it looks like so this is the demo of

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:49,980
hopefully the working app so we start at

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,900
the top so there is a quite prominent

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,480
focus indicator I'm just using a tab key

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,900
to to go and select I'm gonna load a

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,620
profile from a file so the profile opens

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm tabbing and now there's the panel I

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,090
close up in escape he attempted tab

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,400
again I'm going down through everything

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,190
that can be interacted with we can use

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,530
this prominent focus indicator I can

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,960
open a side bar and I can close it and

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,309
there's the radio buttons and checkboxes

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,920
so yeah

00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,390
that is kind of not the

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,570
finish project yeah but it's definitely

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:30,780
miles from where it was two months ago

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:34,430
so now at least it's navigable it's it's

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,860
navigable and it's like a beginning of

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,330
hopefully a longer project because

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,310
there's like a ton of things that still

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:46,290
need to be fixed okay I'm just get back

00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:48,210
oh okay just this kind of got mixed up

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,460
but just to not about the area

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,340
attributes are really really cool as CSS

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,990
selectors as well so sometimes you want

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,170
to really really make sure okay I only

00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:02,880
want to style this when the button is

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,800
expanded so before here it doesn't have

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,820
this blue thing but when it's expanded

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,260
it's blue and you can like really make

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,620
sure that you're signing the right thing

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,350
by using the you know the area

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,760
absolutely it's here okay so just a

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,700
couple of tools that I use because we

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,250
always like the tools so that there's

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,010
the Gecko profiler web extension

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,980
there's the accessibility inspector so

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,680
it lives in Firefox dev tools if you

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,390
haven't checked it out yet you should

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,740
it's not enabled by default you have to

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,900
enable it because it has a little bit of

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,780
an overhead but it's really really good

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,210
way to start like checking what gets

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,690
added to the Dom because you know

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,830
sometimes you'll be surprised there's

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:53,010
also the WI area authoring practices

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,440
with design pattern so don't reinvent

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:58,140
the wheel check that you are actually

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,940
adding the right attributes and so

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,580
that's a good way to do it and then

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:07,140
there's also the oldie but goodie web

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,120
developer and add on the by Crispin

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,970
Derek that is really cool for like

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,540
checking and which which images are

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:18,000
missing all attributes maybe your

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,990
elements are in the wrong order and so

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,760
that's like really good one we also have

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:28,650
slack channel accessibility so

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,610
you ever have any questions about how to

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,620
anything about accessibility you can

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,620
find us there there's also Twitter so

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,450
sometimes we were trying to be like we

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,250
didn't know we thought like in theory

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,350
this sounds like a good solution but we

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,760
weren't sure so in those cases Twitter

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,040
was really helpful because we were able

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,500
to reach out to actual users and get

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,590
good advice and also of course there's

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,010
my team that word sometimes quite

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,800
critical but always constructive and

00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:02,140
yeah again this is a bit okay so just a

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:05,620
recap when you design your pages or apps

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:08,350
make sure to check what gets edited Adam

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,920
again accessibility inspector will help

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,200
you with that

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,150
use native HTML elements I know we try

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,530
to get fancy and design our custom

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,360
checkboxes and things like that enable

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,880
keyboard navigation so that way you can

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,370
capture power users but also people that

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,170
are not able to use a mouse or trackpad

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,620
or people that are using assistive

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:34,180
devices make sure that your elements are

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:37,270
in correct thumb order if the outline is

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,560
not prominent enough which by default

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,180
often isn't

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,740
make sure to custom style your focus

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,870
indicators and also of course make sure

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:51,280
you tested cross browser cross browsers

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:53,230
and also of course there's Aria and so

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,220
lastly just before a finish purr for

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,290
everyone so if you haven't checked it

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,740
out yet perf is a really cool project

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:05,770
and we are very friendly and welcoming

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,230
community we also if you're new to open

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:11,470
source that's that's fine we have good

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,780
first issues and our team is always

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,870
happy to kind of like coach you through

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,850
the process of may be contributing like

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,970
push pushing your first contribution to

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,450
open-source project we live on slack so

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:29,110
look for us at Firefox dev tools on perf

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,660
Channel and obviously search for issues

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,460
label accessibility magic not just in

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,530
our project but also in github if you

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,360
just check accessibility you can start

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:41,200
fixing the web and making it

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,360
little bit less broken today and so the

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,940
slides are on my github that's Eddie

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,360
blue that's me and I also run a

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,160
nonprofit called girls code and K and K

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,160
stands for Milton Kings so it's a

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,980
nonprofit that teaches women and girls

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,770
so actually Connie is here she's our

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,960
youngest member and she traveled she

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:07,120
surprised me and that she's here

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,980
she travels and Rosalie yeah so if you

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:27,970
have any questions about girls campaign

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:30,370
you can ask Connie cool thank you yes in

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,860
the beginning you saw that component

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,410
weren't accessible that you had some

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,020
training for you to lead so that they

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,660
don't write more inaccessible components

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,770
or where you're just hunting what's

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:48,610
broaden and try to fix it right so

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,260
there's okay so our project also we're

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,000
trying to implement automated testing

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,250
and you can catch a lot of things like

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,740
that but you will never be able to fix

00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,169
everything if you don't manually test so

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,510
I would suggest that you try not to use

00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,640
your mouse while you use your project

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,150
and you will like you spot it

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,580
immediately and you can also use on Mac

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,160
OS you have voiceover you have screen

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,169
readers like NVDA they're free and so

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,320
just by using that like even blow your

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,850
mind like it's so hard if you don't have

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,549
the right actually like if you don't

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,590
have area there if you have a div that's

00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,360
supposed to be a button but it doesn't

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,770
give you a roll of a button you will

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,710
never know that you're supposed to click

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:32,940
it and like so manual testing I think is

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,940
the way to go short

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,270
so the these last few years I've been

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,290
interested a lot in semantic web so

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,810
basically our DFA and Jason le and so on

00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,600
you see more and more UI elements been

00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,760
also implemented or sorry described

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,970
using json-ld for example you can

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,340
indicate to Google for example that

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,070
didn't put a search bar things like that

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,610
I wondered if you knew if there were

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,550
also plans to have access accessibility

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,380
features that are directly implemented

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,750
in semantic web that would basically

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,840
allow somebody to you have kind of the

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:27,510
W's between oh if it's already in

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,500
structured data then you can also use it

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:34,140
for the purpose of accessibility the

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,910
thing is when you use a native HTML

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,980
element so for example if you use input

00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:44,640
and and you say it's I don't know text

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,990
area the accessibility tree will already

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,850
know what it is

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:52,800
so inputs buttons select if you use

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,830
these elements you will get the

00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,970
accessibility functionality for free and

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,070
the only thing that you need to do is

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,040
and by enhancing that with area

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,150
attributes so and I think this is kind

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,530
of where we are at the moment so

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,980
everyone is like very hot and

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,980
