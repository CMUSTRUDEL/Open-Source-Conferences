Intro to the devroom. 

Room: UB2.252A (Lameere)
Scheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:00:00+01

	00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,800
so welcome to deaf room we have the

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,620
third monitoring deaf room in a row

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,990
we've had the largest or second largest

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,150
room every single year and i recused

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,850
myself from all different assignments

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,769
for obvious reasons still we managed to

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,830
completely fill up this room several

00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,199
times during the day so this is just

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,599
awesome and shows how much interest in

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,460
that topic exists and also it goes to

00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:38,120
show that if you're interested in like

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,739
to say like 70% of those talks chances

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,059
are you do not want to leave else you

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,320
might not get a space anymore

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:47,870
but that's your drug so I'd like to

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,690
especially thank Ben Kochi who is not

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,070
yet here Carl who is also not here and

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,400
Fabio and Shraddha who is making sure

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,799
that the door doesn't bang all the time

00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,989
you will be seeing us a few times around

00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:04,670
and seeing and and doing stuff so let's

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,470
quickly go through the content of course

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,330
I know we have this online I know it

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,530
just broke because we had to switch out

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,930
a speaker last minute so Penta barf and

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,200
I didn't match you fix it yet anyway

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:22,340
we'll start with Rosario who will be

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,490
talking about statics and civics is kind

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,210
of hopefully we will start with him but

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,180
in my mind this is like the best last

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,070
gen monitoring system on earth and it

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,670
literally kept my sanity for almost

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,530
decade

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,310
if I hadn't had civics I would probably

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,620
be in jail or or something then we have

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,040
Simona mine ality I hope I'd get those

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,320
names right with augmented network

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,500
visibility and high resolution matrix so

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,360
we're talking like second metric second

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,540
resolution so we are not or he is not

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,750
delving into microbursts but into pearls

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,030
so and this is also already really

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,360
really useful to just see do you have

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,490
like the full pipe for half a second or

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,709
maybe two seconds course this can

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,599
already massively hurt your your

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,180
performance of pretty much any

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,790
application and it at least gives you

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,830
some hopefully way to detect

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,110
if you had my Christmas those are even

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,739
worse especially when you have any

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,700
storage system then we have jvd Janna

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:30,079
Dogen critical path analysis I'd like to

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,209
say I like to say that there is only

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,670
very few ways to actually think about

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,579
what observability is and what matters

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,590
in monitoring and going through the

00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:41,150
critical path of your applications and

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,730
of your user stories of what your users

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,560
are actually trying to do is one of the

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,590
best one course it identifies all those

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,090
really really important bits and pieces

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,940
which might not be immediately obvious

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,930
only obvious there's Carlin he also get

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,030
to thank you then we have myself I'm

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,819
standing in for priyanka sharma course

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,090
she had visa issues which just goes to

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,269
show that visa sucks and diversity also

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,639
has some unseen challenges to it or

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,549
unseen to to at least anyone who's white

00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,440
and European passport and no problem

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,319
with all the things but others have

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,629
issues so yeah that kind of sucks she

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,849
couldn't make it so I'll be having a

00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,650
full talk initially it was planned for

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,900
me to open the staff room with just like

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,150
a short version of this talk now I'm

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,220
doing the full one

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,190
then we have Tom Bucky who's going to

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,129
talk about Loki which basically takes

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,590
the the metadata system and the label

00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:43,010
system of Prometheus and use it for logs

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,349
which is not full-text search like for

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,930
example you would have with Splunk or

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,269
elk stack but on the other hand it's

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,699
scales way better and it costs way less

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,530
so it's it's a good point to be in

00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,230
between and you should definitely have a

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,680
look at that one then we have someone

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:04,519
with a real good surname it's the same

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,269
of man about so if you want to do Layton

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,280
sees is the classical like ninety nine

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,680
ninety five is the correct thing to do

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,269
is it always the correct thing to do

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,680
when do you want to do something

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,099
differently and all these kinds of

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,870
considerations come into play then we've

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,739
got drop Skellington who works at uber

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,900
so he did

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:29,360
uber for four metrics M 3 DB is their

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,110
internal stuff which they've been

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,350
working on

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,910
for a few years now and it it's quite

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,460
interesting to be honest it's it's

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,920
similar to all the other like

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,670
current-gen metric things but it's

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,340
pretty interesting in a network so then

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,010
we have who I am

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,210
their mom I hope that is somewhat

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:57,440
correct at least talking about how to do

00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,890
monitoring for tour without exposing

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,680
users to to surveillance course

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,630
obviously you kind of want to avoid

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,180
identifying users on tour networks on

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,970
the other hand especially as people are

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,520
anonymous you need to kind of have good

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,310
visibility into into how the system runs

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,920
and this is this trade-off that's what

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,830
he's going to talk about then we have

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Peter site safe who's going to show us

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,320
the eb PF exporter of cloud layer and

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,420
also talk a little bit about what eb PF

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,790
does and how to get new information out

00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,380
of your linux systems of course this is

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,110
kind of game changer with inland

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,520
exclusive jessica in some places a lot

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,000
deeper information than you could get

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,070
before and a lot more consistent then

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,020
we've got Bartek he will be talking

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,550
about Sana's which basically takes

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,090
normal Prometheus which normally is a

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,280
single binary it's it runs as one one

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,590
single thing and basically it takes a

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,630
storage and it pull it out put it put it

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,540
out into object storage which allows you

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,820
to do all kinds of neat things and he'll

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,190
be talking about that one

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,790
then we've got metal mats and cell reuse

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,250
Albany talking about kubernetes

00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,650
and how to how to do monitoring off

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,400
coronet is with primitives for those who

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,950
don't know kubernetes and Prometheus

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,350
very wouldn't be as big if the other one

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,810
didn't exist course they are in a very

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,280
very tight in the dependency I mean

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,640
Prometheus doesn't really depend on

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,350
kubernetes but the rush of kubernetes

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,290
propelled for me to forward but you

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,820
couldn't really be running kubernetes

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,370
unless you had some monitoring which

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,740
does labels so this is why they're

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,030
really closely coupled those who are

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,200
really really good at what they do so

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,320
we'll be seeing a lot of that

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,970
stuff once more if the next speaker is

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,860
here you can come up and prepare of

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,910
course we would like to switch over in

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,540
like two minutes

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,750
yes exactly two minutes then we have

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,600
something about James James Shubin about

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,630
trying to take your monitoring data and

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,880
act on this automatically so get nearer

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:10,240
to this to this holy goal of of

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,350
self-healing systems then Hannes Juarez

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
about what makes sense to have

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,880
centralized logs and not just have bits

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
and pieces and silos of your data in

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,750
small islands of your data and then have

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,340
fun with with trying to to discern

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,340
anything especially in Incident Response

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,970
last we have Ilya I enough on writing as

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,010
synchronous SNMP agents SNMP for those

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:38,870
who don't know is pure distilled pain it

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:41,150
sucks and you still have to use it then

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,330
we have monitoring for Internet of

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,600
Things and how you can tie MQTT and all

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,780
those things into a monitoring story and

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:54,140
finally we have make the Thrilla how to

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,930
how to do LDAP monitoring there's a few

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,840
things I'd like to say if you see trash

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,580
don't care if it's yours take it with

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,160
you take it outside

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,870
don't put it into these put it back in

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,610
those trash cans not those because

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,730
things are always full please take it to

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,070
those trash cans and also please respect

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,530
the speakers they're doing this mostly

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,090
their own free time some even travel on

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,360
their own money to come here and speak

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,600
we want to maximize well you an 800 Q

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,790
time but whatever so and for us to

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,760
maximize Q and a we really need you to

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,680
be quiet you can you can enter you can

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,260
leave no problem but be quiet if you're

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,729
not quiet we will shout you down this is

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,170
not because we're evil does this because

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,180
it's about respect for the people who

00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,620
invest their time to do this thank you

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,930
very much and if we have the speaker

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,440
then I'd like him to come up and if not

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,440
