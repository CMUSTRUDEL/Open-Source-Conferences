A tour on newest and future developments for gtk-rs, the Rust bindings to GTK+. Agenda

Introduction: 


Small presentation of Gtk-rs project.
Small code demonstration.



Last year developments: 


Add of futures to handle asynchronous function calls.
Generation of union types.
A lot of new types/functions generated.



Next developments: 


Generate bindings for functions/methods taking callbacks as argument.
Long run: being able to "subclass" widgets.
Global API improvements as always!
Generate sys crates documentation on gtk-rs.org as well?



gtk-rs ecosystem: 


A lot of projects are starting to use gtk-rs, two of them are part of the ten most active GNOME projects on gitlab (Fractal - https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal - and Podcasts - https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Podcasts).
Some (nice) API are built upon it like relm (https://github.com/antoyo/relm).
