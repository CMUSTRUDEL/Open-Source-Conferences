The long-term success of a FOSS project depends on the “on-ramp” experience - the documentation, support, and opportunities available to help new users and participants come up to speed. Students can be a good source of new participants for FOSS projects, which can provide valuable opportunities for students to learn technologies and develop key skills in communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving. This session will explore the structure and findings of activities designed to help students identify and explore FOSS projects, and consider ways to improve the on-ramp experience for new participants. Active, diverse communities are essential to develop and support FOSS projects. Research shows that most participants start as users and gradually become more engaged, but that only a small fraction of users advance to become active community members. Thus, the long-term success of a FOSS project depends on the “on-ramp” (or “slip road”) experience - the documentation, support, and opportunities available to help new users and participants come up to speed and join the community. This can be particularly important for people who are non-developers or from underrepresented groups (by gender, ethnicity, language, etc) who may experience “imposter syndrome”.
Students can be a good source of new participants for FOSS projects, which can provide valuable opportunities for students to learn technologies and develop key skills in communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving. However, FOSS is often quite different from traditional academic experiences. Thus, the Professors Open Source Software Experience (POSSE) is a multi-stage program to help faculty understand how FOSS communities work, and how to help students participate effectively in FOSS communities. POSSE includes a “FOSS Field Trip” activity which explores sites like SourceForge and GitHub to discover projects of interest, and a “Project Evaluation” activity which uses a rubric to explore a specific project and assess how welcoming it is for new participants.
In this interactive session, I will briefly present these two activities and summarize what students and faculty experience when they explore unfamiliar FOSS projects. In small groups, participants will consider the strengths and possible improvements of specific FOSS projects. I will then facilitate a discussion of broader insights, and ways that FOSS communities, faculty, and students can work together to improve the on-ramp experience for new participants.

so thank you very much for coming cliff

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:11,270
and we're looking forward you're talking

00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,590
great thank you pretty better give me a

00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,200
fake

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:20,380
[Applause]

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,779
okay so mostly I want to talk about why

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:26,020
it's important to think about how new

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,099
people come into your community to get

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,380
there I want to give you a little

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:42,190
background as to why that's something I

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:44,100
care deeply about or not so I I'm kind

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,750
of a jack of all trades master of none

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,210
I've done product development I've done

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,500
consulting I've worked with Fox

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,780
collaboration tools right now most of my

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,510
focus is I guess you would call open

00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,870
education resources so I'm involved in

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,850
two major projects one focused on

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,729
helping faculty and students get

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,920
involved in Foss for humanitarian

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,530
purposes that's the open path project

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,149
and the other is something called Pagal

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:18,640
which is a very particular style of

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:21,490
classroom learning that helps students

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,470
practice the skills they'll need in in

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,120
open source projects so I want to

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,240
acknowledge support from the US National

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:34,000
Science Foundation from Google for

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,590
helping us do that kind of work on the

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,710
Foss side again sort of

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,780
jack-of-all-trades master of none mostly

00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,340
I've been working with collaboration

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,020
tools wiki's content management systems

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,299
Moodle obviously it's a professor a

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,720
little bit of music lots of different

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:56,560
things so my goals with Foss have really

00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,490
changed over time I started using Foss

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,490
before Foss was a term then my goal was

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:06,659
really to use software to solve problems

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,610
I had or that researchers around me had

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,939
then in about 2000 I started working

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,430
with global development teams and doing

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:18,099
some consulting with us so using Foss

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,069
tools to help businesses solve their

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,900
problems a bit later I came back to

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:28,500
academia and now I started thinking how

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,019
we use these tools in education right I

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,810
realized that students needed more

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,510
experience and Foss tools could be a way

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,720
to do it how can I get students involved

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,620
in this and then kind of the the most

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,840
recent shift has been realizing we

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,239
really need to think much more carefully

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,299
about how we train students and how we

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,670
help them think about things and to be

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,010
honest I'm kind of uncomfortable in a

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,519
lecture setting this would never happen

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,400
in one of my classrooms but more about

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:09,750
that later so why is this something I

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:18,569
think is really important oh I can't

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:21,120
move around got it I understood thank

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,650
you sorry in my classroom I would be

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,180
walking all over the place making the

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,340
people in the back feel uncomfortable so

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,560
so this this is a quote from a marvelous

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,660
book by De Marco and Lister the book is

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,290
people where the quote is the major

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,750
problems of our work are not so much

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,370
technological as sociological right we

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,940
spend an awful lot of time talking about

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,639
tools and technologies that's the easy

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,280
part right the hard part is getting

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,409
people to work together keeping track of

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,280
who's doing what all of these all of

00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:59,120
these other things that's what I as an

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,409
educator what we as an academic

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:08,909
organizations should be really focused

00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:12,599
on a lot more so when I talk about

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,010
skills I'm mostly talking about these

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,190
things some people call them

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,199
professional skills but not just

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,579
professionals need them some people call

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,440
them soft skills

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,460
I would actually argue they're harder

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,070
than the hard skills so my community

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,680
often calls them processed skills skills

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,900
and the way you work so we talk about

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,520
information processing critical thinking

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,699
all of these skills I just

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,620
added a few examples of how these skills

00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:47,810
play out in software development and so

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,810
my argument when I work with faculty is

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,110
to say these skills are actually a lot

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,130
more important to your students than

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,889
whatever you think you're teaching them

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,099
about software engineering compilers

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,419
chemistry right I tell my students half

00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:05,360
of what you learn your first year is

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,340
gonna be obsolete when you graduate if

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,349
you don't have these skills you can work

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:16,820
for two years and you'll have an

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:20,240
obsolete skill set so the the sort of

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,699
thesis of my talk is that every

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,080
computing student should be contributing

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,380
to open source and even further every

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,800
student at any institution could

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,650
contribute to open source so how many of

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:43,370
you contributed to open source projects

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:46,070
as students Wow much less than I would

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,370
have guessed okay the people that were

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,310
students how many people knew other

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:58,099
students at your institution that were

00:05:52,310 --> 00:06:04,310
also involved in open source comment it

00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:10,699
at your University within your

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:12,259
university know a few how many we're at

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,539
universities were over half of the

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:20,419
students in computing contributed to

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:24,500
open source a few okay so that's that's

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:26,870
really where I want to go so one of the

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,490
things we did was we started thinking

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,460
about what are all the ways you could

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,840
get involved in open source those of you

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,270
that are old enough to remember the Paul

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,020
Simon song 50 ways to leave your lover

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,639
we came up with 50 ways to be a foster

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,610
there's a recording somewhere that we've

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,980
hidden for legal reasons

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,430
but the point is we very quickly came up

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:53,760
with over a hundred ways that a student

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,460
with sometimes lots of competing

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,560
background sometimes no computing

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,520
background could get involved in an

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,690
open-source project make contributions

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,240
do interesting things

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,710
I think that's really important to think

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,930
about so what why why should students

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,890
participate in open source kind of

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,890
interested in what people think

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,120
okay useful job skills certainly ah

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:40,410
connections it's awesome what was the

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,000
last word

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,000
learn from others collaboration yes

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,750
right so not just code that gets run

00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:07,330
once and then deleted forever but code

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:16,090
that's used for a long time get your

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:29,560
dissertation Benton learned how to deal

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:32,469
with him right

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,169
often in academia the assignment is very

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:39,039
specific all of the tricky parts have

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,219
been carefully mapped out open sources

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,219
messy

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,980
yes absolutely but I mean it's absurd

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,930
right if you were learning a foreign

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:09,720
language would you learn to speak before

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:10,920
you learn to listen right exposure to

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,690
different technologies and different

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,690
approaches not just technologies yeah

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,090
yes right so so lots of good reasons

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,460
so is interesting all the reasons we

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,780
talked about were reasons that help

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,180
students there are also benefits to

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,270
faust projects and their benefits I

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,160
would argue to society more generally

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:44,070
right so that the community I'm in is

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,330
particularly focused on getting students

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:52,200
involved in humanitarian projects

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,790
disaster management medical records we

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,890
have a group starting to work on food

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,470
banks when for areas where people don't

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,180
have enough food to eat that's actually

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,230
a problem on a lot of campuses in the

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:10,440
u.s. so there are lots of benefits there

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:12,870
to think about but another reason to try

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,720
to bring more people in is to grow the

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,330
community the kinds of people that that

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,980
are involved in open source right so we

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,220
heard a little bit about this from

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,220
speakers earlier today right we want

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,230
more different people more different

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,980
perspectives more different ideas in our

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,470
projects unfortunately that often means

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,560
we need more women because we're in a

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,360
dock in a profession that at least in

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,770
some countries is very male-dominated

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,890
not all so so we want to increase these

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:49,200
underrepresented groups why well I think

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,600
there are actually several reasons one

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,630
is there are historic problems we want

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,950
to try to overcome we want to have more

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,870
people

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,420
capable of doing these kinds of jobs

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,870
it's good for the people it's good for

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,810
society but even if you didn't care

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,520
about that it's a better it's better for

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,770
the product right the more different

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:16,530
perspectives the more different ideas

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,000
the better you're gonna be I don't want

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,890
to have a whole talk about how to do

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,560
that but I do want to point out that

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:26,400
most of the practices that help these

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,280
groups actually help everyone right sage

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,020
gave a great talk earlier I'm sorry it

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,280
wasn't a great talk it was a talk that

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,620
inspired and motivated me many of the

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,680
things that help people suffering from

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,900
impostor syndrome will help everyone in

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,680
the community right it's like the

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,480
argument about wheelchair ramps it's

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,740
nice if you have a wheelchair if you've

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,070
been a parent and you're pushing a

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,650
stroller it's nice if it's icy and you

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,660
don't want to slip it's nice if you're

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,660
up on the fifth floor of a building and

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,400
the lift isn't working that's a problem

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,980
for everyone not just not just some

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,930
people so the more we can do these

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,230
things the more we can help the larger

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,380
audience um there's actually a little

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:17,220
bit of data to support this so this was

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,040
a study students participated in a

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,230
humanitarian open-source project at the

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,020
end of the course

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:28,410
63 said it 63% said it caused me to

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:31,980
consider this is a major 77 percent said

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,070
it reinforced my decision 52 percent

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,480
said it caused me to take more courses

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:41,130
what's interesting though is the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,620
students with less experience got a much

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,090
bigger benefit from it right the

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,220
students that already knew they wanted

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,490
to major it wasn't going to change their

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,130
mind the students that weren't sure the

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,660
students that were less confident the

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,720
students that might have been suffering

00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:03,270
from impostor syndrome big big

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:07,760
difference there so we talked a lot in

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:10,130
in Foss about icebergs and how you

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,220
the people we see the public face of the

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,300
projects are hiding a much larger

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,130
community that's doing a lot of the work

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,680
but I also want to think about this as

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,399
the students we see involved in open

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,690
source are also the tip of the iceberg

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,550
often they're the students that are most

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:33,620
passionate that had some connection that

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,829
had privilege in that they had the time

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,420
to get involved they had more background

00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:43,100
we want to try to bring all these other

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,050
people into our communities too so how

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,750
do we do this well people have studied

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,730
this right the general idea is that a

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,610
community starts with lots of people

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,339
that maybe use the product maybe just

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,680
watch and think about it a small number

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,410
of then become users a small number then

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:06,199
become contributors eventually you work

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:08,600
your way up this is not data that I have

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,199
any source for but I would argue that

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:18,230
this is actually optimistic 90% passive

00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:20,180
users 0.01% core team so what do we want

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,060
to do we want to find ways to help

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,029
people move up this progression and get

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,920
involved knowing that they're going to

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,089
go in other directions too right people

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,889
are going to be involved for a little

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,690
while they're going to switch to another

00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,420
project they're going to lose interest

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,730
they're gonna run out of time and have

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,810
to back off those are all good things

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:45,170
that's all okay so we often talk about

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,610
this as a pyramid model and I think

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:52,310
that's okay but the problem with a

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,010
pyramid is it takes a lot of work to

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,560
climb up to the top and I would like to

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:01,910
suggest instead we should be thinking

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:05,329
about open source contributors as a

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,970
sales funnel right we're trying to take

00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,709
people that are aware of our products in

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,319
this case an open source project and

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:14,630
have them get more interested than have

00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:18,050
them start thinking about using it using

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:20,420
it taking action take someone that is

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,209
aware that this is open source they're

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,189
interested in

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:28,769
tributing they think about contributing

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:30,869
they actually contribute we don't want

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,970
to force people to climb the pyramid to

00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:35,939
get involved in our project we want to

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,759
lead them through a funnel so they can

00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:41,069
get involved more easily

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,379
that's the scarce resource it's the time

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:47,639
and attention to people anything we can

00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,170
do to help them do that is a way okay so

00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,119
what are the challenges what makes this

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,119
difficult why don't all students do this

00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:05,429
limited-time absolutely actually I was

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,459
talking to someone yesterday who said in

00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:10,199
Europe it's actually easier because many

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,170
european students don't need as much

00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,360
money to pay for colleges as American

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,970
students do American students are

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,249
rushing to graduate they're working the

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,050
30 hours a week while they're taking

00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:24,050
classes it's very difficult

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:14,390
see lots of nodding heads yeah don't

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,390
even know it's an option

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,039
[Music]

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,230
right so I when you said lack of

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,830
resources I wasn't sure which resources

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,260
you meant yes so so things that help new

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:46,120
people get involved and become active in

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:50,230
the project you talked about most of

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,720
these I think another challenge is just

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,590
finding a project you want to contribute

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,120
to right I think very few people wake up

00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,980
and say oh you know the Linux kernel

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,240
that's something I've always wanted to

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,460
work on let me just go dive in right

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,290
again the data shows people start using

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:13,510
a project I was a music major I started

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,850
using musescore it does great stuff

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:20,650
there's one thing I wish it did that it

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,450
doesn't quite do so I figure out how to

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,000
use this ticket system and request

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,310
something nobody acts on my request for

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,380
a year and so I start trying to do it

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,970
myself

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:37,510
right so helping students get through

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:39,340
these processes is a challenge what

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,380
about the challenges for faculty if

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:48,660
faculty want to help their students get

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:48,660
involved in open source time

00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,969
finding suitable projects

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,160
right not having that back contact or

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,520
connection so actually a lot of the

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,280
problems are similar right most faculty

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,530
have never they used open-source

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,570
probably whether they realize it or not

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,940
most of them have never contributed many

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,270
have never used the tools the open

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,910
source communities use there are also

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,980
curricular issues faculty feel like oh I

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,810
have to cover the book is this thick

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,970
I've got to cover this much of the book

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,970
every day how am I going to find time

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:45,500
for all this other stuff

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:48,380
so I'm part of a large group of people

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,330
that are working to make this better the

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,610
sort of umbrella organization is a site

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,500
called teaching open source which is a

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,900
member of the software freedom

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,960
Conservancy so our goal is really

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,590
training and supporting faculty so that

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,930
they can then support students to get

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,770
more students involved in these projects

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:11,450
for all the reasons we've talked about

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,790
so we train the faculty we build

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,000
community we build resources they can

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,280
use and we try to connect faculty and

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,330
communities where it seems like there

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,110
are there are good fits one of the

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:29,810
things we do is a is a workshop program

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:33,110
for faculty called Posse the professors

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:36,500
open source software experience this was

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:39,770
started by Red Hat I believe back in the

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,590
day and Red Hat has been a enthusiastic

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:46,280
supporter all along the basic ideas

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,800
faculty spend a month or two doing

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,580
independent work we try to introduce

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,650
them to tools like IRC and wiki's then

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,820
they come together for three days of

00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:00,220
intensive work partly learning tools

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,160
partly connecting with communities

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,560
partly thinking about the pedagogy how

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,930
would I use this in my class how do I

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,480
get my students involved and then we

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,820
hope they can go on from there and use

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,390
this in their classes get their students

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,010
involved and do new things so we've

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,590
we've run these events all over the

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,180
world we've done a bunch it at Red Hat

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,060
and Raleigh they've been very generous

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:32,770
with space we did one in Bologna Italy

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:35,840
we did one in Google in San Francisco

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,270
we're trying to get as many faculty as

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,970
we can thinking about using these

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,550
approaches another side of what we're

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,070
doing is is developing classroom

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,550
materials often these are materials we

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,940
first have the faculty use so the

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,430
faculty experience what it's like

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,050
faculty also feel impostor syndrome

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,610
right I'm new to this community I don't

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,420
really know what's going on but I'm the

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,140
professor I'm supposed to be the expert

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,620
what do I do

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,430
it's it's very hard for a professor even

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,860
though they're in a position of

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,630
authority to admit to their students I

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,630
don't know the answer to this question

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:21,380
so we have a collection of materials

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,800
some are very polished some are very

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,630
rough we're trying to move those forward

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,890
this is part of our team at the the

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:33,170
Google workshop we did so I want to just

00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,960
walk you through one of the activities

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:39,830
that really I think will help you think

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:42,380
about this onboarding process what could

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,890
projects do to help students get on

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,320
board

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:49,310
what can faculty do to help make those

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,040
connections so this is a an activity we

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,400
do to evaluate a project that you might

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,160
want to join and get involved in so we

00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,960
have some overview information this is

00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,330
mostly for the teachers reference not

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,920
the students reference right you're

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,120
going to look at a project we're going

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,460
to look at a set of different

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,640
characteristics decide whether this is a

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,750
good approach so we have some background

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,020
and we're trying to give very clear

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:21,200
step-by-step directions right students

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,390
especially students that are not the

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,090
very strongest most confident students

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,540
it's easy for them to get lost and

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,010
confused if you say oh well go learn how

00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,520
to use get figure out where the

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,770
repository is

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,559
but you've lost most of them already so

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,350
we're trying to be very systematic so we

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,920
have a rubric with a set of factors to

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,590
look for and then sort of scoring to

00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,080
help decide is this a project that I

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,590
want to contribute to is this a project

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,630
that maybe I should stay away from so

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,540
just as one example if we were looking

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,030
at the community norms right students

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,640
don't know what community norms are so

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,850
first we explain a little bit about what

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,640
the norms mean then we say see if you

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,059
can find a code of conduct maybe you can

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,940
do it

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:14,880
maybe you can't depends on the project

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,190
then go into the forums and look for

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,190
some actual conversations and

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,470
interactions don't just look for a post

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,170
in a response look for something where

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:28,740
there is some back-and-forth maybe some

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,840
disagreement what did you see were

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,720
people being constructive and respectful

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,640
and supportive or were there people

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:41,700
being arrogant and obnoxious and rude

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:46,170
look at that think of that as one factor

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,820
to consider so you need to think about

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,350
licensing you need to think about the

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,380
languages you need to think about the

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,530
size of the project you need to think

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,450
about how active the project is right

00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,730
sometimes for academics it's actually

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,460
good to find a project that's almost

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:05,790
dead because it doesn't change so

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,500
quickly other times you want a project

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,140
with lots of people and lots of change

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,800
happening so you want to look at at

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,750
these different factors again they come

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,820
back to the rubric this has them

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,640
thinking about all these different

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,370
considerations either as a faculty

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,150
member choosing a project that all my

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,679
students are going to work on or as a

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,140
single student or a small group of

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,650
students trying to choose a project that

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,650
they're gonna work

00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:43,270
how much time do I have awesome so I

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,010
want to end just with with some

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,460
suggestions and leave some time for

00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:50,790
discussion and questions I guess the

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,710
first thing I would say to a project is

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:57,210
think about how much you can do to

00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:00,580
support teachers and students right a

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,310
professor if they're bringing their

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,960
class into your project they need that

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,330
point of contact they need someone to

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,900
talk to if you don't have the time to

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,810
help them please tell them upfront if

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,780
you do have time to help them make sure

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:21,730
they know who to talk to make sure they

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:25,120
know what they can expect please look at

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,800
your processes and documentation you'd

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,520
be surprised how often the install

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,740
instructions are six months or two or

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,040
three years out of date they only work

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,960
on a particular operating system they

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,510
only work if you already understand how

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,020
to follow them that's not so helpful for

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:47,020
new contributors some projects do this I

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:51,640
wish more would flag the tasks that you

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:54,130
think a new contributor could do that's

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,890
an easy task for the community it's a

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,170
very difficult task for a student or a

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,350
faculty member I don't know your project

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,710
I can guess which tasks are easy I don't

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:09,010
really know the last thing I would say

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:12,760
is first impressions matter right if the

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:17,110
first interaction doesn't go well it's

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,940
probably over on both sides so faculty

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,490
and student I mean part of what we do as

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,950
faculty is try to coach students on how

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,660
to approach the community we're hoping

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:30,220
the communities are thinking about how

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,620
best to approach the students - so I

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,580
will stop there I would love to take

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:38,920
questions or share ideas and I would

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,110
love to hear from people or talk to

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,810
people going forward thank you thanks

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,800
all right folks we know applause is

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,800
great I was wrong applause

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:56,570
so folks I think we have time for about

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,100
three or four questions so we are

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:04,730
excited to hear your questions and

00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:06,550
welcome them and Brian I think there's

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,630
space for you to get started setting up

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,600
thank you very much

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:16,360
two questions but one very quick how can

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,880
I set an open-source course in my Paris

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,970
University if I want to do the same that

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,180
you do in San Francisco in the American

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,850
University in Paris how do I do that

00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,190
become a teacher of false so if you want

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,970
to run one of the workshops for faculty

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:50,660
yes in Paris talk to me okay I'll come

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:53,300
it helps if you have money but thank you

00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,800
and the the second one is a I worked in

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,960
a French company which is an electrical

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,390
company and we jumped to open-source

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,120
because our R&D has a lot of line of

00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,370
codes so for climate change energy

00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,350
transition we are trying to jump to open

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,810
source and we hire a lot of people

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,760
inside and we push the code on github

00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,830
but it's not sufficient to ramp the

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,830
project how do we around the project

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,159
I think that's gonna be a hard question

00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:25,080
to answer in 30 seconds let's talk later

00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:33,210
yeah hire an established community

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:35,330
manager who can help you thank you for

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,009
being patient here you go

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,350
so I think this is really good you've

00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:43,379
given some great examples for projects

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,110
what they can do to tag you've given

00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:48,990
some great suggestions for students my

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:53,580
experience is that when a student comes

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,289
in to a project they they're trying to

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,820
contribute but there's a lot of labor

00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,860
involved for the project so there's a

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,299
lot of intellectual labor because

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,070
usually the you know there's a lot of

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,659
work to do for any new contributor no

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,249
matter what and then there's emotional

00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,669
labor especially if it's new contributor

00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,669
