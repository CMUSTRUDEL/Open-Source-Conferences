Oracle donated NetBeans to Apache in 2016. What's the status of the project, what's the roadmap, and how can you get involved? 

In this talk we will show what NetBeans has for the future. This includes how to experiment with new Java language features in NetBeans, how to develop OpenJDK with NetBeans and how to add a support for a new language to NetBeans based the language server protocol.
