Oracle donated NetBeans to Apache in 2016. What's the status of the project, what's the roadmap, and how can you get involved? 

In this talk we will show what NetBeans has for the future. This includes how to experiment with new Java language features in NetBeans, how to develop OpenJDK with NetBeans and how to add a support for a new language to NetBeans based the language server protocol.

so I want to briefly introduce the

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,430
background where NetBeans was where it's

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,800
going where it is and my colleague yang

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,670
will do a demo of some of the new

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:27,310
support for LSP and related editor

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:32,289
functionality so the story of NetBeans

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,850
begins in the 90s in well before being

00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,789
part of Sun Microsystems a group of

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,539
students in prayer and created an IDE

00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:42,850
for this cool new language called Java

00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,589
it was quired by sun and was free and

00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,260
open source pretty much from the

00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:50,199
beginning and what was a way for sun to

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,050
position java and to provide a low

00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,889
threshold entry point and into getting

00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:00,399
into the java ecosystem and it was

00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:02,620
really fully controlled by sun but at

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,290
the same time there was this vision of

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,299
having a community around it so there

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,710
were two in particular two organizations

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,869
one called netcat so this wasn't

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,969
NetBeans community acceptance testing

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:15,820
program and also something called the

00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:18,939
NetBeans Dream Team so these were these

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,619
were evangelists and and external people

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,549
from outside some who were talking about

00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:26,740
NetBeans and so on and and increasingly

00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,990
the focus of Nephi has changed to be

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,729
more than just Java it became more

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,829
generically focused on the number of

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,450
different languages and as this

00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,649
community was being built they wanted to

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,869
have more and more say over the

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,700
direction of the project so had this

00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,090
community of people from all over the

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,490
world

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,310
we were not attached to Sun but you were

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,600
really attached to to NetBeans and they

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,340
wanted to be more involved and it was

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,320
this constant push from the community

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,060
saying hey we don't want to simply file

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,619
issues we want to actually be involved

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,630
in the project in the direction in the

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,840
roadmap we want to really be engaged in

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,469
this so there was a constant friction

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,030
between those two different interests

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,399
and so then of course there was the

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,110
acquisition of Sun by Oracle and

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,460
NetBeans was simply part of that

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,610
acquisition was one of the many

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:17,930
different products that went into Oracle

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,280
and the the question was of course

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,080
you know erica was invested in

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,240
JDeveloper and is invested in eclipse

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,450
and now has NetBeans so obviously

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,970
NetBeans is going to fall out of that

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,190
step with an Oracle and I'm I work for

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,810
Erica I was working for Sun and

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,940
definitely we were concerned about this

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,650
too but quite quickly it was clear that

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,020
NetBeans was being used in different

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,120
places within Oracle and JDeveloper

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,600
itself became real architected to have

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,630
its its module system it's it's

00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,310
bootstrap system became we are connected

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,890
on top of NetBeans remember of features

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,300
from NetBeans ended up in JDeveloper so

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,440
for example the GUI builder from

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,400
NetBeans and went to was was reused in

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,590
JDeveloper and the profiler from

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,030
NetBeans was reused in JDeveloper so

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,810
there was all kinds of needs within

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,489
Oracle for NetBeans at the same time

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,010
there was this kind of shift in the

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,380
technology world from on the one hand

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,750
sure job is great but javascript is also

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,300
great and Oracle has grown in that

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,500
direction like anyone else I suppose so

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,810
on the front end so the folks

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,670
increasingly with the NetBeans became

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,730
not only Java but also JavaScript to

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,989
support that technology change in the

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,519
industry and the question was asked at

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,239
some point look we have this very strong

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,799
community they want to be more involved

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,610
auricles core business is not providing

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,989
tools so it doesn't make sense to put

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,019
NetBeans in a place where the community

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,290
can more easily get involved because a

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,390
blocker for people contributing code to

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,070
NetBeans was had to sign an Oracle

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,810
license agreements which basically meant

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,820
giving all the code away to Oracle and

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,609
that was always a blocker and also their

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,049
idea concern for many people was well

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:02,900
why should I contribute to something

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,390
that belongs to Oracle doesn't Oracle

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,829
have enough engineers to to correct the

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,959
features that are needed why should I

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:12,200
have to commit to something they're just

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,989
actually Oracle's so at some point so

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,209
this was in 2016 the decision was made

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,640
in Oracle hey we need to you know we

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,859
need to put NetBeans in us in a in a

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,200
more stable governance model in a

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,550
governance model that people more

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,640
broadly will be able to contribute to

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,860
more more easily and Apache was the one

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,379
that was chosen and

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,030
I'm really happy for that because what

00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,699
is really nice about the Apache Software

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,729
Foundation is that it focuses on

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,340
individual contributors it's all about

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,580
individual contributors everyone on the

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,039
mailing list is equal and when we vote

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:53,139
every single vote is equal there are no

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:55,289
companies attached to Apache projects no

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,599
company can have a dominant

00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,800
say in any of these discussions and so

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,349
on so it's all individuals which is

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,810
exactly how NetBeans has been working in

00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:06,699
all those years so then this decision

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,310
was made we want to share the cost of

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,400
ownership we want to put NetBeans in a

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,189
governance model that is that suits bit

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,840
which is Apache we don't simply want to

00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,969
put NetBeans for example on github

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,310
because then you have discussions about

00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,659
governance essentially so the good thing

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,449
about Apache as you get the small

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,189
government model out of the box and and

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,279
it enables Oracle to continue to be

00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:32,800
involved to continue to contribute and

00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,680
in a moment I'll show the what you know

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,089
contribution who's contributing what and

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,969
so on and you see Oracle was still

00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,440
heavily involved so then that decision

00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,529
was made in October 2016

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,150
and then the question became ok what

00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:48,039
does this mean we've said we're going to

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,479
donate NetBeans to Apache but what is

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,240
NetBeans really is it

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,949
it's the code sure it's the website it's

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,990
it's this communicates that community

00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,050
it's listening to that what what exactly

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,879
are we does this donation actually mean

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,300
so we spent some months figuring out

00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,740
what what we actually meant by that and

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,659
so I'm the person with an Oracle who's

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,750
been kind of overseeing that transition

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:13,449
process in more or less enfermo capacity

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,889
and there's this discussions on the

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,169
Oracle side this discussions on the

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,300
Apache side there's a lot of auditing

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,219
because Oracle constantly say well here

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,419
is a repository good luck it belongs to

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,879
the Apache now because there could be

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,889
code in there over the last 20 years of

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,979
NetBeans existence that doesn't really

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:32,349
belong to Oracle by accident somehow so

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,689
every single file at some point had to

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,430
be audited because we discovered that or

00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,080
we realized there's a toolbar in

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,180
NetBeans with different icons for

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,729
opening different browsers one of those

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,199
browsers is the Google Chrome browser so

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,339
there's a nice little icon in there

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,190
Google's icon Google's logo is in our

00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:53,289
toolbar can we donate Google's logo to

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,789
Apache no of course not

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:57,250
then we have to look at every single

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,139
file every single picture every single

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,250
line in every single file to audit it

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,279
before we can give it to you attach it

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,740
and once it's an Apache a second process

00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,870
begins because Apache can't release GPL

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,879
code or who doesn't care attach it

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,190
deaths then the second process has to

00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,129
begin in Apache to scrub that code

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,300
removed qpo remove binary site Zulu it's

00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:22,479
a massive process we we are about 2/3 of

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,800
the way through this process we're still

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,770
in the incubator we are right now

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,629
talking about bleed in the incubator our

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,250
mentors in Apache I mean a patch is

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,919
wonderful that gives you mentors I give

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,080
you a VM they give you github they give

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,610
you a governance model out of the box

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,039
and everything we needed all the

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,039
structures are there so we simply had to

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,449
adapt to these new structures and we've

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,490
been doing really well in that sense

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,949
it's a really large project in Apache

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,190
terms it's the it's got the most lines

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:54,909
of code competing with OpenOffice

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,830
in that sense and we've done two

00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,569
releases and the incubators attached in

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,069
that means nine and ten and we have

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,649
touching it means 11 coming up in March

00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:05,949
we want to do more frequent releases and

00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:08,949
we have more or less said we want to do

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:11,379
two releases per year if you want to

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,300
commit to two releases per year and two

00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,159
optional releases in between so there

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,959
could be a minor release in between and

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,550
we've more and since we've decided to do

00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,219
two releases it makes sense to align

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,469
with something so our next release in

00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,379
March which happens to be the release of

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,300
the next JDK jelica 12 and in September

00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:31,209
which happens to be the release of

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,719
Attica 13 so we'll be in in in line with

00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:38,319
those different decades so at the same

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,979
time we're moving out of the incubator

00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:44,110
so before young there's a quick demo

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,000
this is what the NetBeans dot orab

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,770
website looked like in the past and it's

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,559
still like that we're in the process of

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,610
leaving everything to the Apache

00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,200
equivalents so this is our new website

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,420
looks much more modern and so on

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,060
it's it's quite far from being what we

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,200
wanted to be but we have the starting

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,420
point you want to make it much more

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,579
visual and graphic and show the editor

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,880
and so on but it's a much more modern

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:09,889
site clearly that we're moving content

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,110
from here to there but but here as well

00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,579
before we can leave something to the to

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,040
the Apache sites we have to have it

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:18,860
audited so our app has to donate each

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,959
and every HTML file each and every icon

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,990
each and every everything so that's the

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,420
process as well so so here's the new

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,070
site and so for example weaving tutorial

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,110
so here's an owl tutorial on knitting

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,800
store excite and here is that same

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,560
tutorial on the Apache netting site and

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,220
the best thing about it is it's now an

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
esky dog I mean logically but NetBeans

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,570
has us long history with everything in

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,690
HTML but the really cool thing is

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,459
everything is on github so if I have a

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,930
problem with this tutorial or if

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,240
something's wrong with it I can go

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,690
directly into github and do a pull

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,550
request on that tutorial and then people

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,459
can review that and so on so for the

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,589
first time we have a really nice a

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:06,320
magical way of people contributing to

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:09,230
our tutorials they can make the changes

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,610
themselves and provide for requests here

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,769
is the Apache NetBeans github repository

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,890
and we've completely restructured this

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:22,089
because we had like thousands of top

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,980
level folders was in inside NetBeans

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,320
material at Oracle with this long list

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,350
of all our modules which became

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,250
unmanageable within github so we have

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,230
reorganized those modules into different

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,579
clusters so this these are clusters of

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,019
modules and if you familiar with the

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,970
NetBeans terminology a cluster is a

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:42,529
collection of modules and this reflects

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,399
what you see in installation directory

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,540
so this is enterprise folder here you

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,670
click on here and here are all the

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,769
modules that provides the Jakarta EE

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,209
Java EE features so these are all in

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,490
github right now

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,500
so here's here all the Java modules

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,060
within a Java cluster so we've reopened

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,269
as everything to make it more manageable

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,630
so the top level folders actually quite

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,630
not that much

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,759
so here you can see who has contributed

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,589
so everything is everything is

00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,690
transparent for the first time and

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:16,120
inside inside Oracle we had like one

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,160
person doing release management for

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,139
NetBeans and that one person knew

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,120
everything about release management but

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,920
no one else knew how that one person did

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,490
it and if that person was run over by a

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,930
bus

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,389
we wouldn't have been able to release in

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,399
Apache everything is documented we'd

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:33,639
simply following Apaches release

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,889
management steps when we do a release so

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,949
it's it's really well organized and

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:40,810
transparent so here are the people who

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:45,250
have contributed since the very

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:49,149
beginning of Apache NetBeans in NetBeans

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,709
in Apache and so you can see here

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,009
younger hoda right here the most

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,319
frequent contributor from Oracle and

00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,600
then the second person 40s blessing so

00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,939
somebody from outside Oracle you need

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,560
he's in Germany somewhere you need to

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:04,420
use in Japan somewhere so these are not

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,839
Oracle people and then they are staff

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,459
Tula the founder of NetBeans still

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,439
working on NetBeans and that's me and

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,899
this is someone else from Oracle and

00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:16,779
then the next few are not Oracle this is

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:20,740
Antonio Fiero in in Madrid this is

00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:22,990
Salina in in Thailand so it's a it's a

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:29,459
mixture of different people it's it's

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:32,139
probably about 50% Oracle 50% not Oracle

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:35,170
there are a number of projects based on

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:37,029
top of NetBeans and you find out about a

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,399
praxis life later today so this is a

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,170
multimedia hybrid visual life

00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,980
programming project you found out about

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:48,670
this later today and and another example

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,889
is micro members organizations early as

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,800
April platform so this is an open

00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,769
platform for a traffic control in Bremen

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,230
so this these very large systems created

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,209
on NetBeans that are also impacted by

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,399
this and we've contacted all these

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,350
different organizations at French and to

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,699
say hey we're making a move to Apache or

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,470
do you think you know do you want to be

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,149
involved so we really want those

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,529
different organizations to be involved

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,059
and the good thing is these are

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,370
organizations are now all about making

00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,740
this ap is because they've been creating

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,100
applications on top of them that means

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,139
infrastructure

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,870
and to do that there now all these API

00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,670
classes top component node and I know

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,470
about as in some cases about the editor

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,779
functionality so these are the kinds of

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,269
organizations we would like to be more

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,370
involved in the direction and

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,339
development of NetBeans and a number of

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,000
these organizations also NATO Boeing

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:42,089
Airbus this very large systems created

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,680
on top of the NetBeans infrastructure

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,149
they have generic functionality in their

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,279
systems that they could contribute to

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,160
NetBeans and and we could have that

00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,319
within our github repository rather than

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,180
in all these different products so that

00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:58,149
the products that all these downstream

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,800
products can be much more focused on the

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,050
unique features rather than generic

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,139
features which would be in our shared

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:09,449
repository so yes I mentioned the

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:15,490
roadmap so we released a patch net with

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:20,110
9in in July August last year and we

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:24,160
released passionate leads 10 in December

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,810
we have coming up the next release in in

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,850
March which will support your like a

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,329
child but also once include for the

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,649
first time our enterprise modules and

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:36,370
the next release after that will include

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:37,839
the C++ modules in in September that's

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,760
what we are aiming for an in-between we

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,449
might have some other smaller releases

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,360
one small thing before I switch over to

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,670
to Young's demonstration of some new

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,389
features but this is what NetBeans look

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,459
like in the last release by Oracle and a

00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:56,500
discussion I mean it seems too trivial

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,120
but a discussion that we've had for a

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,579
long time is look at this new project

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,980
dialog somebody creates the first java

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,750
application imagine you creating a first

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,279
java application so netbeans is often

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,230
used at schools in universities and so

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,480
on people learning Java for the first

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,000
time they create a new java application

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,209
without knowing it they have creates an

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,899
ant based application a lot of people

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:22,120
have said hey in the real world maven is

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,920
much more widely used than ant wouldn't

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,959
it make sense that the first application

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,120
someone creates is not ant based but

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,699
maven based or maven is all the way down

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,089
here and this is called Java this is

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:34,809
called

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:36,850
it doesn't really make sense so what

00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,430
we've done for the upcoming release so

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,680
this took months of discussion and this

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,899
is this this is the wonderful thing

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,290
about the pachi everything happens on

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,089
mailing lists everything happens if it

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,740
isn't documented on the mailing list it

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,149
never happened you can't have a phone

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,249
call and say hey let's do it like this

00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,110
you have to do everything via

00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:58,389
meaningless so this took months of

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,569
discussion I can tell you and what we

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:05,019
now have is Java with maven driver with

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:06,670
Gradle Java with ant and so we've solved

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:11,139
a couple of things here and created a

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:14,079
new problem but we've solved something

00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:17,589
so one thing we've solved is we have put

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,639
maven first so the very first thing you

00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,749
see as the newbie is maven at the top so

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,279
everyone's happy except for the Gradle

00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:28,839
people find the the what we haven't

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,879
solved is if you're a complete newbie

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,220
you've never touched java before you

00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,899
open this thing and you don't now what

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,939
is maven what is greater what is empty

00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,490
this is this was the nice thing about

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:41,199
the the old structure that you didn't

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,589
know what those things are so you would

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,449
just create your project so this is

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,509
still was a small problem here and one

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:52,179
suggestion is that there might be a

00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,160
catch agree that justice Java and that

00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,749
would link to the maven project and at

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,149
the end of that wizard you would have a

00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:08,579
maven based project there are no easy

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:08,579
answers I'm sorry

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,900
now one read the description field I

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:20,900
don't think people read the description

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:22,490
field so yeah yeah so maybe we could say

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,530
something here about this this is a

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,500
logical first project for you to curate

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,790
or something or a big big capital

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:36,410
letters you have never touched Java

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:38,630
before you know start here blinking so

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:43,670
these are the wonderful discussions you

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,650
can be part of okay so we're going to

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,440
switch to a tiller to a quick demo but

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,660
how you can be involved and meaningless

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,140
I mean NetBeans is like any other Apache

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,760
project

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,770
it's like Apache maven Apache really

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,220
it's all standard we don't have to learn

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,860
anything new as as being new members of

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,080
Apache we just pick up whatever briefie

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,420
has done maven has done and we just I'm

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,380
using that within our within our own

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,390
project one interesting thing to see is

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,790
this page so this shows statistics from

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,270
from Apache about it compares the

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:22,910
different projects to each other and

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:25,010
what you see here is a little circle

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,500
here showing the different sizes of

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,120
projects so this is everything else but

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,240
these are the largest project so you can

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,390
see NetBeans right now 7.9 let's say 8

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,690
million lines of code next is is it's

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,950
OpenOffice if see flags so it's really

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,740
the largest project and we have about 3

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,260
million lines of code coming you know we

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,210
are still in the auditing process of

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,470
some products of NetBeans we decided at

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,230
some point we won't wait for everything

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,510
to be audited we're going to do it in

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,100
batches for the first the nation was

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,140
focused on the platform and with Java

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,420
tools the second donation was focused on

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,920
the enterprise tools and the third

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,690
donation was tutorials and we're working

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,090
on the fourth donation which is the C++

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,310
and after that there's this at least one

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,200
or two more after that and and and the

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,540
other funny thing is it don't take so

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,640
long that at the point where we are

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,830
ready to do a donation the person in

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,200
Oracle who signed the previous donation

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,540
and he understands the process has left

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,330
or has been fired or something and we

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,070
have to find a whole new person just

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,019
the document that explain to them that

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,700
years ago Oracle decided to give

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,740
NetBeans to Apache and it has to be the

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,390
stock Eunice to be signed and so every

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,890
time we have to re-educate a whole layer

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,470
of people in the Oracle management

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,940
structure to actually get the document

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,750
signed to handover that document to

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,309
Apache so it's all interesting

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:46,029
interesting dynamics of you know we've

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:47,649
learnt a lot about how you all the

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,710
pitfalls of being a large enterprise

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,299
that want to transition a project to

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,669
your foundation market patchy or Eclipse

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:58,269
and so on so you can contribute in

00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:00,279
multiple ways a simple way is there's

00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,049
all these tutorials that you can review

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,330
and you can provide pull requests on

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,799
anything that is incorrect that simple

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,299
way just look at the tutorials will

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,700
really need feedback we need to be told

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,630
what's what's wrong with them or told

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,820
that they're right issues found issues

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,440
join the mailing list get involved in

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,480
the discussion this is simply another

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,090
Apache project it's the one and only

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,950
project in Apache that's a buoy tool or

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,600
other things or libraries and you know

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,059
this is another challenge here and we

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,860
have all these icons and logos and if

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,760
Oracle can donate into Apache doesn't

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,409
necessarily mean attached you can

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,539
release them because our they're

00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:37,210
licensed correctly and so we have all

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,760
this if you're a licensing expert if you

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,470
have some legal twisting your brain

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,139
where you enjoy looking at licenses

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,980
please join us because we need people

00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:50,980
like you I hope to work on this so let's

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,039
look at some upcoming features to wrap

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,010
up this session so these are new and

00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:59,399
upcoming Java little features in Apache

00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,399
NetBeans

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,950
you say flower questions this is a good

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,950
time

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,669
you can you can install the C++ modules

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,809
from there from the Oracle released from

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:28,669
the 8.2 plug-in photo and so but there's

00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,539
really nice thing as well as many people

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:34,789
thought well you users NetBeans for C++

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:38,029
but we have seen so many people

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:40,279
complaining where is the C++ support now

00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:42,260
that we don't actually have it in in in

00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,880
the in the distribution right now so

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,860
it's been a wonderful way the fact that

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,059
we haven't included it yet means that

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,350
we're getting all these complaints so we

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,140
can do all these people saying hey we're

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,090
using this but it's coming in September

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,779
release inside NetBeans but you can use

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:59,570
C++ right now today we registered in

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:02,480
Apache NetBeans 10 and also in the next

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,700
release is the URL to the update Center

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,779
for 8.2 it's already registered there so

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,720
you can go to the plug-in manager look

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:18,610
for C++ and install those tools in that

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:18,610
ID okay demo time thank you

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:31,440
okay so hi I'm young and like I am an

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,990
individual contributor to Apache

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:40,770
netbeans my day job is is the open JDK

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:43,590
so what I care a lot about is Java and

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,620
new Java features especially language

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:51,390
features because I am doing the Java

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:53,390
compiler in JDK and so I talked a little

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:58,800
bit about about things that that

00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:00,990
NetBeans can do for for everybody who

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,380
wants to try new showing which features

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:09,510
or who develops open JDK which probably

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:15,150
no one does yet but that's okay so for a

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:18,030
bearing time Nadine's was using the Java

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,010
Sea or the API is from Java C to model

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,560
the Java source code to parse it and

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:26,730
provides a model on which the features

00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,190
can work but until recently

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,940
NetBeans at a special fork of Java Sea

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:37,620
which was streaked so that the ID can

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:40,650
work less a better but then let me first

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,460
moved to Apache there was a change in

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:48,630
that and NetBeans can use the Java

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:51,630
status in the JDK it still has some

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,560
rough edges some things don't work or

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,360
don't work as well as a majority so for

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,760
general users and josie's is still

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,690
better but if you want to take new

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,500


00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:07,890
it's it's fine to to tie or work list

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:12,330
with the chassis from GD k and the point

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:15,260
of death is there is the source code and

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:18,450
you see this instance of stink-ass and

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:21,570
you might have noticed on on blankets

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:27,180
talk yesterday that this is pattern

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:30,060
matching and and it means that if the

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:33,330
variable all is of type thing there will

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,049
be a new variable gated as of type thing

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,809
and

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:40,440
the over be casted into into the new

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,149
variable and this version of Nadine's is

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,570
standing on JDK that understands the

00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:47,610
this this new new staff in in Java which

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,250
is a prototype of course because it's

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:54,000
it's not not approved and so on and it's

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,700
not in the standard reggae and NetBeans

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,669
itself doesn't know basically anything

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:05,820
about about this new feature but since

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:09,690
it's running on a JDK that understands

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:13,289
this new feature it shows no no errors

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,289
because the GRC can understand this you

00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:34,440
can get the code completion on this

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:36,890
price and so on so the ID itself doesn't

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:42,000
understand this this concept but Java C

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:44,490
does so a lot of things are working but

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,450
of course not everything so for example

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:50,820
you may be able to see that the asset is

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,740
highlighted here but the declaration in

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,000
the instance of it is not because ID

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:59,720
itself doesn't understand the

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:05,220
constructor that may be coming and

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:09,480
related think a different variety Apache

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,840
Nadine's saying stan has support to

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,070
directly work this the open JDK source

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:21,529
code mostly so basically what you can do

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:29,880
is you can you can open the modules from

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:31,950
openjdk in java base here and i have to

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,270
admit i already had this discussion open

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,520
it takes a little bit while before the

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:42,680
ID understands the project and so on

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:46,890
and you can you can

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:56,070
let me try to make this bigger you can

00:26:46,890 --> 00:27:00,630
browse the the subscribe so this is this

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:03,600
is joy tell records but there but okay

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:06,000
so this this is for me this is

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,780
reasonably cool because I can work on

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,480
only sources without anything else but

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:16,860
what's even more cool at least for me is

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,140
that open JDK is using a special

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:25,380
framework for tests that is called GT

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:28,440
reg it's finally special because it's

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:32,160
very old because open JDK started this

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,390
testing before are so not open jika jika

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:40,950
started this testing before these new

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:45,480
frameworks so-called so normally or I

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:49,200
don't know when I joy JDK it wasn't very

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,660
easy for me to the back test it was very

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,220
very compact so if I had a failing test

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,050
I had to do a lot of stuff to actually

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:04,800
know what was happening in the test was

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:07,200
happening in the JDK but in NetBeans so

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:11,600
this is this is a test that is testing

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:15,510
the Geritol records button and it has

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,600
like this the other is a description of

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,850
the test for for G th and what what

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,500
NetBeans can do now is that you you just

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,500
say debug test

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:44,100
it all started and you can be back yes

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:44,100
normally it should over you can yeah I

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,510
can let the tester for a little and it

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,430
will stop at that sometimes they can

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:55,360
actually jump to the three source code

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:59,380
and this is all this this all of us in

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,740
Virginia instance so it should yeah so

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,770
we can look into into the actual

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:12,730
implementation in JDK debug that see

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:14,620
what it's doing and yeah like for me

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,350
this is this is very cool because I can

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:21,640
actually debug I actually then I develop

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:25,210
I entirely manual Italian in test cases

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,760
I simply Kato test and debug the test

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,470
it's much easier than like started

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,120
torture somewhere and attached to it is

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:42,490
the back it's easier to Kato desk and

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:45,460
yeah so how much time do here ok yeah so

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:49,530
this was this was about Java and well

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:54,670
another new thing in Apache NetBeans and

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:58,330
this partly was in in 10 but the it's

00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:00,820
better in in the upcoming Tilly's is

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,490
some elementary support for the english'

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:10,960
protocol or a client for the protocol

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:15,880
and so as a Remo to not be controller

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:22,660
here too much there is several for the

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:29,230
LSP that supports the escape so this

00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:32,170
idea is using that that using that

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:35,680
server to to provide the like a little

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:38,110
features for the - escape so she escapes

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,300
so you can see there is the the

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,710
navigator

00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:46,110
okay left bottom corner days there is a

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,850
function that is this it's actually

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:55,740
coming straight from the server we can

00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:59,940
say if if we pass like control click run

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:03,540
it will jump at the the function that we

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:10,830
are calling if you break the code we get

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:14,520
some errors from me Sarah let me show ya

00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:19,880
and you notice there is internal I think

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:22,740
that that's actually using a camera from

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,760
Visual Studio code detects main camera

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,040
and so I have to thank our Eclipse

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,820
colleagues because both these things

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:37,590
like the client for the language Sarah

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:40,050
protocol is based on the SPF of J and I

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,940
need to be careful because there is as P

00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,070
for J that is the right way and there is

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,330
SP for e and that is the implementation

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:54,650
so I sometimes make negative gray and

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:58,650
the the syntax highlighting is using

00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:01,140
text money for e I think that's it but

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,360
just just the path not the part that

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,190
changes the text in eclipse just the

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:13,890
part of passes the Decapolis

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:16,650
and alexis the source code and so just

00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:21,510
to demonstrate what what it means to to

00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:25,230
add the support as I've seen to met

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:28,980
beans right now for the language they

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:32,810
require what needs to be done is to have

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,690
a plugin that starts the server and

00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:39,360
register set for some for some Maya

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:42,810
you also need to have vertical data

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,020
objects or hematite but there is dessert

00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:50,010
for that but basically what you need to

00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,990
do for LSP is start the cellar and

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,840
return some kind of description

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,120
there is input output and and it's good

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,550
to send the actual pulses that is that

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,690
again the service selling so that I

00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:05,160
became collectively and for the girls

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,170
it's even easier

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,630
there's better active description if you

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:13,350
place the camera at the correct place

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:16,470
and I did the great attributes as well

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:20,220
the ideal like find the camera and

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:24,030
render the source code or dollar the

00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,240
source code based on on the camera so

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:30,320
okay I think that's that's a that's what

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,320
I wanted to show

00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:54,389
so the question is letter in the

00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:57,119
four-digit h support where the hospitals

00:33:54,389 --> 00:34:00,450
are working and the answer is that I am

00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:09,740
Not sure they I stink not at this time

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:17,490
but I I didn't I no no no not right now

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:21,059
but definitely not be back so but like

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:25,049
for native parts you can now like at

00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:30,029
least open them but but not not okay so

00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:33,419
I may be mistaken there is a see project

00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:34,260
for hot spot and there it's possible to

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,260
do something with that

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,899
I don't know spots away so I don't know

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,000
exactly how that work but there are

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:46,319
opportunities there is no no see support

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,119
yet so you would in any case you the see

00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:50,119
support from the origin of man means

00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,730
open the projects

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,270
that means protecting the JDK but

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:19,720
no no no net no net net net means like

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,820
30 40 like OpenJDK modules they have

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,040
this module in force and that means

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,730
understands the I out can be modeling

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,610
force so you don't need like for opening

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,060
the openjdk modules you don't need any

00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:37,810
other metadata for probably right

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:39,520
modules that are Java it's then it

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:44,460
simply opens what's in the air a

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,460
