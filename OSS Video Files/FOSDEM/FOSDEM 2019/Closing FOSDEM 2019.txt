	00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:15,449
so closing talk we are still the verge

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:19,640
world's largest conference we have 788

00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,640
events we have tons of cars

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,440
we still have tons of artificial Mach

00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,480
numbers Caesars this is the same Texas

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,020
last year for very good reason or almost

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,240
the same of course people are using

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,130
privacy extensions is a good thing we

00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,989
could try and identify you and we would

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,000
probably succeed in in many different

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,230
ways but we do not want to do this for

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,300
obvious reasons but others can so two

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,090
years ago we felt the need to to talk

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,030
about what networks and what networks we

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,040
do not run last year we felt the need to

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,680
talk a little bit of about men in the

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,510
middle this year we felt a need about to

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
talk about ARP spoofing and script

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,310
kiddies being stupid

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,550
generally speaking whatever happens here

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,110
please be nice and also state actors are

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,030
a lot worse than whatever people here

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,100
can do so what can you do

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,440
please use inscription please use VPNs

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,210
using cryptid services encrypt

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
everything also by the way you can kind

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,260
of use encryption and if you find any of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,579
those people who do bad things just an

00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,040
invite a knock so things are improving

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,140
you will be granted us access to the

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,689
welc which is the Wi-Fi controller for

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,060
this whole site so next year hopefully

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,579
we will be able to have a lot better and

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,770
point security on the Wi-Fi then we had

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,719
the last year's will have to look at

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,189
this like software versions how to

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,610
versions blah blah blah but hopefully

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,469
doesn't work and just a fun fact our

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,020
monitoring it is actually the number one

00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,789
user agent on this network because the

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,770
monitoring has become so aggressive and

00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:04,469
so ubiquitous really good news you might

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,259
remember we are the first non networking

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,800
networking specific conference which had

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,820
a I P v6 only default network the very

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,820
first in the world

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,380
this was in 2015 and it got tons of

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,530
people to fix their code and their

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,080
services so this is the first year we

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,870
had more people on the v6 only network

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,080
than on a dual stack network which is

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,240
really really really nice

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,490
second thing most of the people on the

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,910
visa v4 or on the dual stack network

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,440
very using VPN services and VPNs kind of

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,420
don't like when you lie to them which

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,030
net6 four does so this is a good thing

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,130
and this means that tons of people are

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,050
actually using VPN services even if they

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,340
can still kind of stuck to v4 for this

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,680
reason but that's a good reason to be

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,990
stuck to v4 so we sold lots of stuff I

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,700
don't know why we had to 301 of the

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:09,460
fitted shirts and 1k of the others that

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,710
didn't really make sense but we have odd

00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,960
numbers and we actually ran out on the

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,430
first day at noon of the L sized hoodies

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,580
so we kind of need to bring more of

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,580
those next time you guys are hungry and

00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:30,250
I wasn't aware we had brownies then

00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,570
thank you to our sponsors first and

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,759
foremost you'll be

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,759
[Applause]

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:48,120
when the corner store corner store

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,120
sponsors which are Google

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,840
and Red Hat

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,840
[Applause]

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,039
and all the other sponsors

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,039
[Applause]

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,820
we could have more sponsors but we do

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,640
not take on more sponsors deliberately

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,010
we cut off sponsorship relatively

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,600
quickly because you also donate to us

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,280
and it's really important for us to be

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,410
like not on one single foot then there's

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,270
tons of volunteers and if anyone is here

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,490
just come up

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,490
[Applause]

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:59,550
[Applause]

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,470
[Applause]

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:17,000
we have a total of 170 so these are not

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,250
all of them but then we have a few staff

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,610
members those who are also ready to come

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:32,680
up

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:32,680
[Applause]

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,039
the stuff you're not seeing here are

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,460
doing video or cleaning up or a sick at

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,210
home so they're really busy and also

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,210
thank you

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,360
[Applause]

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,159

00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:00,919
we've made it even easier to give us

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:03,319

talk you visited it's really easy to

just get quick feedback and this is

00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,659
really important to us cause we want to

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:46,610
not good also the review system if

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,949

something we don't know yet what but

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,870
will collate it into something so we can

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,290
do things like show pictures from 2001

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:48,640
or random vampires which don't age over

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:51,760
20 years okay so you don't recognize him

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,670
he could convince myself that kind of

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,260
died okay whatever anyway we would like

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,240
to do more of this and we have obviously

00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,590
quite a few of pictures and stuff but

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,500
still we would like to have more so

memories at FOSDEM org please send us

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,950
