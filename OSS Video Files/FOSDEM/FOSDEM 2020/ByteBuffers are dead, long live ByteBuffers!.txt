Abstract: Direct buffers are, to date, the only way to access foreign,
off-heap memory. Despite their success, direct buffers suffer from some
limitations --- stateful-ness, lack of addressing space,
non-deterministic deallocation to name a few --- which makes them a
less-than-ideal choice under certain workloads. In this talk we paint
the path to the future: a safe, supported and efficient foreign memory
access API for Java. By providing a more targeted solution to the
problem of accessing foreign memory, not only developers will be freed
by the above limitations - but they will also enjoy improved
performances, as the new API is designed from the ground-up with JIT
optimizations in mind - and all without sacrificing memory access safety.
