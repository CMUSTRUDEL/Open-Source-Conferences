Would you like a DNS server for IPv6 where adding a new node is as simple as typing in its name?
If the answer is yes, try HashDNS.
IPv6 autoconfiguration methods can give addresses to interfaces but do not provide any means of configuring the DNS. So autoconfiguration is suitable for clients. If a host has to act as a server, it must have a fully qualified domain name and the DNS service has to map its name to its IP address.


In the Internet of Thread scenario, the number of network nodes can be orders of magnitude higher than before, as each process or thread can be a node. This idea of hash based IPv6 addresses is a viable solution to the problem to manage the DNS resolution in IoTh environments.


The host part of an IPv6 address can be computed as the result of a hash function computer on the fully qualified domain name.


In this way it is possible to write a DNS server able to resolve the addresses of any hostname in a sub-domain provided the network prefix of that sub-domain.


The installation of a new node of the network (computer, namespace, IoTh process) is as simple as providing it with its IPv6 address (the one obtained by concatenating the network prefix and the host address computed by the hash function).


There is no need to change the configuration of the DNS.


Actually the installation of a new node (or its renaming) is even simpler than that. The host can use a DHCP service designed to get the right address from the DNS server given its fully qualified domain name.


So a system administrator has nothing to do more than assigning the new node its name. (They have just to baptize the new node)

that I cannot there is virtual square is

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,900
a team of developers studying the

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,900
frontiers of your quality I indeed the

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,859
group / the group was created in Bologna

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:32,669
I don't know 16 17 years ago we have

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:35,040
done several several projects our most

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,770
famous processes mediator distributed

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
the internet which is virtually eaten is

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,240
supported by many virtual machines like

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,860
avian came over / boxer or a user not

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,450
Linux today I am talking about

00:00:48,860 --> 00:01:01,050
Hokkien as a fully qualified domain name

00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:04,229
the ACP we are dealing with Internet of

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,930
threads so our idea is that it's

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,390
anachronistic to give IP addresses just

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,329
to interfaces or machine

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:19,909
maybe it's process in the future can

00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:25,560
have its own IP address we need strikes

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:29,850
networking structure as libraries and we

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,359
need the ipv6 because given that we want

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,460
address it's a process so we need a

00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:42,990
great number of IP addresses available

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:46,579
which is the problem with ipv6 from one

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,990
sided that you have to write down

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:56,429
128-bit each time you want to write in a

00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:01,649
an address it means I think 32 X or

00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:06,689
decimal digits so it's a procedure very

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:11,569
prone to error yeah and the second is

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:16,319
that you have to deal with DNS

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:18,170
addressing this kind of nonsense so they

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:26,390
I think

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:30,950
the dream that a maintainer is that man

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:36,440
working with DNS a dream that this kind

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:41,270
of person has is to be able to to add

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,730
and you know just by writing those two

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,489
lines over there so I created this

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,580
seminar in a circular way first of all I

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,280
wanna show you which is the goal of the

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,430
topic of this seminar and then we are

00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,319
going to see how to achieve that goal so

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,819
I want to add to the interface that

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:12,260
their interface file in it it is the

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:14,989
network just those two lines efface here

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,760
the the top tier is just an example the

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:23,239
interfaces you wanna give an address and

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,859
got the name and everything must be

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,130
configured in an automatical way we want

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:35,180
is to configure the actual ipv6 address

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,530
of the machine the dns for the for the

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:44,930
direct and the DNS for the reverse

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:49,040
resolution how can it be done why

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:52,030
because ipv6 adoption ensures that not

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,420
only for our Internet of triodes

00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:00,530
processes or virtual machines but even

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:06,489
for real machines in late November last

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:12,910
late November ripe in year who emitted a

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:23,770
warning saying that they ran out of ipv4

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:32,210
Nats the first idea is to use the ACP so

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:38,190
for in ipv6 terminology stateful Auto

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:41,370
configuration there is an NFS c-47a -

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,190
that says that the queries can include a

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,260
fully qualified domain name but this

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,260
fully qualified domain name is usually

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:59,100
in order to update the DNS once the ipv6

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:04,700
has been calculated by the DHCP server

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:08,930
so the DHCP is responsible for

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:12,030
generating the ipv6 address and then

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,830
that fully qualified domain name is used

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:23,100
to push the pair name addressed to the

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:29,520
DNS we have extended the idea of this of

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:33,690
this field of this option when the DHCP

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,120
server gets a query including a fully

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:41,460
qualified domain name it asks the DNS

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,770
which is the IP address for that name

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:49,230
and the answer from the DNS is used to

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:56,280
create the actual ipv6 address to the

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:59,970
node okay so you can just give the name

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,470
and provided the DNS is able to give an

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:08,370
address to that name the game is

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:15,740
completely closed so we have achieved

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:19,980
this result but there is another point

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,310
there is the standard way that this how

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:31,080
fully qualified Romanian DHCP works the

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:35,610
client ask make it makes a query but

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,700
instead of the DHCP returning address it

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:43,460
asks for the DNS server for the name

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,590
resolution the second row is the same

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,230
set of act

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,860
but in order not to put too many errors

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,760
that they are repeated so the the answer

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,590
path is from the DNS server the IP

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,590
address that is forwarded to the client

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:06,320
but this is not enough because in this

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,600
way you can give the name of the holster

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,410
you can use the two lines but you have

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,889
to configure your DNS server in order to

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:22,960
write your address so we need a second

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:29,150
idea hash based ipv6 addresses so

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:34,850
instead of having long and boring tables

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:38,660
in the DNS server we generate the low 64

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:46,760
bits of the ipv6 address as a hash of

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:55,550
the name so given the prefix of that

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:59,750
network you can just catenate the prefix

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:06,080
and a tail which is computed as in hash

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:08,360
out of the name and you have a serve in

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,860
an empty v6 address it means that this

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:18,740
kind of DNS server if it has been

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:25,250
created for roam my Corp or kia is able

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:35,060
to resolve any name and in Rome my Corp

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:39,740
of the torque may be okay maybe the the

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:43,600
IP that the DNS server generates an IP

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:47,150
address which belongs to no one

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,930
so you have a DNS server which is able

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:57,130
to translate anything that answer in a

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,130
dot on my Corp order so

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:07,490
Danya is that now we have to say to the

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,900
DNS server the prefix we have reduced

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,520
the complexity of the problem but still

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:21,110
we have to provide the the DNS server

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,830
this DNS server with the prefix actually

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:28,310
the DNS that the preface can be computed

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:32,840
by it in a DNS server itself so let us

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,170
see step by step how the process the

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,180
resolution process has been carried out

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,750
a-crying somewhere in the world wanna

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,800
talk with w cuba hash my name archaea

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:50,440
and it it asks to the closest to the NS

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,290
a-- the resolution so there is the the

00:09:50,440 --> 00:10:01,370
the recursion of a name server at the

00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:04,460
end the query the query reaches the DNS

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,160
server of my domain to torture my there

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:12,230
is an error obviously it was my name the

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,630
target my name the torture the the the

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,170
main server which is assigned or bind

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:25,730
server for world today because there is

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:30,980
a delegation for was the the query to

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:35,240
the hash dns server who asks to this DNS

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,490
server which is the base address in

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,690
order to have no configuration at all in

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:49,300
the hash DNS server which can handle

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:49,300
many sub sub domain of my name but order

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,940
now the DNS server that the NSA with the

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,460
maintainer server replies with base

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,040
address actually a nice computer at the

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,230
complete address that is returned to the

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,220
client okay so in this way I have just

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,100
to put

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,420
line saying which is the base address in

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,570
the standard DNS server and everything

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:25,520
can be done without further

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:31,690
configuration but baptize your you know

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:35,450
the giver give it a name so now we can

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,060
use the two technology togethers

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:45,520
together we can have the note asking the

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:51,080
DNS or asking the DHCP server is its

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:57,380
address the DCP server asks the hash DNS

00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:01,610
address a and in this way everything

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,840
converges and exhaust by the name giving

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:08,930
the name you can have the the trickles

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,270
the ipv6 address DNS or forward a

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:17,350
solution what about DNS reversal

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:25,760
resolution as Genessa takes a cache of

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:27,950
the recently sort resolved names and you

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,680
can there is a configuration you can now

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:36,740
you can force this cache to to to store

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,040
all the resolution but in such case you

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,020
can have out of memory attacks somebody

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,100
who can't want to resolve many many

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,810
names that can fill in your cache or you

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:54,380
can buy an option set the DNS server to

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:59,900
store just the request coming from the

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:05,090
same net so the local requests you can

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,490
say if you give ipv6 address 64 of the

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:12,829
people six addressed by hash you can

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:16,639
have collisions yes that's true

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:19,759
in theory because if you use some

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:24,110
statistics that there is a application

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:27,379
case of the birthday paradox so

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:30,739
computing the number of possible hasha

00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:36,829
if you are dealing with the network of

00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:40,160
10 1000 not so the probability of hash

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:46,040
collision is less than 10 to the minus

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:49,420
14th 14 so it's a quite low in case it

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,269
happens you can just change the name

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:57,379
instead of double cube web or something

00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:03,019
like that and the probability it drops

00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:05,869
even more if you have more collisions it

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:11,269
means that you have better luck and so

00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:13,600
you'll need to take some some

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:20,329
countermeasures about luck

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:24,439
okay then scenario given that the talk

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:28,699
is not so expensive I decided to give

00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:31,059
you a virtual demo so there is the

00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:36,499
scenario and there are slides in which

00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:40,819
you can see the the sequence of comments

00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:46,480
and yeah the sequence of Commons and the

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:50,209
expected output the scenario has been

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:56,449
carried on carried out on wanna VD

00:14:50,209 --> 00:15:01,459
Network but as the picture may may make

00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:05,179
evident it should be on a real network -

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:08,389
so the everything applies to real or

00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:13,309
virtual networks in the local area

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:19,939
network we have they have DNS we have

00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:23,740
the fully qualified DHCP server and I'm

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:28,850
a client on the same net

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:32,200
okay and somewhere I have a DNS server

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:37,240
primary for this is one of our domains

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:41,540
weighted that sheís thought University

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,880
ok let us follow the require the the

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:48,320
slides can you see there at the cursor

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:53,660
it's a bit black but here in this part

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:58,730
of the slider I've copied some lines so

00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:03,140
from the bind nine delegation so the

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:07,970
whatever is hash the v-square CSU

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:13,940
nobility IT is dedicated to that to that

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:20,380
the NSA renamed the hash DNS which has

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:25,150
an ipv4 and ipv6 address the next line

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:29,690
hash we squares yes universidad mapper

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:32,300
without a final dot so it means that it

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,240
was also Ashby three squares yes

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:40,390
University map square CSU nobility is

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:46,190
the base address for that sub Network

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:51,920
and for example I use a cinema to show

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:55,700
that you can one questions that may

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,790
arise is that the names are related to

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:07,339
the to the local area network so if you

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:11,620
wanna give sibling names in network you

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:16,400
can you will you need to have different

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:22,010
base address but you can you see names

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,520
so ever the name related to the physical

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,640
position of the host the name is related

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,010
to the physical position of the host we

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,760
changed the one generator from the hash

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:37,210
table and the name the short name as a

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,149
cname to the act

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,169
generated name okay that's only the

00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:48,220
delegation then I have connected my

00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:51,190
switch to to switch connected to the

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,409
Internet in the real world this means

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,010
I've connected one plug to the streets

00:17:53,409 --> 00:18:00,370
and the other plug to the router I've

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,470
started on one host here on the web tour

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,940
Network but you can do it in an area

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,010
network I've started they have DNS and

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:13,320
which are the argument of oxygen acid

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:17,260
sailors now there is a proof of concept

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,210
there is a proof of concept working from

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,529
Wisconsin we are going where we are in

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:28,450
this time rewriting the code ways in in

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:31,419
a more completed accommodated way but as

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:39,460
DNS to the common connected over to

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:44,140
networker this is the name the the

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:49,809
suffix to have the base address so this

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,380
hash DNS query for cache which were blah

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:56,080
blah

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,539
it it searches in the DNS cache which

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,159
query as the university maps which

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:07,059
Square CSU nobility so you have the ipv4

00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,830
address so with the default gateway ipv6

00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,590
address with the default gateway and

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,770
that's enough for the happiness are no

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:22,809
more configuration for qualified

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:27,490
immunity SCP is even simpler because you

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:29,710
can just start the the server saying

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:35,440
which is the interface of the virtual

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:39,549
network it has to run in so let us try

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,500
some experiments of virtual experiments

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:46,840
so one experiment is use this

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,840
infrastructure to give addresses to

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,310
namespaces because we now has been in

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,200
space

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:59,670
if you try if you just type with ENSO

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:04,080
video dot slash slash believed that

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,640
social action is as kind of URL in which

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,520
you can use a different kind of

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,990
technologies which is legacy technology

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:19,190
VD but you can have weeks VD or many

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,190
others really if you want now

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:35,970
unfortunately the AC client does not

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,680
have a option in common line to say send

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,580
a fully qualified domain name so the

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,960
only way is to create a temporary

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,040
configuration file to say just that

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,380
option so I created this temporary

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,500
configuration file with this with this

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:57,000
command is just a single line of a

00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:03,600
configuration and then I asked about the

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,540
DAC client to give an address and just

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,840
using this the whole infrastructure came

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:15,020
to this namespace and ipv6 address so

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:21,570
and forward the reverse configuration

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:23,790
mmm if you have a KVA machine that's the

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:31,770
common to start with KVM machine

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:36,780
connected to VD you can just add in the

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:48,630
ATA in the interface dot t-- file the

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:51,330
two lines of the first slide and now I'm

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,160
sorry for these two lines it is

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,100
explained it in the next slide because

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,910
I've taken as you can see phoenixes oh

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,210
sorry

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,210
a

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:12,270
city-based well-known image so to show

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:15,890
you that is nothing as in the system but

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,310
that configuration and the files

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,770
generated by the script these are

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,390
general these two files are the

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:29,670
scripture to use the fully qualified

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:32,150
domain in the ACP in a 15 which is which

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,500
are general not related to the specific

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:41,730
addresses this specific node so given

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,700
you add these two files to to give the

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,520
fabric down and the rules to apply in

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:57,120
order to get to take an interface up and

00:22:47,520 --> 00:23:01,110
down and I fulfilled my promise and the

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,670
premises and in this way I have given

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:13,800
the IP address forward the reversal

00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:17,550
resolution in into lines 10.0 I told you

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,720
for the reversal resolution that there

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:26,700
is a cache of the recently resolved

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:32,010
names to have the reversal solution one

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:37,350
may say but after a while this kind of

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:42,510
casual can expire but given the ACP that

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:46,350
from time to time is renewing the the

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:49,290
address the ACP is also reviewing the

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:56,220
reverse resolution so everything seems

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:59,730
to be in army so if you have question or

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,310
for further info you can have a look of

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,960
our wiki site where there is the

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,600
Leicester the long list of all

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,760
approaches or obviously you can contact

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,760
me by email thank you

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:24,690
Thank You Renzo any questions for Renzo

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:26,490
Andre hi this is Andre from I see so so

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,790
my question is and I might have missed

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,680
it

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,720
who is a target audience for this

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,330
because it breaks quite a lot of

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,800
assumptions about the ipv6 like privacy

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,870
or who configures the IP address so so

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,810
who is the who's the user and user so

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:50,700
who would use your technology that so

00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:54,090
that's my best maintenance of DNS or

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:57,260
design of DNA so the wanna add this

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:02,480
feature or maintainer of the Anessa were

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:06,360
too busy to add useless ipv6 addresses

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:11,310
so these features could be integrated in

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:16,560
future dns servers or the community of

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:21,720
dns development can help us to provide a

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:26,000
final solution a final implementation of

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,000
these ideas in the most effective way

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,200
Dimitri I don't give you Mike

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,249
for many highly available servers it is

00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,249
common to assign multiple IP addresses

00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:46,399
to multiple hosts which served the same

00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:47,989
fully qualified domain name such that by

00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,559
definition you will have the hash

00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:54,889
collision how do you resolve that when

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:57,169
you want to serve archive dub intercom

00:25:54,889 --> 00:26:03,070
from many servers which all should have

00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:06,230
ipv6 addresses that's quite still and

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:10,720
don't you give those machines also IP

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,720
Spurs serves they run at a given time

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:16,070
normally you do but if you want to use

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,649
this then all of them will get assigned

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,359
the same hash and the same IP right I

00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:28,210
think we have two different kind of

00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:32,389
users if you have a year to observer

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:35,649
supplying managing hundreds millions of

00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:39,049
queries per second you need that kind of

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:41,359
solutions and you have not so many of

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:45,440
them so even writing the address is not

00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,989
a problem but if you have every switch

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,330
in your room having an IP address and

00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:54,649
you want to query that so you want the

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:57,889
address of that in such a case writing

00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:02,570
down the twenty 128-bit for ease of time

00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:04,759
is quite a daunting procedure think

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,539
about the first idea said that we want

00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:11,739
to give the address of Perl to processes

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:18,999
so in such a case one address is enough

00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:18,999
okay one more quick question for Enzo

00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:25,419
let's do start here

00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,419
big big quick

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,750
it's encryption something which is also

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,669
of interest for DNS of people

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,350
I mean hashing is one thing but do

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,539
people want to encrypt their DNS as well

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,710
because once you've once you've once

00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,150
you've hashed its then I was thinking

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,480
the next step would be to make it so

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,130
other people can't snoop is is that not

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,799
how it works or is that not a nice

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:51,570
option I don't think that's endoscope

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,520
but well what we're having a couple of

00:27:51,570 --> 00:28:00,600
talks about that later

00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:02,960
stick around so Erin last question what

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,480
about I just Express the extensions

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,490
accurate this substitutes the privacy

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,450
attention because one problem out the

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,450
ipv6 out

00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,669
stateless also configuration is that you

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,220
give your MAC address this is just

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:24,020
relations with the name so you don't

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,159
have an improvement with your IP

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,669
self-generative use excel dress nobody

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,669
can see it

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,900
okay thank you Renzo thanks here thank

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,109
