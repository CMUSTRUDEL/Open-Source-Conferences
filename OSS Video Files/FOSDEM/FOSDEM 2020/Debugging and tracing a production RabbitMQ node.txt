In this talk, we will see how to debug/trace on a running RabbitMQ node.
Erlang remote access and remote debugging are builtin features in Erlang/Elixir.❮br/❯
With these features, it is possible to see what's happening inside a BEAM node (as RabbitMQ).
I will show also how to use "dynamic loading"  to add a not native code in a running beam.

There are a set of tools inside the beam like etop, eprof, dbg, fprof ... that work in the same Linux way.
In this talk, we will see how to use some of these features on a running RabbitMQ node.
