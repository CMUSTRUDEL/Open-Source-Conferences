Compilation and execution are as different as night and day. Or are they? By blurring the lines, Elixir (and the BEAM VM) enable some very powerful and useful meta-programming techniques.


In this presentation, Marten will talk about running and generating code at compile-time, Elixir's hygienic macros, and how to compile and hot-reload altered or extra code, while your program is running!
Besides explaining these concepts, their usefulness will be motivated using various practical real-world examples.
