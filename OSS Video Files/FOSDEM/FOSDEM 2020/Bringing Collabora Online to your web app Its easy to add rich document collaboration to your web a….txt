The Collabora Online code-base can bring the power of LibreOffice into
an iframe inside your web app. Come and hear how this works, how to integrate
secure, collaborative document editing with your software, and about all the
latest greatest work going on there.
Collabora Online uses a WOPI-like protocol, and it is rather simple to integrate.
Come hear about the total of three REST methods you need for a simple
integration, as well as the wealth of options to control how collaboration works.


Hear about some of our integrations into Nextcloud, Kolab,
Mattermost, Moodle, ownCloud, and many more.


See the internals of Collabora Online, and how you can get involved with
building, debugging, and developing it, and checkout some of the new features
for Mobile and PC browser that we've been working on to make life better
for our users.

	00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,580
bringing calibre online to your weather

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,689
perfect perfect well thank you for

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,910
coming 10 seconds

00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,980
okay well let's count down for three you

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,230
know Melanie thank you for coming

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,520
so say caliber online I who knows what

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,180
it is I mean if you know what it is I

00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,529
don't have to

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,960
okay well fair enough there are a few

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,360
people that don't I'm sorry so

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,960
collaborative editing imagine Google

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,039
Docs or Microsoft Office 365 or they

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,340
probably you'll get a headache if you

00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,870
imagine that for too long so we do a

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,870
document spreadsheet slides viewing

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,640
collaborative editing phones tablets web

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,559
all that stuff um brilliant

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,079
interoperability we are the Microsoft

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,879
file format lovers in the look at us we

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,850
we we have to interoperate with all this

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,949
wonderful legacy stuff RTF the legacy of

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,829
the last standards war you know you may

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,570
think ODF is the standards war but RTF

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,860
it's the previous standards war and it

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,100
still lives on in many governments

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,620
amazingly PDF Visio all sorts of other

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,330
filters in there are possible and it

00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,430
does WYSIWYG rendering that's quite

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,080
important because other people don't

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,360
necessarily like office a word online

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
doesn't do WYSIWYG anymore it's back to

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,190
the word five era of not being able to

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,140
see how your document lays out and I

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,520
guess the key oh the key thing is that I

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,130
should get my display to actually

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,870
project the slides properly so that you

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,900
can actually see them all that that's

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:44,620
probably the the key deliverable at this

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:48,980
stage once 1280 800 okay perfect

00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,540
better I think mmm-hmm yes and so it

00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,610
should integrate on-premise with you or

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,260
your existing EFS SC if you just drop it

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,630
into one of these things it should work

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,100
nicely if you're a learning type person

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,800
Moodle or something like this matter

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,810
most um if it doesn't do it yet then

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,520
well you can come to my talk and I'll

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,960
show you how I'm so the architecture is

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,390
really a bet on CPU threads and network

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,729
getting cheaper we run a chunk of this

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,920
stuff on the server and so to install

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,000
that you then just grab a code image

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,790
you've got packages

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,440
you've got docker images for every

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,910
conceivable Linux distribution of

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,770
source code and yeah so you um yeah you

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,690
plug it in and connect to yourself and

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,700
and fiddle with your web app sometimes

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,810
people people like to just convert

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,540
documents so if you want a thumbnail

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,160
documents or convert documents from you

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,510
know flat IDs to PDF for invoicing oh we

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,350
can do that very easily as well so

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,810
there's a nice REST API there yeah so

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,310
yeah but but the integration is really

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,260
just an iframe you you can you can check

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,720
it out and run it of course like that um

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,990
but but getting data into it so so this

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,550
is this kind of this kind of thing this

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,780
kind of thing okay so it's at the demo

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,660
stuff that we give you basically loads

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,130
files of your file system which is

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,270
mostly what you don't want to do you

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,030
want to be able to serve you through

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,520
this nice API so in terms of

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,530
understanding this um this is a very

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,260
simple piece of software we require only

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,060
Lib C and that's pretty much it of a

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,940
Linux system we have no dependencies

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,370
once you include the you know draw a box

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,930
around the whole bundle so we don't need

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,230
a database we don't really need the file

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,489
system very much at all and but we do

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,680
need to get data so how do we do that

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,209
well we store that in say next cloud or

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,730
own cloud and we do that through a rest

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,160
interface which combines authentication

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,360
and storage so we don't do any

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,580
authentication I know nothing about

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,140
sam'l and I'm very happy about that and

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,090
I know very little about object

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,459
databases I'm extremely happy about that

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,140
and and you know metadata stores and

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,239
clustering my hope is that you've done

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,830
all that already and and you know or you

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,300
have a plan for this kind of thing and

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,340
we don't need to care because you can

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,440
give us a token and we will give it back

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,060
to you to prove that it's still us you

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,380
know and and that's that's basically

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,200
what what P does see there are two

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,970
things - sir there's a Whoopie source

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,850
which effectively defines the file or

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,620
the stream it is and its version and so

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,540
on and then there's a fence occation

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,940
thing we basically do a post into the

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,670
iframe that sends those two things

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,200
separately and then okay so so we want

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,390
to get a file we call a get on your

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,130
storage we do a web get it's that hard

00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,419
okay and we pass these credentials back

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:26,210
and you decide and to save we do a post

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,740
again tricky stuff and then there's a

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,870
there is a slightly tricky method check

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,900
file info here and this allows us to do

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,900
all sorts of cool thing so it gives

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,340
of course at roots we could just fail on

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,020
the get to give the file in terms of

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,700
permissions management you could go yeah

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,650
can't give it to you but wouldn't it be

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,210
nice if you could have read-only various

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,270
different permissions you know can they

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,950
comment can the idiot can they read line

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,750
what's their name where's their avatar

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,450
URL so we can do this little thing and

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,050
all of that kind of metadata tends to

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,490
come back from a check file info so

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,500
there is the security token obviously I

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,700
I guess I mentioned that before we don't

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,810
care to us it's a totally opaque string

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,640
but it shouldn't have anything to do

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,200
with the document so document stuff on

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,880
once our sighting uses stuff on the

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,100
other because everyone that collaborates

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,570
inside the same document has the same

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,490
huapi source and that's very important

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,350
when you come to spreading this over

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,700
clusters and so on everyone needs to end

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,500
up on the same night so yeah oh there's

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,870
a discovery but honestly this doesn't

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,280
matter like whatever you you can look

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,520
stuff up in the discovery and do clever

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,050
things or not but yeah who cares you can

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,640
just do it directly if you like hard

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,170
Kate it you know at least least for a

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,350
prototype so yeah the check file info

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,790
endpoint yep and you can just get a

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,470
hello will very easily you have a simple

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,480
an HTML document that looks well a bit

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,800
like this it's not very big as you can

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,780
see in there's a form action here and

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,960
it's got this you know all these details

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,820
that go across and bingo there you are

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,140
um yeah I think that's pretty much

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,760
pretty much the works now of course once

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,090
you've got it embedded and it's looking

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,710
beautiful as it does you then might want

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,750
to to play around with it unfortunately

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,900
have time to test my wife demo earlier

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,050
so it may well not work so I might skip

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,940
that reasons of time but essentially you

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,480
can post messages inside and outside and

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,290
across the frames to do all sorts of

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,590
exciting things this little demo here

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,240
that you can grab out of the source and

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,650
configure as as instructed and so

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,300
actually we can figure it to do cross

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,300
site scripting checking by default so

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,140
you have to add localhost into the the

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,030
configuration so he can trust itself to

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,420
do what it does in the demo which is

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,530
that slightly an elegant thing and then

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,150
yeah then you can play with it so you

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,240
can you know hide your menu bars if you

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,530
don't want menu bars and you can see

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
around stuff you can even inject

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,240
arbitrary calls to scripts in here so

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,130
you can send a Python script that runs

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,860
in the backend and you can generate a

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,120
form or a report or do your database

00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,380
queries at the site you know there's all

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,440
sorts of things you can do with embedded

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,960
Python there if you want and drive that

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,569
from the UI and so some people we have a

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,220
customer that uses this for doing like I

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,080
want this area of a spreadsheet I want

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,729
to select a spreadsheet and I want to

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,280
dump this somewhere else I want to

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,810
dynamically move data into these things

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,509
not to make them and so that's that's

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,099
all stuff that you can um you can do and

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,729
we have a vast scripting API obviously a

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:25,770
thousand and a thousand interfaces with

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:30,840
God knows how many methods that you can

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,520
use use from that yeah so you can also

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,500
add your own toolbar buttons and things

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,139
people like custom buttons did I mention

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:43,110
you can theme it and skin it and CSS to

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:44,849
the end obviously yeah so yes it's

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,560
obviously worth waiting to the

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:48,780
JavaScript is loaded I think one of the

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,699
the great benefits of JavaScript is not

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,590
knowing what order your JavaScript files

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,969
are loaded in and then what they're

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,889
gonna do when they load in a different

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,630
order and not being able really to test

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,150
that either sir you know javascript is

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,199
just the most wonderful mess in the

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,500
world when it comes to programming

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,080
anything it's just a living hell I don't

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,919
know you know I mean I wrote it was just

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,659
you know words fail me

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,860
you know piling up all the stuff and

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,180
then the good news is that they create

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,490
these tools that make it very easy to

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,810
upgrade bits of the middle of it where

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,050
upgrade means break all of the

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,830
invariants I coded up above so obscure

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,039
things no longer work but anyway um I

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,270
digress

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,770
either way wait till the JavaScript

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,740
loaded before sending your post message

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,459
otherwise you yeah you might have a bad

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,380
experience so don't do that good

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,940
so I mention the check file info thing

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,560
there's a whole load of things that here

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,120
like say so one of the things we have a

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,770
thing called secure view I forget if I

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,209
go to slide about it but the idea is

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,550
that the daintily at the document leave

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:47,100
your site you know you have employees in

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,050
in in wherever they are North Korea

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,959
because you employ North Koreans great

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,829
great move and yeah you don't want to

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,570
send them the whole document you just

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,760
want to show show them it and you want

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,380
to you know watermark it so that you can

00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,130
be sure it's them and if they take

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,750
pictures of the screen

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,700
you know it's got their name all over it

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,370
this kind of thing um so you can turn

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,650
off printing downloading saving copy

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,260
paste or all of this stuff because that

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,360
all happens server-side and so you can

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,280
just hard disable this stuff which is

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,600
kind of cool and anyway so there's all

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,350
sorts of these different options you can

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,840
do copy paste because actually you're

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,970
sending pixels to the client not actual

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,250
content it's relatively easy to do that

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,690
like there really is no the Dom is all

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,820
on the server not in the not in the

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,770
client which has many advantages in

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,940
terms of performance and you want to do

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,430
the slow thing not on your mobile phone

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,310
but on the fast server in the data

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,010
center probably what do we have here

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,360
enable owner termination see I don't

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,090
know ken do you know that this is candy

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,320
here's who's awesome and you know

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,810
develop them and manager for Calabria

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,280
online you know look at that you'll see

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,140
extra users oh yes so your you know your

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,190
avatar and your email and little things

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,500
so you can then start to integrate with

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,450
your crazy chat and lalala you can do

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,920
all that sort of nice nice integration

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,560
stuff yeah csps only wonderful for

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,310
breaking images and watermarking stuff

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,010
for watermarking tiles oh yeah I think

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,600
this is a great thing you know so it's

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,800
very important so let me show you some

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,700
of the other other people that have done

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,170
this just to prove that it's not

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,030
impossible you know

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,680
so you arrow are great they they're Java

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,510
programmers so that's good actually

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,070
having used Java scripts you discover

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,600
that Java is a beautiful programming

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,700
language which is funny isn't it you

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,760
know cuz I was a baroque mess but anyway

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,200
they were um so II group where they were

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,390
doing some stuff here you know just

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,450
embedded into their their tool their

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,100
frame um collab who a company that's in

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,190
Switzerland to do a secure on site

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,300
on-premise hosted stuff and next grad

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,580
obviously you've just heard your sis

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,470
talk a beautiful integration there with

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,350
all sorts of things avatars and

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,900
templates and all sorts of all sorts of

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,130
nice features sharing built-in and so on

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm cloud similarly and another PHP app

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,900
pi do as again a PHP but another

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,210
integrations there a roof some random

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,070
other you know company producing stuff

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,500
doing this a matter most for your

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,410
education educational needs

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,700
chatting needs rather um this is not a

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,900
very pretty integration I need to talk

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,720
to Corey when I see him

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,730
if I see him to try and fix that and so

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,020
we love to help people do that so you

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,480
know when you're struggling and it

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,600
doesn't work it might not be you you

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,760
know so so come and come and grab me or

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,770
someone else and we can help you get

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,690
this integrated and then you know

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,010
there's all sorts of commercial stuff

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,230
around there that we can talk about

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,910
thank you sir you cannot make any

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,590
sustainable open-source engagement let's

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,960
say what else

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,520
say Culebra line for to say so this is

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,750
sort of shipping in code now but these

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,140
are basically new features we've added

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,780
in the last six nine nine months

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,670
something like that so what do we see

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,440
here well I'm so we got the sidebars now

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,060
and impress so this is being tunneled

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,920
through from effectively the PC

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,510
application and we're moving these two

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,450
years some native widgets I think

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,160
probably in the next year or so but hey

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,990
it works really nicely for now so you

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,340
have really quite rich functionality

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,560
there all these different panels you can

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,960
be fiddling with a shadow of your text

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,600
box and so on it's just a huge a wealth

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,430
of functionality there animations I

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,780
don't think anyone else has configurable

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,520
animations in their online office suite

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,870
at the moment you know and all of that

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,750
all of the key stuff that you want then

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,280
around presentations so you can you can

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,710
actually make a presentation master

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,240
pages master page editing Google Docs

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,020
doesn't do it Microsoft Office doesn't

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,030
do it

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,920
none of our competition does you know so

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,690
it's just but again bringing that

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,670
richness of the functionality from the

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,860
office suite through to the to the

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,720
browser and I hope of course is here

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,490
that we we end up with a full function

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,070
office suite in the browser that's easy

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,260
to deploy centrally and it's not just

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,200
then selling ownCloud to someone it's

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,810
it's also getting rid of that legacy PC

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,670
installed nastiness as well so you can

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,290
start to actually you know in good

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,130
conscience move to a fully web delivered

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,170
extremely secure on-premise hosted

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,300
digitally sovereign solution which is

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,920
nice but what else a nice new chart

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,690
editing sidebar so you can click on your

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,630
charts and get different different types

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,860
of charts conditional formats so often

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,150
people have these dropdowns and they

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,730
they claim conditional formatting is

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,930
done you know pick one and be happy but

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,280
of course conditional formatting is

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,470
insanely complicated and you know

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,780
wouldn't it be nice if you could fix it

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,640
so it looks like you want it function

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,590
Wizards so you can remember what the

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,890
seventeenth parameter to that really bad

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,050
method does

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:33,020
and so on color correction of images

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,880
nice UI handles for sizing tables and

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,220
selecting them improved spreadsheet

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,750
stuff for auto fills I wouldn't be nice

00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,190
if you write january/february and use

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,720
fill it down it goes March April May

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,160
instead of January for every Jennifer

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,740
you know that kind of thing

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,690
ordinal suffix first second drag it down

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,750
third 4/5 you know these things are the

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,130
basics that our competitors are just

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,930
anyway they don't have the rich engine

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,000
behind the scenes to do because that

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,110
seems easy isn't it first second third

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,480
fourth fifth but actually when you get

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,810
to you know the plethora of languages we

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,070
support 119 live translations for

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,840
languages hundred and forty-five people

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,940
working four and a half thousand

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,420
translators working on a translation

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,220
codebase

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,990
things are more complex pop-ups for URLs

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,550
add to make them nice and then bring you

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,200
all of that to mobile so previously we

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,520
are we try to provide more desktop

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,930
experience on the phone so you could

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,030
zoom dialogues and things that was

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,490
pretty yucky um so we went for a more

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,680
feature week as and we limit the

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,410
features to say what our competition do

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,420
and that's a bit crazy but anyway so a

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,920
viewer by default you see some of these

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,540
these sort of fairly familiar you know

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,820
click the button to play the

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,470
presentation undo redo this is all

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,350
they're all open source it's in the App

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,080
Store or collabora office mobile beta

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,250
you can store it and play with it and

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,130
then you know this kind of one-handed

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,410
you know big chunky stuff scrollable but

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,680
these are actually the sidebars but

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:58,400
wrapped and redone with native HTML

00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,800
widgets with CSS and you know nicely

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,810
they can all mix hopefully similarly I

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,740
show you the chart type sidebar earlier

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,520
this is the same guy

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,960
but now scrollable and hierarchical and

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,040
unlisted and similarly for these these

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,590
guys too pretty many years yeah lots of

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,920
individual features I'm running out of

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,200
time I will have some time for questions

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm new theming so yeah this is a nice

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,800
bug I should get a better screenshot but

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,060
anyway the idea is you can use SVG just

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,300
theme the native stuff so it looks

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,330
crisper and prettier and works works

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,900
better doing a similar thing for iOS for

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,030
tablets

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,300
done with an finis who is a cool partner

00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,440
of ours in Switzerland and one of the

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,529
great things about this partner was that

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,729
we saw the product with the

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,409
good faith to the customer who then

00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:46,499
decided they wanted to work offline and

00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,839
that's a bit difficult for a you know

00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:50,339
it's kind of minor feature though you

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,769
need to add so anyway they get a free

00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,869
port of Libre Office to iOS for the

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,319
price of fur anyway let's not do that

00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,699
again um but they go you got it you're

00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,949
gonna please the customer having you at

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,989
the end of the day um so we do all sorts

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,729
of cool monitoring so Prometheus Bay

00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,769
text-based polling stuff I don't know

00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:10,439
why people like to poll I think it sucks

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,909
but polling is cool um I prefer the

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:13,349
WebSocket thing we implemented first so

00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:15,059
you can get live data coming in here

00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,499
about documents opens who's done it and

00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,939
whatever from your cluster so the

00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:19,439
cluster will connect out your monitoring

00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:23,669
server give you a WebSocket and let you

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:25,409
control it lots of other stuff much

00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,269
richer copy and paste things new

00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,279
dialogues

00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,479
yeah lots of anonymize logging so you

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,649
had all this nice logging so you can

00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,569
work out what's going on and then you

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,719
encrypt it also you can't anymore with

00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:38,219
gdpr compliance they call this obviously

00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:40,439
have third party penetration testing to

00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:43,349
make sure it's all you know safe and

00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:48,779
good better performance PDF rendering

00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:50,279
simpler code for your threads yeah ah so

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,319
legal sovereignty donor your documents

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,209
out of your site highly secure lock it

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,849
up on your premise right stick your

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,739
document in its own chroot with almost

00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,019
no file system nothing executable in

00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:02,819
there set comp BPF filtering all the

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,279
system calls around it I'm underneath

00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,629
that you know load crash testing in you

00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,319
know we've got a better Coverity school

00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:10,949
than the Linux kernel 0.00 questionable

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,919
if that's useful

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,600
um Libre Office kits so basically what

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,879
about this giant thing is it is it

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,669
secure we have never had a security

00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:23,069
issue inside these documents that could

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,869
have broken out like that so it's it's

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,299
pretty kind pretty cool and you can

00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,439
really be confident that it's a picture

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,450
of secure view I didn't if you can see

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,549
the watermark in the background here but

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,049
yeah the contrast is not ideal but you

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,549
can see it here of course we try and

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,320
work on all all kinds of background and

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,720
this is a very simple elegant model

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,149
against Microsoft's Microsoft's model

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,460
for DRM and sharing documents is that

00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,899
they sign everything they sign your you

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,610
know the TPA their key ships in your

00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,809
BIOS they sign your bootloader they sign

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,820
your operating system they sign your

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,340
office suite and then they'll give you

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,000
the document the key for your document

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,580
from there

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,290
cloud so you can unlock your documents

00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,700
and be able to read it because they're

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,780
now convinced that your whole stack from

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,650
the hardware app is actually safe

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,600
anything that's a great model in terms

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,890
of digital sovereignty I think having a

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,960
single American company hold all the

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,600
keys for your documents and sign

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,370
everything is is just not very elegant

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,260
let's say it's not very simple it can't

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,330
be federated and it has this massive

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,780
central point of failure and we can do

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,250
better in a simple way that's federated

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,840
that you own that you control you can

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,580
decide who you trust who you collaborate

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,500
with and who you give what permissions

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,900
to and we think that's extremely elegant

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,730
our competition instantly claimed to do

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,700
some of these things but it's all

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,770
enforced in JavaScript on the client so

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,510
hard to circumvent by pressing f12

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,640
obviously yeah highly scalable very

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,710
simple architecture no database no

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,290
separate message barse no shared data

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,250
storage scalability one on one using it

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,380
for millions of users literally yeah

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,750
compensable operations suck if you want

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,370
to know more talk to me about it

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,630
45,000 users well actually don't talk to

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,420
me about it just consider sorting a

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,770
spreadsheet and changing a cell and

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,900
trying to work out what the implications

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,670
of changing the cell are by walking the

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,640
entire dependency graph that could be

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,830
vast to see if this cell change effects

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,080
anything that might impact the salt and

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,510
now try composing these operations

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,710
across each other okay and when you've

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,240
sorted that out you can come and tell me

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,360
how great operational transforms are

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,100
good so we just do everything live as it

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,740
happens and that turns out to be simple

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,780
slick bulletproof and not have any oh I

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,440
can't synchronize across my cluster

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,660
properly um so in terms of CPU usage

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,740
this is pretty simple 45,000 users using

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,180
it their spikes of about 6k users online

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,860
occasionally it runs on the spare

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,070
Hardware left over or the side of the

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,320
massive next cloud cluster so like the

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,980
balance of hardware spent versus the

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,780
database metadata storages trivial do it

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,770
doing the data center not on your mobile

00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,120
if it's complicated and that's it so our

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,740
mission is to make open-source rock and

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,090
hopefully we're doing it we'd love to

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,280
work with you to integrate with you all

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,400
the efforts so thank you you'd be very

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,590
good

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,170
I think we have about half a minute for

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,090
questions doing this all right

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,280
no.5 we have five minutes for questions

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,450
ah I'm very happy that's good I could

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,980
have gone more slowly let me tell you

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:40,240
more conclusions than me sir your

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:41,590
question yes see obviously you don't

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,870
want to start your document the bit

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,070
inside the frame well maybe you do but

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,990
if you'd use the office suite to do that

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,750
so rendering that on the server is not a

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,270
problem in terms of theming the widgets

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,760
there's SVG for doing the icon so you

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,950
can fiddle around with that's fine it's

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,960
a subset of SVG because we don't really

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,910
want the animated JavaScript stuff

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,110
running on the server there obviously

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,510
it's a very restricted subset so I'm you

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,429
can't CSS everything is the answer but

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:21,040
on the mobile it's much more Kenny can't

00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:27,700
be given good answer can you open

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,530
document editors dev room yep so yes if

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,420
you want to go to that Pedro who is our

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,920
designer we'll show you how to do the

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,230
whole works and if not we just slides

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,780
afterwards um say yes say there's a lot

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,850
you can do and there are some limits to

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,590
particular around the legacy dialogues I

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,860
think in a year as we start to move

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,190
those to being more client-side rendered

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,140
HTML dialogues then knock yourself out

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,640
let's let's do every bad idea of blink

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,500
tags and you know whatever else and then

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,690
just pile it in and then yeah but yeah

00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,600
yeah it's it's easy easy to do good

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,600
question another question sir

00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:13,220
sure Oh the pay customer is very easy

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,340
you just mail it to support a clever or

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,380
officer come oh yes how do I file report

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,640
bugs so if you just mail us it

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,730
effectively creates a ticket as you do

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,179
that and we track that ticket yes to a

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,650
degree

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,140
yeah so that's kind of split between us

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,500
and next Klout if you're having problems

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,340
with that cab poke pick me just just

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,159
email me or mails

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:41,210
just mail me it's probably best and then

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,890
we'll we'll sort it out but yes yes they

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,140
mean it next time moves at a great pace

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,490
and innovates quickly let's say say I

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:52,280
think this yeah there's things we can

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,080
things we can fix that but yeah do love

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,090
to you yeah you I'll give you a card in

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,090
a second other questions sir

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:21,270
sure so so so so so is it working fine

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,270
you want to do monitoring essentially

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,110
yep so when you do a make run like this

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,110
it gives you these these wonderful

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,920
things here and so if you just launched

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:39,220
the link then you have you know an

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,070
office suite you know and if you have a

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,720
new window you can do this and you can

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,220
see you know collaborative editing or

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,200
you know whatever it is you like right

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,000
so so that works reasonably and of

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,290
course there's an admin console so if

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,270
you as I say if you like the whole

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,270
here's a whole lot of quite boring

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,430
variables saying you can do that or you

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,080
can go to the the live admin console

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,820
that'll tell you there's you know this

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,430
many documents open and who's who's

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,010
doing it and okay so this integration is

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:17,890
not cool for the files and the users are

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:19,060
online and so on okay potentially I'm

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,260
the problem with this command of course

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,430
is for a development edition we're not

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,490
really eager for people to be able to

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,230
load things off the file system normally

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,610
so that's kind of disabled in and builds

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,380
but you can go to the admin console if

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,380
you're a glutton for punishment and I am

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,440
so if you give the user one kill which

00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,790
is a great great API and then it

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,220
essentially dumps its entire internal

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,950
state all of its sockets all of the file

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,800
descriptors who they go to what's in the

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,680
tile cache you know when it last saved

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,470
all the permissions about it and that's

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,900
quite nice for various reasons this is

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,820
used to debug complex threading

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,630
situations and in consequence it takes

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,310
almost no locks almost all the time

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,450
that's absolutely fine and it's

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,820
extremely useful when someone's

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,480
deadlocked in a thread however it may

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,420
crash your server so I it doesn't crash

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,920
mine at least very often but just be

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,460
aware that sending a user one is

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,310
extremely powerful shop develop a tool

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,670
yeah

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,930
sounds good excellent thank you very

00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:29,289
much

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:29,289
