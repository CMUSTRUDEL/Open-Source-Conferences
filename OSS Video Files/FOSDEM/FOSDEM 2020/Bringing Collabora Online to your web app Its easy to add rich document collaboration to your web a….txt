The Collabora Online code-base can bring the power of LibreOffice into
an iframe inside your web app. Come and hear how this works, how to integrate
secure, collaborative document editing with your software, and about all the
latest greatest work going on there.
Collabora Online uses a WOPI-like protocol, and it is rather simple to integrate.
Come hear about the total of three REST methods you need for a simple
integration, as well as the wealth of options to control how collaboration works.


Hear about some of our integrations into Nextcloud, Kolab,
Mattermost, Moodle, ownCloud, and many more.


See the internals of Collabora Online, and how you can get involved with
building, debugging, and developing it, and checkout some of the new features
for Mobile and PC browser that we've been working on to make life better
for our users.
