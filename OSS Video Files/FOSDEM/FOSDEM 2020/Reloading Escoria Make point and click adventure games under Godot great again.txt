Escoria is a Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with MIT-Licenced Godot Engine. Since its release, Godot Engine changed a lot at fast pace while Escoria code was still based on old Godot 1.x features.


In this presentation, I'll present the current state of Escoria and discuss the process of rewrite as a Godot Engine plugin. It'll cover architecture and design, allowing adventure game creators to use Godot Engine as a full-featured editor for their adventure game.
Escoria is a Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with MIT-Licenced Godot Engine. It was initially developed for the adventure game The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy® and later streamlined for broader usages and open sourced as promised to the backers of the Dog Mendonça Kickstarter campaign. Since its release, Godot Engine changed a lot at fast pace while Escoria code was still based on old Godot 1.x features. It is more a collection of dedicated scripts than a proper Godot Engine layer designed for point and click adventure games. Evolving Escoria is quite a big task, so it might be better to actually start it over with a new project architecture while keeping its most interesting features in the process.

	00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,490
because after this yeah starting over I

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,590
forget you and you the microphone so

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:27,509
yeah hurry up adventure game framework

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:30,810
in there Godot let's do that again does

00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:34,739
this work yeah okay so starting over

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,250
from from scratch this this adventure

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,780
for a game framework on Android oh so

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,440
adventure games and Anatomy

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,360
at first we will I will focus on what's

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,430
adventure adventure adventure game

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,780
creators actually need what do they

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,930
require in order to create the again and

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,910
what do they actually don't want when

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,760
they are focusing on creating the game

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,060
itself then I'll talk more about is

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,030
Korea introduce it a little bit more

00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,189
talk about its current status and what

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,689
we what we can do to make it actually

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,149
actually better and complete so what's

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,240
another adventure game basically a few

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,859
elements that you will find in every in

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,579
every adventure game point-and-click

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,530
adventure games of course well there

00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,679
there were a lot of adventure games in

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:34,049
the history so mostly focus on those you

00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:36,420
can you can see here most of the time

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,789
you will be playing in an animated

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,210
character the main player that can move

00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:46,079
around and over scene change go from

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,619
room to room etc so basically walks you

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,799
can find also items NPCs to talk with

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,380
those NPCs are of course we are reacting

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,630
to actions action that's and that you

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,219
can find here on certain you eyes

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,439
sometimes uncertain your eyes you won't

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,520
find them depends depending on the game

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,250
you will find them under the right click

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,220
to change the actual action to perform

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,330
on the on the game objects such as

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,340
talking give up use give etcetera

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,670
other elements that you will find in

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,300
almost every adventure games mostly 2d

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,160
of course here puzzles using the using

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,540
all the items that you will be able to

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,580
find in in the rooms which means of

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,980
course having an innovate inventory to

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,600
keep all these items into into your

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,360
pockets which is funny because usually

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,720
your pockets are that big and you could

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,640
put a whole ship into it

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,270
dialogues of course as I said you will

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,690
meet a lot of a lot of people NPCs to

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,440
talk with into your into the games in

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:03,030
order to follow the whole history which

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,520
is interesting and it's totally part of

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,610
the story that you want to that you want

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,870
to tell the player and also in are also

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,960
in order to tell a story you'll need

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:19,650
cutscenes that reward the player when as

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,020
he advances the story of the game that's

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:28,170
what the player is looking for when when

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:31,530
he advances the game so first of all we

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,590
are talking video games here and it is

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,120
mostly commonly accepted that video

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,220
games are no kind of an artistic thing

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,290
so we are talking with art we are

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,420
working with artists here what do

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,850
artists actually need to work on video

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,850
games like this first of all they again

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,120
need they need to be responsible of the

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:56,510
lifetime of the FLDS sets we are

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,220
actually creating for a further game

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,130
from the beginning from the black canvas

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,040
to the sprite that will be in the actual

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,620
game they need no dependency on the

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,830
programmers they just want to draw their

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,380
art put it in the game and don't ask any

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,109
program now sir please can you program

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,480
update this sprite with the new asset I

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,120
just created in the date is again which

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,690
needs were compiling all the time boring

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,280
stuff for the for the the artists they

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,600
just wanted to be in the game and do not

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,330
require anything

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,700
and of course that's the the most

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,000
important thing since they are video

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,480
game artists their medium is the video

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,150
game itself of course they will draw all

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,670
their assets in the dedicated software's

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,110
such as being such as creators of such

00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,840
as a Photoshop whatever but they will

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,050
then export them and put them in the

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,690
video games directly otherwise it stays

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,730
on the on their blank page and the

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:08,430
European Garrett is now that was for an

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,250
that was for the game artists now what

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,830
do you gain designers need the orders

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,500
are not the same these persons are the

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,100
one who actually writes this to arrive

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,420
the story and turn it as scripts that

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,060
work in the that make the game work as

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,490
the Java scripts are processed and as

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,580
the scripts are used according to the

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,670
actions of the of the player make the

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,560
game advance change the game state and

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,950
there are all this kind of stuff

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,230
so game designers basically create their

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,350
story by building rooms using the

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,290
backgrounds from the artists and they

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,210
put on on this navigable air areas for

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:56,330
the play of to know where the player is

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:59,880
able to walk or not at spot spot areas

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,370
this is more some kind of UI stuff that

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,810
it can serve the story as well since you

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,600
want to to be able to to define these

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,700
areas to be focusable so the player can

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,110
just look at them but maybe not take

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,970
them use just use items on it and then

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,230
that still not take them not push down

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,630
etc items of course trigger areas

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,610
sometimes you are in your stories you

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,100
want to be able to have the player

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,390
walking in an area and trigger another

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,400
event and for example started cutting

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,820
NPCs as well so basically this is

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,220
accessing the access in and influence

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,430
the game logic but not too much because

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,580
if you give the game designer too much

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,650
freedom then it's it first it would be

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,600
more difficult to for him because he

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,200
will have to manage so many things and

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:59,670
he wants to focus on the game logic and

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,040
only only his story but still complex in

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,270
us enough to for him to be able to

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,950
create and write interesting stories and

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:13,500
and focus on this so now what do game

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:18,660
creators in general don't want to make

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,460
nest with first of all and I believe

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,970
that they don't want you to care about

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,550
the UI you know I mean they need to care

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,020
about the UI because they want to know

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,880
what it will look like they want to

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,430
change the theme they want to know to

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,670
place it on on the screen that you want

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,500
to define there it's basic behavior but

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,120
in an event and in an adventure game you

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,880
have the inventory you have all the

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,800
dialogues the verbs actions that you can

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,350
find on the UI UI but they should be

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,920
already done and the and the game

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:56,340
designer should only define their look

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,830
not their actual behavior what it does

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,360
behind the scenes it's not interesting

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,090
for him so only defined there are

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,300
parents eventually special behaviors

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,980
rest it's too technical

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,010
so you want to they want to care about

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,040
how characters actually move movement of

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,730
the characters is some some kinds that

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,810
can it's a very specific task to be

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,540
managed in in the game engine nowadays

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,910
game engines can can deal with this

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,100
pretty easily with a lot of techniques

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:34,070
you can have path finding staff

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,110
navigation whatsoever so the easiest

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,760
manner for the game designer to do this

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:46,440
is to just define the areas the Wallkill

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,960
areas and that's all also the same for

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,910
the animations that you want to define

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,660
the animations and forget about them

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,520
create them name them call them call

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,050
them by scripts of course but don't

00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,760
manage the

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,839
the animations are actually started in

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,790
the in the engine don't manage the their

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,550
timings this is creating the animation

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,709
but don't manage that the this between

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,050
the timing of the animation and the

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,140
timing of all the management of all the

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,820
events of the game and so on there are a

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,720
lot of stuff like this I didn't talk

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,880
about sound for example so we are

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,540
talking about a Godot framework here so

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,910
good or does doesn't provide the doesn't

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,220
Godot provided already all the stuff you

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,350
require to her to do this like sprites

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,890
animated sprites animation player to do

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:40,890
the animations so everything

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,050
everything's ok GD squid which which

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:47,120
allows you to create your spritz spritz

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:51,230
yoga your game manage the inputs of the

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,940
of the player everything is fine but

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,040
it's already too low level for the

00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,060
creator's so we need more simplicity and

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,910
that's the purpose of face Korea so what

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,610
is it is Korea this Korea is currently

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,670
in its current state a set of tool and

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:13,170
create mostly script that are built on

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:16,800
top of Godot and it they define a basic

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,829
workflow that means the the switz out

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,209
here and you will as a game creator we

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:26,730
just have to put them on your nodes and

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:29,550
the end that's all and after that we you

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,649
will have to use another way to script

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,220
your game logic it's not to be a tool

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,709
for teams artists in one hand game

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,450
designers in the other hand and it's

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,790
been built on tougher on top of it in

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,829
order to forget about the program nation

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:49,800
stuff it's already done for you so it's

00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:53,040
a collection of scripts as I said to

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,930
apply and go to do scenes and note then

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,399
about the scripting part that allows you

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,140
to I actually make your make your action

00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,050
the actions that you will see the

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,149
dialogues as well this kind of things

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,610
that you can have here those are the

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,960
actions look use this would be a script

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,240
that you could put on a red bed I

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,560
- documentary item read that for example

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:21,250
so the action look basically makes the

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,670
player to say oh a nice red dead fine

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,120
and also on other action if you want to

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,430
action verb use on this red dead the

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,590
player would just say something else in

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,400
the same way you could you will have a

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,640
lot of commands in there in this

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,430
scripting language to allow you to add

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,500
add the object in yerevan inventory use

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,550
you know the object on another object

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,740
and manage this using States this is not

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,560
exactly the purpose of this presentation

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,170
because that's the that's the way it

00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,550
works and this is not meant to be

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,440
changed it already already works the

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,540
nice thing about Xperia is that it

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,320
already cared about all the other stuff

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,730
ice I said before the games elements are

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,800
the games elements and the managers

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,010
everything worse items navigations

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,370
animations you you can already forget it

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,660
because it's basically already works

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,760
just to show you a game that's already

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,340
using a scoria professional game that

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,800
was out in 2016 this game is the

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,640
interactive adventures of the under

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,040
sound in pizza boy which started

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,290
development in May 2012

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,530
it's a classic point-and-click game play

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,400
basically so it's been it just fits the

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,730
the purpose of the other framework it

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,670
was made by only six person then twelve

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,470
in total so it was it's Korea was

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,250
actually created during the development

00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,610
of this this game in particular it was a

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,950
Kickstarter and the game was tying to

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,250
the plate publisher the idea was to

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,910
release s.korea as free software under

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:15,880
MIT license after the game was actually

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:19,450
released which it was so that's that's

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,390
good but that's not enough we we have to

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,450
know that as Corey I was written already

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,760
a long time ago it was

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,670
under Goodwin Jean one point X if I'm

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,520
not wrong and now go dojo is just

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,390
version 3.2 seems like two or three days

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,710
and a lot of things happened between in

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:44,370
this period of time a lot of features

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:48,930
made their appearance in the Indy engine

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:52,620
such as editor plugins and just to name

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,140
one not only this problem is that s

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,990
Korea s Korea's maintenance is not very

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,760
easy because the backend the backend

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,350
scripts that make the whole framework

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,960
work are very big it's a loan it's a

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,420
whole load of off script and it's not

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,070
easy for this for someone like me who

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,720
arrived after the development of this

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,440
game I wasn't the development the

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,890
developer of a nor neither historian nor

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,830
Doug Mendoza game IRA I arrived just

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,810
after when the the framework was

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:30,900
released and it's really difficult to

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:33,750
dive into this base of code so actually

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,610
you can run some music anime animations

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,280
modify game States but it's made of

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,460
hacks almost everywhere to just tweak

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,400
something something that some problems

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,070
that you can find because of some good

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,040
old bugs you can have this in labels for

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:55,440
example it's very difficult to to to use

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,600
so we are in in my opinion I need more

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,550
flexibility currently if you want to

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,680
make an actual team Z this is a scene

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,660
which you would call a room in another

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,360
tool for example so basically a

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,690
background with the wall cable array is

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,600
you have them yeah you have the

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,700
background here you have the terrain and

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,890
the this steering node is actually the

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,410
wall cable area and all the other

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,430
elements here are basically sprites

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,670
other game elements the players here

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,990
then you put everything in this way but

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,070
certain elements such as the bedroom at

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,570
the background in the chair not

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,939
mandatory and the fact is those names

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,189
need to be

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,159
the right order on the in the century so

00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:45,319
bad background need needs to be needs to

00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,409
be in first terrain just after that you

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:51,439
need to have this very name this is not

00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,869
very flexible so this must change in

00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:56,569
order to let the the crater make the

00:15:53,869 --> 00:16:02,689
thing all the things the way he wants it

00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:05,539
to be you know in order to because of

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:08,629
this it's hard to add new features some

00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:11,869
new features have have been had added in

00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:14,329
in the first few months such as the

00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:17,659
shadows under the other characters we're

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,369
speaking to these shadows here you can

00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,089
also have lights in your in your

00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:27,649
backgrounds and certain one of our user

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,109
was wanted and a feature so that lights

00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:32,439
actually had an impact on the shadows

00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:34,729
under the under the player usually

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:37,189
shadows are just part of the sprites and

00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:40,849
that's all he wanted to he wanted

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:42,859
something to be more more dynamic which

00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:44,689
is the which was difficult so we just

00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:47,559
had to find some or something but again

00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:51,199
this is very happy to me

00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,349
so what what are my goal in order to

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,149
evolve this career in its current state

00:16:53,349 --> 00:17:00,199
for first of all simplify the usability

00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,069
it's already very easy to use but you

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,169
have to

00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:07,100
you basically have to read the manual

00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:09,500
and a great manual has already been

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,480
written by floss manuals which you can

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,509
find on the internet for free it was

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,919
it's a great a great example of a game

00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,970
of a point and click game that you're

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,909
able to do with it keep it as simple as

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,179
possible and maintain in order to appeal

00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:28,909
more people to add new features fixed

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,519
bugs because there are bugs not only go

00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:33,740
do bugs but also ask or headaches but

00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,830
also of course don't make it a new

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,950
adventure game a new adventure games to

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,529
do or visionnaire in the undergrowth in

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,309
order to make this and the idea is to

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:49,990
make a score yeah and an editor plugin

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,770
making this we will enable us to

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,830
integrate

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,620
s.korea directly into the editor and

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,529
also enable us to create new tools such

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,880
as a net and s.korea scripting editor so

00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,669
you will be able to write your SQL

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,890
scripts directly into Godot which is not

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,929
possible currently and also all sorts of

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:14,559
theäôve idea that you can have here for

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:17,480
example for existing user scripts to add

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,240
new functionality without having to

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,450
modify to edit the actual courier source

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,080
code

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:30,289
this is s.korea a whole bunch of scripts

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:35,289
in one folder named global as you can

00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:37,940
imagine this is this is a pain so I

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:44,059
wanted to do more to look more and more

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:46,130
like this more more homogeneous folders

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,799
basically it's sorting all the source

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,409
code but it also means reorganize the

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:59,120
functions instance into the into the

00:18:51,409 --> 00:19:01,429
scripts which is a lot of works this has

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,010
impacts on the relationships on the

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,570
relationship between the user Sindh and

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:12,020
this Korea so basically we need to make

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,830
them a little bit more smarter and try

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,440
to guess the guest what what the what

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,940
the game creator wanted to do when he

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,380
created his scene I'm trying to go a

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,520
little bit faster because I take your I

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,880
took a little too much time but you got

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,250
to be very simple I want only once they

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,250
use the user note they're going to the

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,789
second scenes that the user created to

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,039
have two tasks only receive user inputs

00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:47,179
and I need them to as Korea s Korea

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:50,960
manages them does his stuff and gives

00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:53,840
back those notes actual actions to

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,909
perform so just move the note play

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,880
animation on the note and that's all I

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:03,649
currently you can see some game logic

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,360
yeah you can see some game logic inside

00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:09,230
though the spirits that

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,230
that you that are currently in those

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:17,840
streets which is not something something

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:19,760
we want and to finish like on this the

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,700
example scenes currently scoria comes

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:27,380
with a few examples teens which are

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:30,200
crappy actually this is the this is the

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,960
only one i started something over that

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,770
yeah we want definitely something

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,850
different so in order to do it to do

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,260
this well basically we will make it from

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,380
scratch

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,419
this means make multiple dimensions

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,270
showing different features of the

00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:53,360
obvious korea that can be animation in

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,919
the background one scene side-scrolling

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,040
another scene this way the if one room

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,080
one example room is able to showcase

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,900
only one feature at the time it's easier

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:10,220
further for the users to dive into as

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,730
korea and use it and of course make it a

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,370
little bit more beautiful because yeah

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:21,559
if if I just if I see this for the first

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:24,260
time I'd run away so yeah that's the

00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:28,100
basic idea so of course this is a lot of

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,799
work that's a lot of work and it has

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:35,179
just started I should have started this

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,870
a few time ago but yeah life open-source

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:41,860
it this kind of stuff so there is no

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:46,040
working branch yet it will happen soon

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,590
if you already have used this Korea if

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,440
you're already using a story guys expect

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,179
some comparative breakage everywhere

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,220
because it's it will basically change

00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:01,820
completely but in the end this time by

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,770
starting from scratch I'm really

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,480
intrigued are integrating all the

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,290
existing source code cleaning it

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,590
removing all but all hacks portion by

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,169
portion and all that you have it working

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,930
exactly the exact same way as before so

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:22,050
it's transparent but

00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,300
but it it will be totally changed behind

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:28,740
the scenes so of course no estimated

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,750
date of delivery so so for those of you

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,640
who are already working Waiting for

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,640
Godot that's one more things to wait for

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,670
so what you can do currently just to

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,010
finish on this you can drop by on IRC

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm usually idling on Godot engine

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,160
s.korea

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,310
there are some people who who are idling

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,850
there as well so you can share your

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,360
ideas and suggestions this is the the

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,470
Astoria repository it's on the official

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:05,910
Godot engine account it was related in a

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,640
certain fashion with Godot and if you

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,930
have any idea suggestions you can also

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,320
drop down and find an issue in there

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,060
that's it

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:40,560
thanks for listening if you have any

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:43,860
questions yeah so do do we have plans

00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,470
for html5 exports actually this is not

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,390
exactly related with s.korea itself this

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:53,520
is more a good ol question to be honnest

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,800
there are plans about is HTML if I'm not

00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,200
wrong we have a paid contributor who's

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:03,510
currently working on web exports I'm not

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,190
really aware of of the current status of

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:11,540
this but this will change this since we

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,540
have some people working on this

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,700
yeah so current about this the threads

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,430
and arrangement in the in the web

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,790
browsers again the same answer and

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,290
unfortunately I'm sorry this is not

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,740
exactly the purpose of this Korea itself

00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:51,580
even though it's of course obviously

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,680
it's using its using threads but this

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,360
will have to be tested I I don't know

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,880
the current status of web exports right

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,590
now with this Korea nor will go to

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,100
engine itself because I'm not using it

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,010
myself yet so I have difficulties to

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,590
answer your questions but if you drop by

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,920
at the go-to stands maybe somebody will

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,920
be more able to answer your question yes

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,490
yeah so about the Android compatibility

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,800
and all the widgets you can use on

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,920
Android applications that's something I

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,190
have in mind indeed to make it work with

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:46,150
with Android and mobile their devices as

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:48,580
well that's that's important because in

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,620
yeah in my in my opinion indeed that's a

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,400
platform that's that suits very well

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,050
these kind of adventure games so yeah

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,480
that's something I I have in mind and I

00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,920
will try to work on Android experts as

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,320
well to make it work

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:08,560

already made for him if so that they fit
