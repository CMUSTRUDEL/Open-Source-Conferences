Data protection is an extensive and hot topic. Making sure that
whoever accesses your data has identity well established and is
authorized can be a complex and hard task. Moreover, nowadays
data tends to move around quickly between different instances of the
same service, different services and different data consumers.  This
often implies that data traverses different administrative domains. It
is key that MySQL handles, stores and replicates data complying
with the security requirements that business and regulations demand.


This session showcases the new developments in MySQL 8.0 that tighten
related replication security setups, and reduce the attack surface of
the different replication topologies. We will talk about secure
inter-server communication, encryption of replication data at rest
and the new features that make the replication applier run under a
specific security context. Come and learn about security related
replication features in MySQL 8.0.
