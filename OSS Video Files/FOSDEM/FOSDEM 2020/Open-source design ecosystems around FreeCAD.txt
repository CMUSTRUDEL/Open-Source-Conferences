Title: Open-source design ecosystems around FreeCAD
Publication date: 2020-07-14
Playlist: FOSDEM 2020
Description: 
	by Yorik van Havre and Brad Collette

At: FOSDEM 2020
https://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/freecad.webm

A walk through the different ways in which people from different areas and backgrounds use a same application (FreeCAD), and the impact this has on their workflows, and even on FreeCAD development The FreeCAD project gathers a community of developers and users coming from a very large array of specialties: Makers, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, electronics engineers, architects, opticians, graphic designers, etc. All these people using the same software is a unique opportunity to explore and build cross-discipline workflows, and have people coming from one field learn unusual ways from other fields. This constant interchange of paradigms also influences FreeCAD development itself, and connects it to other fields and applications too, to create larger ecosystems. In this talk, we will show some examples of how this happens in different areas.

hi there

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,759
i'm jorik this is brad's and we should

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,320
have been doing this with

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,720
kurt buddies stuck in in the transit so

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,520
it will be just the two of us today

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,840
um we'll give the a short presentation

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
of fricatives okay if i do the

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
introduction okay then i will

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,240
just give a short introduction of the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
project for who doesn't know it

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,719
and then we'll show a little bit of

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
example of what we do around frequent

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,559
and

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,760
uh other stuff um

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,360
so for for who doesn't know freecad yet

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,719
uh it's a 3d modeling application

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,000
um basically we

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
used to say it's a

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
3d application made to build objects

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,840
that will be built in the real world

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
to make the difference with like

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,490
applications

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
that are used to make animation or or

00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,320
[Music]

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
movies or some stuff like that which is

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,880
not the focus of freecad

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,560
because it has all those precision tools

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,600
to make really precise uh things such as

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,799
the thing it's really made to make

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,400
such objects from people use it to make

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
small electronic components

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,759
up to buildings and i'm an architect

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
myself

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,000
i use it to make to to draw buildings

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
uh brad is in cnc he uses more for for

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
cnc

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,960
and there's a wide range of uses

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,840
around freecad and um basically it's

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
most of frequent users use it to do 3d

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
printing

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,040
that's it i believe it's main use

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,280
today um it began in 2002 with two

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,799
developers and now there are like

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,119
i would say 20 or 30 people committing

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,240
every week or so so it's

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,439
really growing and it's going quite well

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,439
actually

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,319
and an interesting part of it that's

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,560
what we want to showcase today

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,400
is that we have it's not really a

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
project with

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
i would say more than half of the

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
developers are not from the programming

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
background

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,599
i myself i'm an architect brad is also

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
not a formal programmer

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,000
and most of the developers didn't

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
learn programming formally they just

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
came to the project and since it's quite

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,160
easy to

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
to grab some python from it because it's

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
you have that python console all the

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,680
time everything you do in freecads uh

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,319
reflects in the python console um

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
which is around here every time you push

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,599
a button

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,000
uh you get actually a python command

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,840
printed and executed there so it's

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,280
quite uh didactic uh you use freecad and

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,400
you learn some python on the way and um

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,480
most of the developers entered

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,720
the the projects that way actually

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,800
many of them there are some professional

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,000
programmers as well

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,519
so this is what i'm going to talk about

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,920
you want to start doing okay

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,760
so i will show you a little bit of what

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
i do with fricat

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,800
i'm an architect by trade that's my day

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,800
job and

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
actually we have this architectural

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,040
studio myself

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:36,080
more four or five five people which is

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,920
almost totally open source it has no

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,400
physical location

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
all the projects we do are mostly open

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
source

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
we just keep the private data of the

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,239
clients

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,360
encrypted so all the project goes on the

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,760
github repo

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,480
and just to the private data is

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
encrypted

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,000
so probably cannot read it um

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
and this is a kind of example of what we

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
do in

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,840
we use a lot of freecad in it

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,040
but this is a property platform

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,879
from autodesk or have it just to

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
show you that whatever you do in freecad

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,799
is

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,720
quite now reliably

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,560
interchangeable with property

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,680
applications

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,120
some of our team use it because they

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,280
want it but

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,280
the the idea is not to be zealot and

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
and say we only use them persons some

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,199
clients want

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
the proprietary formats as an output so

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,400
you have to deliver the property format

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,840
but the idea is to save anything works

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
like um you can plug various components

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
in in the tool chain

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,040
and it should work seamlessly and that's

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
what we're trying to achieve

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
some are working with three cats some

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,240
are working with this and it should just

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,880
go around that's the our office it's on

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
github

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,960
and all the projects are there

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,080
and that's the latest one we've done

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,759
we're doing and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,560
it's fully developed the open source way

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:20,639
um so this these are the projects files

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:26,080
uh and it's it looks uh these are where

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:29,120
our team is located um

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
this is how we use riot for discussion

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
and

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,199
all the technical discussions happen uh

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,160
online as well

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,520
and it's this looks like common for open

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
source developers that's how

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,639
an open source project works but i can

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,199
tell you that for architecture is

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
totally uncommon people don't work that

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
way and we're

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
really trying to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
bring the open source way to an

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
architecture office

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
and freecad is really at the center at

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,919
the center of it

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
everything we learned from developing

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
free kids like reflects

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,800
in that in that office that's another

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,000
project we've been doing

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
that have last year um that's

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,919
a wiki house based uh building we've

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
built in in brazil

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,080
and it's basically um to showcase how

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
things mix around freecad uh like

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
basically

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,280
it's a house built by by people

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,639
even people without a knowledge of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
building

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,520
and it's all made of pieces of wood that

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
are cut by a cnc machine

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
and that are assembled there are numbers

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,319
printed on the on the pieces

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,160
and you have a manual that shows you

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
piece four goes into piece two

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
and you mount the thing like that

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,520
without any nail without any glue

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,880
without any any other thing just

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,639
the strength of the of the the junctions

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
uh and it's all open source we took it

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
from its original project

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,520
uh we modified it and the result is also

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
open source

00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
and

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
that's it for my butt

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
so i'm going to talk primarily about the

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,479
path workbench which is uh

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
the cam functionality and this

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
is is a really great example of what

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
yorick was talking about

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
with uh kind of a cross-discipline

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,039
participation on the project

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
this started out in 2014 and i came at

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,759
the

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
cnc cam thing as a hobbyist and was just

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,800
one of a lot of people that were

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
frustrated that there was no good

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,919
cam application uh in the open source

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,360
and particularly the linux world

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,720
and so what we did was we were already

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
users of free cad but

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,919
uh wanted the cam part as we we

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
partnered with

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,240
yorick first and uh got the the

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,759
core design for the the uh the c

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,400
plus part in um in free cad that handles

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
storage

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
of the actual tool path data and the

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
visualization

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,319
but none of the user-facing

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
functionality none of the

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
job control and tool setup and things

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,599
like that

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,680
and then that part was all written by

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,440
by me in part and then more of the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
community members coming on little by

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,319
little and at first

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,160
it was really really bad and i whined to

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,440
yorick about not knowing what i was

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
doing and he said don't worry about it

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
just

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
just just do it and somebody will come

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,719
along and fix it later

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and and i honestly that's what happened

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,919
is

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
better programmers than me came on

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,599
refactored code

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,760
and the thing started to gather users

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,880
and get some momentum behind it

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,160
so this is a the the typical workflow

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,320
we're designing uh

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
you know like a bench and you're

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
starting out with a model and then

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,959
within

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,519
free cad you have to take the components

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,120
and reorient them for cutting on a

00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,360
machine so you have to lay them out into

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
a

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
into a 2d arrangement like in the upper

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
right corner

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,480
and then generate the tool path that's

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
going to move a cutter around those

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,440
shapes

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
lifting it to clear the the spaces in

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
between the bottom left shows that

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
operating on an actual cnc

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,600
router and then the final uh product

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,320
down below

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,600
so that's that's a typical 2d or 2.5 d

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
process the where we're now starting to

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
move into

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
is a little bit more sophisticated tool

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,080
paths like

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
uh this is adaptive clearing so when

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,040
you're

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,120
you're trying to mill away metal from a

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
shape you need to keep the cutter

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
at the same level of engagement with the

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,040
material the entire time

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,080
to avoid it speeding up and slowing down

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,600
and uh

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,360
and breaking and so forth and so you're

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,320
seeing a much more sophisticated tool

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
path

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
in the upper left that was uh to mill an

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
aluminum block that's used as a brand on

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,640
a wooden

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,240
cover this is another area where we're

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
moving into this is a

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,399
fourth axis where you've got a shape

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,480
that needs to be milled on multiple

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
sides and so we're rotating it

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
um i'm cutting a piece of foam uh in the

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
upper right

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,120
and then so the the tool path has to

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,839
recalculate for each

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
position as we rotate the part around

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,079
this is

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
where we're now calculating surfaces and

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
doing more

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
more smoothing passes or in the case of

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,480
the one on the left where

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,160
we want to do a regular operation but we

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
want to do it on multiple faces of a

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
part

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
so you need to reorient the part on a

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
fourth axis or a fifth axis

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,160
well the tool paths that you're seeing

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
here the work that was done is by one of

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,320
the newer developers that has joined and

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,040
he's a spanish teacher

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
in oklahoma and he does this as a hobby

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
and

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
it's surprising how much he's been able

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,440
to move it forward

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,279
you know with a little bit of coaching

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,519
and then just you know

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:07,040
guts and determination so

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
this is one other area one of our other

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
developers

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,920
who's a real programmer a serious

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,160
programmer has

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,320
has wanted to go one step farther and

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,079
integrate direct control of the cnc

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
machine within freecad

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,720
so instead of the traditional you set up

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
a tool path and then you post process it

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
and you get a g-code file

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,959
and then you take that over to the cnc

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,760
machine and load the g-code file and run

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,560
it

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,079
what he can do with this is from freecad

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,800
he can connect directly to

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,360
a cnc machine that's running machine kit

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
and

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
select the the path job that he wants to

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
run

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
and the numbers that you're seeing in

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,720
the top left of the 3d window

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
that's the dro the position coming

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,760
directly from the machine

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,639
so the the indicator um

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
in the 3d window on the kind on the left

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,160
side

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,000
is the the cutter position within that

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
window and when he runs the job you'll

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
actually see the cutter move and follow

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,880
the path that's generated

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
so this is you know now a developer who

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,079
came

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,880
in initially for one little feature has

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,880
started to

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,720
you know make bigger and bigger

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
contributions and now his contributions

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
are getting outside

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,680
of the path um cam workbench and getting

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,920
into other aspects of free cat as well

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,320
and that's really a very typical process

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,720
the thing about cam is that the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,880
community is running a wide variety

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,200
variety of machines and each of those

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,079
machines needs unique g-code generated

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
for it

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,000
so one of the first places that we're

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,519
seeing developers come into the project

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
is they're writing a custom post

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
processor for the machine that they've

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
got

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,880
or for the machine that they sell if

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
it's a company

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,079
and and that's a really easy

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,920
contribution to make but then

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,000
invariably it's like does everything

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,399
except that one thing that we need

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
and then it's a feature and then

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
eventually they start working on the

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,519
core stuff

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
so it's it it's been a lot of fun and

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
it's

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,560
it continues to accelerate and i think

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
we got some fun stuff coming up in the

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
future

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,959
so that's what i've got um we'll do q

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
a

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,360
so these are oh these are a few of the

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
post processors that we have right now

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
from linuxcnc

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,440
smoothie centroid dynapath so quite a

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
few of the most common machines that

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,240
you're going to see

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
in especially in hackerspaces or small

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,839
companies

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,839
we we can generate g-code for right now

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,399
unfolding i mean you model something

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
and you want to make it out of sheet

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,839
metal or

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,040
foam board or something and is it

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,160
possible

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,199
is there anyone working on it to make a

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,480
module that

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,480
unfolds it and

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,560
there is a an add-on workbench that

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
could be

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
uh installed through the add-on manager

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
that's uh

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
called sheet metal and you can both

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
design

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
for sheet metal and take parts that were

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
designed that way and unfold them into a

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
2d

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,800
representation so yes it's it is there i

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:31,839
won't say it works for every model but

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:31,839
it's it's there yeah

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
he asked what libraries were using for

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,120
uh

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,480
tool path generation right now the

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,440
most of the the 2d and 2.5 d operations

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
use a module within free cad called path

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
area

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
that's basically an implementation of

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
the clipper

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
lib the uh by angus johnson it's been

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
around forever

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
uh we also use open cam lib and open

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,760
varoni

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,800
a little bit that are uh for doing

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,800
uh the varoni thing is not merged right

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,320
now that's in one a branch on my repo

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
but we can do like centerline

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,000
engraving of fonts and the

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,199
open cam lib we use for the the like the

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,279
surfacing that you saw

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
in

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
information there so what are the main

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,639
arguments

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,240
for me to use for my colleagues and my

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,959
clients to drop the other thing

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,759
and use free crime can you repeat the

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
question yeah

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,000
so here asking what are the

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,560
the best argument to to switch to

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
freecad as a bim platform i would say

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,000
basically

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,839
the freedom that all other platforms

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
commercial platform would try to lock

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
you in

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,079
uh in a universe where you just use

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
their platform

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,240
and their file formats and you will have

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,480
to use their other solutions

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,240
of their family together and by using a

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,079
free software basically you free

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
yourself from that

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,680
i would say technically you basically

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,320
can do infrequent the same as you can do

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
with

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,320
commercial platform almost like every

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
uh free software you have to search a

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
little bit by yourself

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,759
for some solutions that are not so

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,120
obvious but basically technically it's

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,720
there you can do it

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
and um i would say the

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,279
the best argument is that is the freedom

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,759
and the hackability because frequent is

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,519
totally hackable you do it you do what

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,800
you want with it you reprogram it you

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,120
write macro you can it's might be just

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
five lines of code so it doesn't need to

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
be like

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,079
entering the programming world and you

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,560
already make it do what you want

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,279
and it's extremely easy on freecad and

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
it's

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
really hard on on the platform even with

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,759
tools like

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,199
dynamo etc which are not easy

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:04,480
and so it's basically another word

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,720
another way to to see things

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
yes

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
files and do you have any good

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
recommendations about the workflow you

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,319
use and

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,959
if there are any plans to include inside

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
like you

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,120
yeah so the question is uh um

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,559
what about using git with freecat and

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,840
with architecture

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,000
workflow and uh are there any plans to

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,280
integrate grids better with freecad

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,400
uh say yes we use git a lot and

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,520
um it works and it has those limitations

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
that you say

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,320
um we have already a couple of tools

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,600
uh in freecad to work with git directly

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,400
but um let's say the advantage

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,520
uh of it is basically uh keeping you

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
free to manage it

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,640
outside of record and it's actually uh a

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
good thing

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,320
um that's not tied in freecad and you

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
just manage

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,440
your files the way you want

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,919
without the way frequent developers

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,880
would think you would need to

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,000
so yeah you have a plugin in the add-ons

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
where you can have a

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
git panel in freaking and you can

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
comment from there but

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,400
even me i wrote it and i don't use it

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,240
because it's more convenient to do your

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,280
file management yourself outside of it

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
and on the ifc side i've seen is a

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,760
file format specifically for for

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,679
construction models uh yes we have

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
already begin to have a couple of diff

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,080
tools and tools that

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,160
allow you to to see a difference with

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,840
between one version and another version

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,200
of the file there is one in the beamwork

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,160
bench in freecad

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,080
uh there is one being developed for uh

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,200
for blender as well blender

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
begin to have a good ifc uh interface

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,480
and so you begin to have in the world

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
open source world things that are

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,559
bettering in that

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,600
in that regard and so yeah

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,520
i believe pretty soon we'll be able to

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,280
use ifc files

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,840
the right way let's say the open sway

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
with all the features

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,480
yeah yeah so you haven't had a question

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,080
yet go ahead

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,400
okay uh yeah so it's a question

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,400
um about the cam

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
something that tells me that during this

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,840
step of the assembly

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
that part is going to interfere

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,840
well the assembly workbench the question

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
has to do with

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,799
the need for detecting if i

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
correct me if i paraphrase wrong

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,960
detecting collisions

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
uh or interferences between parts uh

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,280
within assemblies

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:33,919
can you explain a little bit more how

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:37,120
you see the overlap to the camera

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,799
with a part okay so how does a tool

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,400
interfere with a part

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,000
for the the 2.5 d the the easier

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,240
uh kinds of tool paths that we've

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
generated prior

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,400
it's very simple offsetting so there's

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,280
no detection of whether or not the part

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
is colliding with the model it's simply

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
offsetting

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
uh a the radius of a tool away from the

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,080
the lines in or out

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,400
um the the open cam lib

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,799
the for the surfacing part what it does

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,960
is it takes the actual shape of a tool

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,400
and pushes it against the shape of the

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
the model until

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,600
there's an overlap between them and

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,360
that's the control point

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,120
for that step in the tool path so

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,919
i don't see a a direct way to generalize

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,320
that from

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,280
cam into into assemblies

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,400
beyond that the assembly part of free

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
cat is

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
is under heavy development right now in

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,400
fact it's more a combination

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,400
of add-on workbenches

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,840
and i'm not qualified to say but yeah

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,840
that's about where that's at

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,360
so the question is about uh alternative

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,240
discussion forum

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,600
for development of free cad is that

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
correct

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,240
so right now everything is done through

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,600
a phpb um

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,080
forum uh which has an enormous amount of

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,400
activity to the point that it's become

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
almost unwieldy it's it's difficult or

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,320
impossible to keep up

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,400
the the development is broken down into

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,640
channels so there's a dedicated

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
path cam channel where most of the

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
discussion about the the cam stuff

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
happens

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,640
and the same thing for arch and the

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,000
other workbenches but a lot of the

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,840
functionality

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or the development needs span multiple

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,200
workbenches

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,600
so i would say yeah it's it's

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
talked about but i don't think we have a

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,919
good answer for

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,000
what what a replacement would look like

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,120
or how to migrate to it

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,720
if you've got ideas about how how we can

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:23,840
improve that or specific thing

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:23,840
specific problems to address you know

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,440
the question is about uh energy

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,279
efficiency modeling in

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,159
infrequent uh basically yeah you can

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,720
do it basically what works at the moment

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,480
is

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,440
uh producing um

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,720
ifc models from freecad and exporting to

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,279
a

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
software that accepts uh ifc formats

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,880
such as

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,600
openstudio and then they're converted

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,530
into an

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,720
energy model the problem is that

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,440
[Music]

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,679
for energy analysis software you need a

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,320
very very specific

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,600
simplified model which is basically each

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,640
room like this one

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,360
is a box and each face of the box has

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,360
properties

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,279
of how it lets uh heat go to go through

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,559
and it's a very simple model very

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,760
different than what you

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,200
use to to make the building uh where you

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,480
really want to to model

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,039
the the walls and everything um

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,919
so at the moment it's a bit tricky and

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
we cannot

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,480
directly from freecad outputs a model

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
that's ready for energy analysis

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
but that's something i would like to

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,159
have

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,600
to make and we must think a little bit

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,279
better how to do that

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,679
um how to let's say model the

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,880
traditional way with walls that have

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,919
thickness and everything

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
and from that extract and analyze this

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,799
model

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
and it's doable we will have a couple of

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,200
ideas but

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,360
no no real plan practical plan

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
on how to do that yet but yeah that's

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,840
definitely on the

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,840
on the list

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,720
i can manage because i'm working with

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
felix which is a

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,559
package library for python to do as

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,200
computational free dynamics

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,000
but i am very involved with generating

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,640
solids

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,640
or generating some features in other

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,799
so the question is uh what programming

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,880
languages does fricate use

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,159
basically the core is all programmed in

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
c plus plus

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,600
and all the functionality on top of it

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
is

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,320
mostly python uh basically the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,240
the the c plus plus and python interface

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,720
are very similar

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
so we used to say basically you can work

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
in freecads

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,960
either in python or c plus plus and it's

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,919
more a matter of your

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,720
own choice than another than a technical

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,279
matter

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,720
and because you can basically do the

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
same in both

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,679
languages you can program a workbench

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,279
fully in python fully in c plus plus or

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,840
a mix of both uh it depends mostly on on

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,039
your

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,600
preferences and most

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
libraries that we use inside the project

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,240
have both

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,880
c plus plus and python uh interface

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,600
uh so for example the qt for the the

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,159
interface

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
you can access it from both languages

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,760
and the same goes for every lib

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,360
library that we use inside freecad um

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,120
so it's really really convenient to use

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,200
any of those two languages

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,960
and basically that are the two that are

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
used in

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,640
what are the in frequent outputs the

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,279
extensions that you

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,279
are creating

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,760
so the question is what

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,310
geometry formats are the most common to

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
commonly used in freecads

00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,080
[Music]

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,360
i would say step is the most common one

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,399
step is a solid-based format step format

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,840
has like

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,520
the solids are defined by their faces

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,480
and those faces can be nerves

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,760
that can be like defined by geometrical

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,640
curves

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,360
so basically you can just represent

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,799
about anything with that

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,240
and it's a very very solid file format

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,360
that's there since ever

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
and all the engineering work world still

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,880
uses

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
uses it uh so i would say that the best

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,360
formats to work with in infrequent

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,559
stl is used a lot for 3d printing but

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,799
stl inside an scl file you don't

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,159
only have points and triangles so your

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,440
curves will get

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,480
faceted turned into small facets

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,000
and so you can output things easily from

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
freecad to stl but it's

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,399
really hard to get back uh an stl into

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
freecad and

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,880
you won't have the curves anymore um so

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
that's a good output format and it's not

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
a good

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,960
input format step is good for input and

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,919
output so it's

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,399
basically what most people use freecad

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,840
can

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:41,039
import and freecad can import and export

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,240
uh just about any solid model format

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,320
brap iges dxf etc

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,320
maybe one more one more question

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,520
um just related to a modeling part i've

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,600
noticed now integration of several

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,960
finite element modeling tools in

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,200
freetown can you

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,159
uh just outline the road map about

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
integrating i

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,000
at the moment i find it very difficult

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
to follow the evolution and get started

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
with

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:12,480
entertainment modeling so is there

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:14,559
anything on integrating

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,559
