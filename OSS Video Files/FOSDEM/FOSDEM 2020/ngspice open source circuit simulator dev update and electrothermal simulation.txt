An update of the development activities will be presented leading to ngspice-32. Its interface to KiCad has been extended, PSPICE device model compatibility and OpAmp convergence are improved, several bugs have been fixed.


The VBIC bipolar model and the VDMOS power MOS model now incorporate the self heating effect.


This will lead to the second part of the talk: ngspice may be very well used to simulate thermal device behavior. Heat generation, transport and temperatures are translated into electrical signals. Thus we simulate two circuits: The electrical circuit with its power losses, and the thermal circuit withany resulting device heating, its feedback on the electrical behavior, and the external cooling measures that need to be provided. Some ciruit examples will be given.

ladies and gentlemen I wanted to give

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,600
you a short update on the ngspice

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,110
development and have some application

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,280
which I was dealing in the recent past

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,380
is electro thermal simulation well my

00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,960
name is Goga folk i'm from university of

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,640
Duisburg essen in Duisburg in germany

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,039
and i'm also be the Fraunhofer Institute

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,600
and micro electronic circuits and

00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:38,879
systems ok yeah just to wrap up ngspice

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,749
what is it it's a circuit simulator

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,210
it shows the equations of electronic

00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:46,890
circuits and these electronic circuits

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,850
may be made of passive and active

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,940
devices and we want to solve the

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,359
equations for time varying currents and

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,550
voltages and it's well its name says it

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,420
it's the open source successor of the

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,820
venerable spice 3 from Berkeley well

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,520
what do we have in fact we have a

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,790
circuit on the far left simple circuit

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,890
here in CMOS inverter but this is not

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,820
the input spice typically has because

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,430
it's a command-line input and we use of

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,880
this thing in the middle just a list a

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,270
netlist which gives us the devices and

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,240
the connections and some simulation

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,610
commands and the output is on the right

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,520
this is a graphical output of for

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,310
example where voltages versus time you

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,230
see some punch pulse waveforms input an

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:47,250
output of an inverter okay so ngspice

00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:52,050
has two major application areas it's the

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,360
one is a PCB design support well

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,540
typically here circuits are made of a

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,700
mix of ICS and discrete components and

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,390
there you have a requirement well you

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,390
have a comfortable user interface okay

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,149
you have seen ngspice is a command line

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,950
so this is not that comfortable so we

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:17,340
rely on others we rely on kicad and we

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,910
rely on some other parties to offer for

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,750
example schematic capture

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,560
and when we do these circuit simulations

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,630
we have to be compatible to some

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,120
well-known software tools like peace

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,700
bias and ltspice this is mostly

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,910
concerning the device models we are

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:41,280
using on the other hand we have the

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:45,120
capability of doing IC design support

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,730
mostly today ICS are made of MOS devices

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,040
and you have many of them and you would

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,360
have some parasitic devices as well of

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,830
course resistors and capacitors that are

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,800
included in your circuit there we need

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,150
compatibility to existing device models

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,630
Berkeley models Museum three and four

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,190
and maybe bit in bulk and others and we

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,290
have to have large circuit capability

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,750
few thousands or even ten thousands of

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,910
transistors therefore we need a certain

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,460
simulation speed and we should be

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,560
compatible to some process development

00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,910
kits that are offered by the foundry so

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,090
you get their device models from the

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,190
foundry and typical stuff very used

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,220
there is a CH spice so we try to be H

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,190
spice ptk compatible and then write it

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:37,500
down you see some software using ngspice

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,510
and supporting ng spice both on the PCB

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:45,340
design support side and also on the IC

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,740
design support side okay so what is the

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,430
status or what we are doing right now so

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,390
we are working towards ng spice 32

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,010
should be available hopefully in march

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,990
well as you see from the things we are

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,060
doing there there is no revolution going

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,950
on it's a lot of evolutionary

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:09,730
development moving on improved graphics

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:14,680
for the output both on Windows and both

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:19,690
and there on Linux we want to add

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,940
Unicode support let me use utf-8 strings

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,760
and white shark strings on windows and

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:30,030
that we can use Korean and Chinese and

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,340
Russian and other language

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,520
languages or text for plots node names

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,610
file names directory names and we have a

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,810
compared to the last ngspice issue a

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,060
revised model for power most devices an

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,370
efficient model this is this VD mas

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,770
model and this now includes self-heating

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,199
and I will talk about that in a minute

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:59,849
well in addition of course we have a lot

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:02,620
of enhancement of robustness bug fixes

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,620
improved error handling so if there is

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,949
an error get better error messages major

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,909
code cleanup is in fact going on and

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:16,060
therefore the ABI into connection to the

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:18,940
users may be on the kick outside may be

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,759
direct users and ngspice are important

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,130
to react and we are relatively fast

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:30,099
sometimes bugs are fixed within one day

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:33,820
if it's required ok some just some

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:37,659
impressions well what how to input

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:43,020
things into ngspice now for example we

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:45,460
we ArchiCAD well the power amplifier

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,130
schematic here and you can directly get

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,509
the netlist out of key cut into ngspice

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,690
and either use the in the internal kick

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:58,539
at ngspice version or can you can upload

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,229
it to external kicad well i'm concerning

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:06,310
i see work there is a relatively new

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:09,190
thing called X cam and integration work

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,800
is going on they are also for IC work

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,599
well and the output is lots of different

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,599
graphs it's gnuplot

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,000
output it's the internal ngspice

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,880
plotting capability we can write per

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,020
script files and we can of course use it

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:31,990
the kicad integrated output ok so i have

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,199
been saying that i want to go a little

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,320
bit into one special application area

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,210
this is electro thermal simulation

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,370
starting well with a if you are familiar

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,840
with MOS devices you see this out

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:50,930
characteristics of an MOS device x-axis

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,570
is drain voltage y-axis is the current

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,120
and what is happening well you increase

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:59,150
the drain voltage and the current is

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,160
decreasing somehow so this is strange

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,530
yeah do we have negative resistance in

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,880
our MOS device no it's a very simple

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,139
thing this device heats up and because

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,330
we have of course we have some power

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,000
dissipation you see 10 volts and 2 amps

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,490
20 watt power dissipation and device the

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,490
device heats up and so the electrical

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,620
characteristics of this device is

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,870
changing especially here the mobility of

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,120
the charge carriers is decreasing and so

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,990
the current decreases with increasing

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:35,780
temperature simply and the temperature

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:39,289
increases because the power dissipated

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,360
power by increase yeah and so how can we

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,300
do this how can we model this and this

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,030
is the idea we want to we have

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,740
integrated recently into our devices

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:55,700
yeah now the gate wattage is step sizes

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,160
okay so yeah the question was do I keep

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,470
the gate voltage constant now I don't

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,750
this is stepwise increasing the gate

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,840
voltage here yeah so the lowest graph is

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:11,389
the lowest gate voltage change it's just

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:13,430
raising up yeah so this is about electro

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,950
thermal modeling and what is it yeah we

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,080
make use of the equivalence of thermal

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,099
circuits and electronic circuits

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,889
yeah you'll be translated thermals into

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:29,539
electrical circuits and then we run both

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:32,330
circuit parts in ngspice so electrical

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:36,080
power dissipation generates heat heat

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,110
has some restricted flow path and so it

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,870
rises the temperature of the device

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,969
temperature changes some device

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,830
characteristics and so we have this

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,480
closed loop this has to be integrated

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:53,600
and well deserves special device models

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,870
that can react to this and in the table

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,990
you see ok the equivalence of electric

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,890
and solvent or terms like the heat

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:06,260
capacitance the capability of a material

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,470
to store heat similar as electric

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,290
capacity electrical capacitance or we

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,230
have the conductance thermal conductance

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:18,220
the heat flow is restricted somehow it's

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,230
the same or equivalent as resistor

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:26,390
before the electrical current yeah and

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:29,300
so because we can't do electronic and

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,860
thermal circuits at the same time well

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,200
we can you simulate them at the same

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,820
time here you see just another power

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:42,110
amplifier made in kicad a schema for

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,029
generating the ngspice netlist and you

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,700
see the MOS devices and these MOS

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:51,950
devices the power devices on the right

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,640
well here they are a little bit special

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:58,460
because they don't have only three pins

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,740
but they have five pins and with they

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,020
have three electrical and to thermal

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,970
pins Thermal pin is the junction

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,730
temperature and is the outer case

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,620
temperature yeah so this is the

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,250
interconnection between the electronic

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:16,339
and the thermal circuitry and on the

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,700
right you see well this is our thermal

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,010
circuit and in fact this is a heat

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,250
electrical equivalent of a heat sink you

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:29,450
have a small resistor coming in here

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:33,589
this is how the transistor is put onto

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,690
the heatsink with some some glue or

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,580
whatever that is certain thermal

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,130
resistance then we have a capacitor

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,050
because of the mass of the heatsink that

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,580
has a Surma

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,450
thermal capacitance and you have a

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,250
resistor the thermal resistance of this

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,709
heatsink and then we have a voltage

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,420
source this is the outside temperature

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:58,570
42 degrees here and then you can do this

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,480
simulation because it's now all

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:06,079
electrical devices and of course ngspice

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,870
can do this and in complete single

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,460
fashion well on the Left you don't see

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,230
much about these temperatures

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,780
just the input voltage and the output

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,570
voltage so the amplifiers amplifying

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,360
this is great and on the right is

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,780
assimilation for about 10 seconds 10

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,120
seconds on the x-axis and the output

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,670
well here is its name voltage but in

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,230
fact it's the temperature you see here

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:35,690
you just see the temperature of this

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,970
transistor on it's heat sink is rising

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,160
well and we have the outside case

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,260
temperature here and we have the

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,930
junction temperature here and typically

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:52,430
Junction temperature is specified in the

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:54,920
specification sheet 2 we not beyond a

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,120
certain maximum and this can be

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,010
simulated here easily now with the Co

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,480
simulation of electrical and thermal

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:07,700
circuits okay and you can do other thing

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,850
this is a resistor a simple resistor

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,170
with has a negative temperature

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,610
coefficient that means the temperature

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,340
rises so if the resistance decreases and

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,920
we put a voltage on and we simulate

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,330
versus time and we see where the

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,450
temperature is rising and rising and

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,860
rising and a certain point the thing

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,280
breaks down the temperature goes up

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,100
beyond all bounds and this is simply a

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,240
thermal runaway yeah and so you can

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,360
simulate the limits of your system

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,090
system capability before it starts to

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:50,000
explode let's say okay so to summarize

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:53,510
well ngspice hopefully will be available

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,490
in march this year with several new

00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:00,590
features many many bug fixes Unicode

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,990
compatibility enhanced Monte Carlo

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,150
simulation capability I didn't talk

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,220
about this here today but this is

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,100
another thing of interest especially for

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,490
the IC designers and we have these

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,610
electro thermal models of power devices

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,440
integrated and even then well we just

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,950
think about what will we do next for

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:30,219
ngspice 33 thank you

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:30,219
[Applause]

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:46,490
yes this is the question is where do I

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:50,330
get the modeling data because the models

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,930
are s as good as well the day in potater

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:57,110
are yes one has to look a little bit

00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:01,040
into detail so for the transistor itself

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,050
it's just a so-so judgment how much

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,970
copper is in how much plastic is in and

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,710
then you have weight and then you have

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,540
it from a capacity of the material and

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,000
then you can calculate the thermal

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,130
capacitance for heatsink while the

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:42,830
heating heatsink manufacturers you

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:45,740
deliver these things to you know yeah

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,080
the question was is there in the native

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,300
way of doing some electro thermal

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,910
simulation he can especially because on

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:57,860
the graph it was voltage and in fact it

00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:00,200
was temperature not yet the it's just a

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,660
matter of this interface between a key

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,600
card and ngspice so ngspice affect us

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,370
calculate voltages and then you can tell

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,960
of course the graph the output graph

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,870
it's not a voltage it's a temperature

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,570
because the equivalence is clear and the

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,510
the equations the relationship between

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,150
these two is clear and so ngspice

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,270
calculates voltage but in fact it's the

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:26,570
temperature and the graph should show

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,580
temperature yes in with in in ngspice

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,960
directly you can just tell it this is

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,960
not a voltage this is the temperature

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:59,560
the question is can one take cadence

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,060
simulation environment at the data and

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,290
put them into ngspice into simulation

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:12,029
yes there has been some guide doing a

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:15,940
translator that uses it takes the

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:17,860
cadence spectra input thing and

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,709
translate it into the ngspice netlist

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:25,360
and the models of course you have to

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:27,430
select ngspice at a certain number of

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,560
models available and if these are the

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,250
same as cadence and well be some three

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,720
for older processes beaten for for newer

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,720
processes then you can do that

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,220
[Music]

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:11,760
or the commission was a compatibility

00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:14,909
between ltspice and ngspice and

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,490
especially polynomial functions well

00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:20,429
there is a polynomial function

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:23,610
capability in ngspice as has been in the

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:28,350
old spice - it's the same same feature

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:30,539
same function this is working well if

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,870
you say if it's fully compatible well we

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,909
are never fully compatible main reason

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,220
is we don't know what ltspice has in

00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:41,250
yeah so we don't know the equations of

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,350
ltspice so we can just figure out should

00:17:41,250 --> 00:18:00,690
be similar and this is what we are doing

00:17:43,350 --> 00:18:02,700
and this is continuously improving the

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:09,019
question is what is the licensing

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:14,059
situation of the models good question

00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:17,870
well the model development is mostly

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,980
nowadays done proprietary these

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:23,000
companies pay for these model

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,159
development and the models are

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,299
publicized some with some delay maybe

00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,669
year or two also on the open world and

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,639
there is I think model developers her

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:39,360
and their parent the companies have

00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:42,659
agreed upon a so called I don't know the

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,299
abbreviation educational license to and

00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:50,760
now they offer these models under this

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:55,950
specific license this is a sort of open

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,360
source license I just have to clarify if

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,840
it is Debbie I'm compatible because

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,399
these are the very strict people will do

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,409
that and if this is difficult well then

00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:10,309
we have two distribution channels we

00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:14,279
have ngspice and we have another

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,379
download for if especially for Debian

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,940
people and we have another download on

00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:20,510
the more

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,630
and you can link it together so both are

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,510
open-source but maybe not the ultimate

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:30,430
most newest model is available right now

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,430
it's taken a year or two

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:40,839
