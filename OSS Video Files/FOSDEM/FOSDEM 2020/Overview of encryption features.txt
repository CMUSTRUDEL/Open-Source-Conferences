MariaDB/MySQL/Percona Server provide some features in this space, but currently there isn't one product that covers all the needs (at least not available as FOSS).
This talk will provide an overview of Data-at-Rest-Encryption features in MySQL, MariaDB and Percona Server for MySQL, their availability across versions, and status (experimental/GA).

	00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,070
so hi hi everyone sir my name is Hawaii

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,110
and I'll be talking to you about the

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,870
beta at rest encryption how is it

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:24,150
implemented in Moorea DB SQL and the

00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:27,390
pre-cana server so we cover you so main

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,010
goal of this talk is deployed like know

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,680
all the features that you can get

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,570
encrypted like first why do I use it

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,489
well let's get with what's getting

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,760
written to disk what's getting and not

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:45,570
getting it encrypted a bit about key

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:48,179
management and how to do backup so so

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,839
what do we mean when we say data at rest

00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,480
data at rest in information technology

00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:57,719
means inactive data that is stored

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,600
physically in any digital form so it's

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,220
like databases spreadsheets of set

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,420
backups so most of the data that's

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,399
collected is being collected because it

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,070
has some value so even if you're just

00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:16,850
holding the data it has like some sound

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,149
centric sentimental value I guess so

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,310
so bitter at rest encryption or the

00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,090
other term is the type seen is like our

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,479
transport

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,630
data encryption it provides like a layer

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,560
of security for the files that are

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:39,869
stored on the on the disk this means

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,960
like if your data gets stolen or someone

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,109
that gets like access to your server

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,450
even if he they copied the data they

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,840
still can't continues it without the

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,530
without the encryption so you know that

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,350
or like maybe you have a like you know

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,659
what you don't want to like the several

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,759
operators if you are like a hosting

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,479
somewhere you don't you don't want them

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,190
to get the access to the data so so this

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:17,190
is like getting more popular with the

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:18,120
gdpr and even like in the past what in

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,489
the last few years

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,069
you've seen like lots of data leaks from

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:27,980
the from the databases so what do you

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,650
think what's getting written to disk so

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,310
simply will space the most for me my

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,069
file is IB data one so it contains

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,610
double write write buffer change buffer

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:46,739
and beta dictionary so undo tablespace

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:50,370
or most famous files are undo 0 0 1 and

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:56,430
undo the 0 0 2 and you can have like

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:59,819
your own like user edit tablespaces file

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:06,420
tablespace this is if you're using like

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,930
MVP file file per table option we don't

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,860
work

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,180
I don't file 0 so then you know type of

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,910
species and the temporary tablespaces so

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,640
other work files these are like analog

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:26,850
or general work old block if you have

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,410
the whole clock plugin so what's getting

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,510
written to disk but it's nothing to be

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,739
encrypted country data at rest

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,900
encryption only covers in ODB so other

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,769
storage engines are not supported like

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,549
my rocks toku DB myosin slow query log

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:47,450
general oak log are not also being

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:51,470
encrypted all that work is not encrypted

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:55,530
but as always we have like exceptions so

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,840
Aria storage engine is in Margarette Eby

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,329
using my Mario DB is getting encrypted

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,870
it can be equipped 'add but only the

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:08,459
storage engine another area logs so all

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,970
the clock so internal server and varga

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,090
DB or block plugin is like a community

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,720
based it's like free to use but it's not

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,330
there is no option to that you can work

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:28,800
in encrypted but in muscular 8 oÃ­clock

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,169
plugin is enterprise feature and they

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,009
all

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:38,740
to have like an option to encrypt it sir

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,279
so key management so in order to enable

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:46,029
the the encryption we need to configure

00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:49,139
the server to user some of the key

00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:52,779
management buttons so these plugins are

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:56,889
responsible for both the management of

00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:58,990
the encryption and and for the

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,639
management of the encryption keys and

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:06,370
the actual equip ssin and the commission

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:10,240
of the data so there's like a one one

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:13,210
one important thing is like all of them

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,629
like support multiple or caring plugins

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:21,729
but only one curing plugin should be

00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:23,949
enabled at it at a time so enabling like

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,499
multiple key components is like not

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,050
supported and it can result in the data

00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:31,599
loss so and like the the real thing is

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,779
like the server one if you like enable

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:43,270
multiple several one won't complain sir

00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:48,250
during buggies in Moorea DB we have like

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:51,189
three five key management it's like it's

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,529
like a base key management plug-in it

00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:55,779
reads the key from the plain text file

00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:58,539
so and MariaDB

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:01,029
also offers like they have like a nice

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,449
tutorial on how to encrypt this encrypt

00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:11,110
this file so it's not it's not readable

00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:13,779
by users so AWS key management so you

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,499
can use this with the AWS or team

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:19,830
management service so the very key

00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:22,990
management so I got this from the

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,689
documentation my DB documentation but

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,740
when I get to the links of the aperi are

00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:33,180
it shows like 404 so I'm not sure if

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,180
it's like supported or not

00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,270
the concealer also provides getting file

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:45,159
plug-in service like a plain text file

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:47,349
but currently it doesn't work or if you

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:51,369
encrypt it so it's not it's only like a

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:55,960
plain text file so because they're all

00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:58,990
surprised the hash code or killing volt

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:04,229
plug-in so if you use like crash course

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,229
Walt you can store the keys there so

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,249
yeah so my skill also provides the king

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:14,139
file plugin but they have like few more

00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:20,559
I think like five or six but these are

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:22,869
only available as Enterprise so so what

00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,199
so when you're encrypting the production

00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:26,349
data

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:31,149
you need to make sure that you don't

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:33,550
lose the key so if the key is lost you

00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:38,349
get used all the access to the files so

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,629
not good but also I've seen this you

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,930
know in a few cases people backup the

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:46,449
key video data so it's like you know

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,659
walking your house but leaving the key

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:54,399
in the in the door or so that's nothing

00:07:49,659 --> 00:08:00,729
not a good idea is also so on the stop

00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:04,899
that's encrypted in my ODB system

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:07,089
tablespace encryption so it solves the

00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,930
double double double right buffer and

00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:14,830
the change buffer if you have like one

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,539
of my data files but the the most

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,149
popular on aziz i be data so is it a

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:27,369
group encrypted the maria TBC's since

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:30,849
then 10.1 so it was g8 in october 2015

00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:33,399
so it's like like two four and a half

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:36,909
years so it's also available in

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,630
infrequent server five seven currently

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,729
in experimental so this is the you know

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,079
DBC stable space and get variable can be

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,240
used to encrypt it so no also available

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:52,770
in

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,500
precursor 8 or 13 but not available in

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,839
Italy in my skelita

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,250
so there's like importantly limitation

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,899
with this so you can use this only when

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,630
you are like initializing the database

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,130
so it's like you cannot convert the

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,649
system tablespace from the encrypted

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,209
feet to the unencrypted running

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,020
unencrypted or vice-versa

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,279
so if conversion isn't like immediate

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,800
you create a new instance really

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,380
initialize or you set up the in ODB

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,910
tables tablespace encrypt in your

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,410
comfort file and then use like to start

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,290
the service and then you move your data

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,020
to the to that instance

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:38,300
so my scale system tablespace encryption

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:41,250
so this is like this like a Ito specific

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:45,020
inator mice in my scary toe and

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:48,570
precursor eater this system tablespace

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,480
MySQL system tablespace contains the

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,410
MySQL system database and data

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,640
dictionary files so so yeah to enable it

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:04,950
you can just do all the tablespace and

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:07,470
set the database and 33s so this is like

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:12,060
not available in the Morea DB because

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,740
maria DB is like doesn't help doesn't

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,500
doesn't separate the MySQL system

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,399
tablespace from the system tablespace so

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,300
under the on the tablespace encryption

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,360
so these are like most people files are

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,149
undo 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 from the also

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,730
available in my ad BC what most of these

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,020
features are quite available in my DB

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,170
for like four years

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:40,740
so in precursor or

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:44,870
country experimental you can use this

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:49,500
variable to do it but g8 in my scale 8

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:53,130
and J reading into concert so that's a

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,850
limitation when you use this so then

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,579
it's like once you enable it you can't

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,070
actually disable it so I mean you're

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:05,770
like you always need

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,280
killing file to be getting plugin to be

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:13,840
loaded

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:15,310
because what but once it's turned on the

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,880
server can't guarantee that there are

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:23,080
don't any PVC or record in the in the

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,580
undo tablespace so like this is not

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:31,390
something we want to test on your like

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:36,160
production file tablespace this is one

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,840
like one of the earliest features

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,770
available so it's available in five

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:46,230
seven eleven my scale and same in

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:51,730
perkiness era we got it by the optimizer

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:54,760
how to use it so little log encryption

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,900
so like if you like encrypting the

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:02,140
InnoDB tables and don't have like

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,860
encrypted we don't walk so later written

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:10,230
to the encrypting encrypted or people

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,230
still may be found in the reader log so

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,990
[Music]

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,560
so yeah

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:30,089
general tablespace are also available

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:33,769
things in like this is like g8 mostly it

00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:37,620
feature as well so you can use it by

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:42,470
creating the tablespace something at

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,470
just you know the encryption optional

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:49,050
temporary tablespace encryption so this

00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:52,519
one is like fun so available all seen

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:56,339
running a DB a vulgar release to option

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,430
in precursor five seven it's still

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,059
experimental these are the purpose of

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:06,029
the canoes I mean a tow available in

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:09,809
it's like g8 in Perkins server but this

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:16,139
is still not available in the in the in

00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:18,269
the MySQL so these are like what was

00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:23,309
getting a cryptic here so it's like it's

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:25,350
like the IB temp file this is the power

00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:31,139
that get created on the on the server

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:33,629
starts and the temp files what's covered

00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,029
it's like five sort or that's like for

00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,290
example when you want to select which is

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,509
saved and like those guys like SQL

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,139
bigger result and written hints all

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:46,559
right and like binary log term sanction

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:53,100
transaction caches and duplication cache

00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:58,350
so applications money all contain the

00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:04,529
duty information right that's used to

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:07,319
copy data between the service so in

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,389
other words so like if you get if you

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,970
get everything and keep it but you don't

00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,620
encrypt it belong you know someone you

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,519
can still see all of your all of your

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:21,480
data so but yeah sucks so one thing is

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,240
like this is only like the mug is being

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,529
encrypted on the disk so you still need

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,899
to do do like TOS if set up the TOS for

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,679
the application together they tank a bit

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,679
across the networks

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:46,000
yeah so envious so we knew yeah one of

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,580
the things if you do the you can encrypt

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,240
this like this this feature encrypts

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,180
both of the binary and the relay logs so

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,940
if you if you set the feature on and

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,270
even if you don't have the binary works

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:07,390
on by default in write it logs you'll

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:10,390
still get encrypted so so once you get

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:14,230
those encrypted are the ponies like like

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:17,800
not what mutation is that my scale blog

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,680
cannot readin directly so but you can

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,690
use them you know if you can read them

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,840
by setting up the lead from remote

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:30,130
server options so what this option like

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:35,160
requires the server to be running so in

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:37,780
five seven and Maria my DB then if you

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,710
encrypt the bin lock it requires the

00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:45,010
sort to be restarted for changes to take

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:47,470
effect take effect in a toe or in both

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,600
mice mice mice kill and reconcile

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,330
implementation once you set the bonaga

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:59,790
encryption server automatically rotates

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,790
the log and the new logs get encrypted

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,210
backups you can backup the encrypted

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,030
data

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,150
let's talk to you good feature so you

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:14,380
can use pic kinetic step back up to back

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:18,610
up the my scale and kind of server my

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:23,020
get Maria back up for breaking up the

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:26,770
ADB stuff and you can use MySQL dump to

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,180
make up for all three of them so the

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,790
thing is like with my scale dump if you

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:36,490
do the backup it won't be encrypted by

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:39,430
default so how does this look like so

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,060
encrypt all things in my DB so features

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,930
this like the nice one so how to set up

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,980
the

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:54,370
how to encrypt the file key management

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:57,160
and it's like in concern it's like this

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,450
is this is the example with a hush-hush

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,980
called Walt

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:12,579
so you know secret all the features in

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:16,410
my is Kuwait I use the game file so this

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:19,740
is what but but getting encrypted or not

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,740
all of them

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,839
the my ADB team takes the credit for

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,270
leading the way with the data at rest

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,820
encryption most of the most of their

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,970
features have been here since 10.1

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,100
release and that's like I said like

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,840
that's like four and a half years

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,940
probably more so other things that's

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,130
important is like all these features are

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,830
disabled by default so you have to set

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:53,320
up the killing file drink plugin and

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:55,300
enable each each of these also like each

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,220
of these have to have like a special

00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:03,160
option that you can that you need to set

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,110
so it get so they get encrypted so come

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,660
to it there's like there's no like

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,950
master switch to in it you say

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,390
encryption on and everything gets

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:19,020
encrypted that's still nothing so in the

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:23,590
period of what car year you know half so

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:25,630
this this table out complete completely

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:32,860
different except the other MariaDB

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:34,990
things with ps2 console five seven sound

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:39,520
the feature features were available but

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:43,090
were only experimental and from MySQL it

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,240
had only five per table five file per

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,050
table tablespace encryption and we do on

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,050
the log encryption

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,310
[Music]

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,130
so like if you want to know how the

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:04,500
sausage is made there is like a talk

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,970
from my colleague robot in the u8 room

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,280
you don't have like a more detail to

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,290
talk about implementation of this of

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,760
this feature in the MySQL and perkiness

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,970
era this is like more internal fermented

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,010
talk so even if you don't want to attend

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,230
the talk you can watch the recording if

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:30,750
you're interested in this these are the

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:42,400
resources and thank you this is me

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:45,970
questions yeah so regarding the

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,120
performance I haven't done any

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,800
benchmarks but from the like money I've

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,700
seen from the my adb documentation they

00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:08,940
say like 3 to 5% and I've seen someone

00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:12,220
like Ron six okay oh yeah

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,280
yeah you can you can I didn't tell this

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:21,310
because you can like rotate the keys so

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:23,580
those like us supporting depends on the

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,580
implementation

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:40,060
yeah I mean sorry yeah so the thing is

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,530
like it depends on the on the recurring

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,530
plugin if you are using sir

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:15,100
any more questions so yeah so the

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,230
question was how does this complain

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,010
compare with the file system encryption

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:25,000
so you can do that but this is like more

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:30,140
granular anymore so you still have the

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,630
encryption this like makes sense if you

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,400
like your if you're like in the hosting

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,980
environment so you have like someone

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,620
that it needs to get the access to the

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,740
data the the other data that's not the

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:47,870
my scale like my scale data so that's

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:49,340
the separation sir so you can get you

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,080
know you can manage all the stuff but

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,080
again you can't see the the data

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,289
