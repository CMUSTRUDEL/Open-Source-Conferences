Sharing knowledge in a team of people working together (company, association, study group or any other kind of project) is key for its long-term success. Even if this is not properly identified from the beginning as a main concern, setting up tools and processes that allow knowledge to be accumulated and organized correctly ends up being on the TODO list at some point, and may come with the wish to have done it earlier. Thus, the best solution is one that is quick enough to setup from the very beginning and versatile enough to be able to incrementally develop into a proper solid fortress of knowledge.
In this presentation I will use the XWiki platform to incrementally build a collaborative intranet from scratch and will try to address some frequent needs of knowledge sharing in a team, using already-made add-ons or new tools (list not exhaustive):
* Blog, for unidirectional communication,
* Meeting notes, for spoken knowledge not to be lost,
* File Manager for just dropping files to share,
* Task manager for lightweight ticketing,
* Holiday requests and Recruitment applications for team management,
* Unstructured free content sharing, using standard wiki pages and page templates,
* Structured content tailored to fit your exact specific needs,
* Multi-wiki separation for teams isolation,
* Powerful search in all this,
* Authentication add-ons to plug your own users management,
* Easy look &amp; feel setup, to brand it as your own.

okay hello everybody I'm I'm uncle Lucas

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,870
romick's Wicky

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,840
and I would like to talk to you about

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,250
Vicky so I'm gonna talk to you about ex

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,380
vici now

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,780
this talk is called from zero to

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,540
Internet in the 20 minutes the zero is

00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,330
that I don't even have slides it's going

00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,759
to be demo based if we can all join

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,730
hands to summon the energy of the gods

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,039
to make this not fail it would be

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,249
amazing

00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,460
so what I wanted to show you is maybe

00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:45,809
just a few words about myself I'm an

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,809
engineer I think that's how I call my

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,260
job and today I'm solutions architect at

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,039
a company that does produces open source

00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:03,030
code and provide services for this open

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:05,909
source code which is excuse ice so what

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,070
I wanted to do was to build a cheap

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,579
intranet out of an open source platform

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,979
which is acquittee and I want you to

00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,799
imagine that we have a company like a

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,210
small medium sized no small it would be

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
small because it would be around maybe

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,780
40 or 50 people just enough to want to

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,229
go out of world documents in terms of

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,079
knowledge sharing and not not enough in

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,299
order to not enough to go to a like a

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,950
fully fledged solution with lots of

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,310
bells and whistles and really really

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,549
expensive so what I want to to take as a

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,869
use case is the use case of a group of

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:50,700
people producing Jam like Jam to spread

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,770
on bread in the morning and I imagine

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,600
that we'd have these people that have

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,549
the knowledge about their job and have

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,679
all sorts of work that they need to do

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,689
together and they need to not lose the

00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:03,119
knowledge of what they are doing they

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,740
want to share stuff about their job so

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm going to transform its wiki in an

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,979
intranet in 20 minutes

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,379
go first we go on the Wigg xwiki website

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,720
we click download and then we can

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,950
download here the expression I'm not

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,590
going to do it now it's about 300 mega

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,420
is gonna be too long but I already have

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,420
done that on my local instance and I

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:30,430
have a virgin ex wiki here this is what

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,550
happens when you first start it quickly

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,930
it takes I like has this loading stuff

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,160
but it's only the first time when you

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,090
started because it initializes

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,489
everything and what we're gonna see is

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:47,080
the home page oh god sorry it's a 20

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,930
responsive mode because the screen is so

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,300
small this is better this is can you see

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,980
the text you can see the text okay so

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,170
this is what text wiki looks like out of

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,780
the box it's annex wiki and it's a wiki

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,880
engine so you can create content pages

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,040
you can also create some structured data

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,069
which is the feature that we will use in

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,230
order to turn this into a more job

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,540
oriented like an expert oriented

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,299
solution so normally it's a wiki you

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,870
have a home page you can create some

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,489
pages

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:26,560
I should probably login it could help ya

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:29,109
admin admin so you can you can you have

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,760
pages you don't see the whole I'm gonna

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,260
make it smaller so that you see so

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,180
basically when a normal screen you would

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,160
see it a bit like this in terms of like

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,600
global layout but I'm gonna make it

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,950
bigger so that we can actually read the

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,230
text you can modify pages you have an

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,820
editor you can do text and then you can

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,519
do saving of the changes that you've

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,640
done so far nothing surprising nothing

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,930
different from what you would be used to

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,900
when it comes to a wiki you can already

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,630
use it like this for an internet because

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,350
you can you already have a place to put

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,329
content a place to create users put them

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,069
in groups and give give rights to the

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,280
people for example if you go to the

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:12,100
administration you can actually create a

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,639
user already there's already the admin

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:23,130
and you can create a user for example

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:23,130
the Ross Berry okay

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,850
and we create a user now we have a new

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,640
user this guy can now login and use the

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,200
wiki himself as well so this already

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,090
exists you already have this in the

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,010
platform you don't need to do anything

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,260
in order to have that so we can do

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,750
content but we want to take it further

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,320
than this for example we want to be able

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,150
to handle news we want to announce

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,800
things to people to make blog articles

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,320
and things like that so we're going to

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,730
go in the extensions area of the wiki

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,410
which is the interesting part and

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,570
they're going to start installing

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:02,940
applications in order to add extra

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,530
features to this platform so I'm going

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,690
to do a trick because normally they come

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,790
from the internet but here Internet is

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,210
not the best place to go to so I

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,260
downloaded them locally and I'm gonna

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,630
try to install them from the local

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:25,110
folder so i have a blog application that

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:26,790
I can install now I'm gonna cut the

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,470
Internet of this because it's resolving

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:34,730
everything on the internet and it should

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,730
resolve it in local now I have it

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,870
okay yes we should have hold held hands

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,570
under the rainbow in order to make the

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:55,229
demo work this apparently no it's not

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,540
gonna time up it's just a bit longer so

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,100
now I have a blog application and if I

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,750
go to the home page or refresh the page

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,000
I will see it here in the list of

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,370
applications so I have a blog I click

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,570
and I can create a blog article here for

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:15,010
example apricots sorry in English is

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,930
apricot with a P R here because we're

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,169
creating jams so it would be interesting

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,960
for people to know that apricots are

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:27,340
here I have lots of features in this I

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:33,460
can add an image in my blog post here

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:36,610
upload the screen is incredibly small I

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:41,979
don't see anything on it I'm sorry for

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:45,639
that so we have this sent to the server

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:48,729
okay we have an image I can then select

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,760
this image as being the the the display

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,710
image of my blog post it's a news and I

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,770
will also publish my blog post I'm going

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,479
quickly through this you can go into the

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,880
detail of the applications just to show

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:06,070
you that this actually this this

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,570
actually works like this so you have we

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,300
have a blog we have the list of all the

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,650
blog posts here and so on this job is

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,539
done now we can have somebody that

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,930
publishes blog posts for people to see

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:18,639
on this intranet next step is we are

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,380
thinking about okay we have regular

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,880
pages we're gonna create content what we

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,400
want to do is we want to put meeting

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,260
notes because in any company any group

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,789
of people that work together we're gonna

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,280
have meetings and we want to put the

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,580
notes so what I'm gonna do is that I'm I

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,260
could actually use regular pages for for

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,550
the meeting notes but I can also install

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,169
an extension in the same way I can

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,729
install an extension that would allow me

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,060
to handle better my meeting notes

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:48,490
because I will be able to have it in the

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,260
list of applications I have the list of

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,599
all my meetings here so far there is

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,620
none and for example I can say that I

00:07:52,599 --> 00:08:02,100
want to make a sale

00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:04,600
meeting February 2020 and I have lots of

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,430
metadata like structured metadata about

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,500
these meetings normally I would have

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,810
like a regular text page and I would

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,729
just type text I have a structured

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,350
version of the of the page this is a

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,660
feature this is a core feature of week's

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,330
wiki being able to have structured stuff

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,510
in your wiki besides regular wiki pages

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,270
so I can I can use these applications to

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,419
make my data more meaningful and to be

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,699
able to to handle it better as you can

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,039
see all the work is already done so I

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,630
have these beautiful forms they have all

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,469
the controls that I need I don't need to

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:41,229
work to do any of this basically and

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,969
it's free because it's I almost said

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,650
it's free because it's open source it's

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,410
free because it's free and the open

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,180
source is a is another thing so let's

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,040
say that raspberry is the leader of this

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,810
meeting and the meeting is in

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,630
preparation normally I would say here

00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:02,920
what we need to talk about and I can put

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,600
the notes in here okay I have my meeting

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,880
and now I have a list of all the

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,890
meetings that are here because the data

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,410
is structured and this is very important

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:15,940
because the data is structured I can

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:19,089
actually yeah and then we affect sorry

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,420
for that because the data is structured

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,250
I can actually do this filtering this

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,320
very precise filtering of the metadata

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,300
of the data that I put in if the data

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,310
was in structured just takes I would

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,470
never be able to filter by status here

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,390
for example to have a table of all the

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,150
data and and have them filtered

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,589
precisely by a certain value of the

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,360
metadata so I forgot what else I wanted

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:48,160
to show you as I think I wanted to show

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:54,330
you the task manager no.not users

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,330
extensions still extensions so

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,410
come on

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,040
so now I have also a test manager and it

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,280
also appears here in the list of

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,410
applications so the test manager kind of

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,450
is the same as the meeting you have a

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,940
structure you have a table of all the of

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,780
all the all the tasks you when you

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:31,090
create a new task for example create a

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:33,910
social media strategy you can assign it

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,330
to somebody you can add a priority to it

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,940
you can actually it's high priority it's

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:46,180
in to do you can have an assignee for it

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:49,480
and everything so now I have the list of

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,100
all my tasks and and and I can see them

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,140
here I can filter them because the data

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,880
is structured so there's lots of things

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,770
that are already done like this that you

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
can use in you can install there's an

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,150
ideas application for people to add

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,540
ideas there's a bunch of Human Resources

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,800
applications such as holiday request

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,690
application and the recruitment

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,790
application I also wanted to show you

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,750
that but I'm a bit out of time now so

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm gonna go quickly

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,590
so this basically allows you for example

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,260
the Human Resources application allow

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,970
you to have some structuring of the of

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,680
the work that you do like not only send

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,290
emails between people now I want to go

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,900
to holidays sure go to holidays it's it

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,160
can work by email but you want it to

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,410
have a little to have it a little bit

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,540
more structured and what you would want

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,810
also is to kind of save money and and

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,150
not and not spend money on one solution

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,600
for each of the of the needs of your of

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,030
your small to medium company what's very

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,770
interesting here is that as soon as I

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,630
create content in the wiki it's

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,270
automatically searchable because that's

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,540
how the wiki works so for example if I

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,970
look for social media now I will

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,860
actually find the tasks that I have just

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,690
created so it's not separate data it's

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,760
it's data like any other data in the

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,490
wiki and as soon as I put data in there

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,350
it is indexed by the solar engine and I

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,910
have this powerful thing that allows me

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,590
to search everything that I have in

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,630
terms of knowledge so far so good but it

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,500
looks ugly right we want to give it like

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:22,770
like like beautiful colors of

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,630
of a peach workers of sorry JAMA workers

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,640
so I'm gonna go to the color themes I'm

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,670
going to copy this default color theme

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,680
which is the one being used and I will

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,920
create a new one called

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,170
oblique oh because this is the name of

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,700
my company can you still see the text it

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,300
will be so much more comfortable for me

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:47,320
to see the actual size of the screen

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,180
thank you very much and basically I'm

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,240
going to edit this color theme so it's

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,550
really really easy to make it your own

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
like to customize it and color it to

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,460
make it look exactly like you want for

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,090
example I will use I think this is the

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:07,420
logo that I built yesterday sorry that

00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:11,170
we pay the company to build I will

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,740
change some colors to make it more white

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:20,830
I will put my links I will make them

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,470
orange for example more orange more

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,890
orange and I will also change the color

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,380
of the navigation bar up there so the

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:34,480
navigation bar we're gonna make it white

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:36,190
I may be going extremely quickly but

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,250
what I want to show you is that it is

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,320
possible to do this really quickly not

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,640
how exactly will you do it when you will

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,380
do it you'll probably spend a little bit

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,690
more time finding the buttons but link

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,050
color over color no white is not good

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,580
because we won't be able to read it

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,750
still some orange I can actually copy

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:03,490
this orange it's so much easier there

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:09,670
and this is all so ugly we're gonna make

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:13,300
it white sure okay let's go save and

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,730
view so far it's still looking as it

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,560
looked before because I didn't set the

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,680
wiki to use this color team so I'm gonna

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,350
go to the administration and in the

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,880
theme section I will choose the apricot

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:31,540
color team save

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,079
and now my wiki's orange-like using the

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,360
colors that I wanted to use what I also

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,069
want to do at this point is okay I don't

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,839
like these panels they don't represent

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,790
what I want to see I don't care about

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,130
these tips I don't care about these

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,870
things and my home page is ugly so what

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,300
I will do is that I will also I will

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:55,660
also go to the administration I can

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:58,120
actually handle all this these

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,589
applications here I'm gonna remove some

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,649
of them for example I don't care about

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,870
the help I don't care about the sandbox

00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,610
I want blog I want the dashboard at the

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,810
end blog meetings test manager dashboard

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:15,339
I save this and I can also say that I

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:21,130
want these panels to be a small column

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:26,470
and I will move the navigation over here

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,899
and remove all these stuff tip and I

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:35,519
read their tips I want to move it sorry

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,519
to the mean come on come on come on

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,689
yeah of course they're already there but

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:46,000
I want them to disappear from the right

00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:47,589
panel okay no worries it's at the end

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm not going to spend too much time on

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,910
that what I wanted to show is that

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,949
without any coding whatsoever

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,610
what I managed to do is that okay fixed

00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:00,100
it sorry

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,930
quick really quick so without any coding

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,120
what I managed to do is to give it a

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,310
look and feel that corresponds to my

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,379
company to handle the applications that

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,899
I want to see here to make it a little

00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:12,699
bit easier to work on and now what we're

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,339
gonna do we're gonna work basically on

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,050
the on the home page what I want to do

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,139
about the home page is I want to just

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,540
remove all this content and make it my

00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:24,430
own what's interesting is that I can

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,470
actually include another page in here

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:31,870
and I'm going to include the dashboard

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:36,250
so I'm gonna make it display I can use

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:41,680
macros this is a feature of the of the

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:44,050
of the wiki I can use macros in order to

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,399
say that I I want to use I want to show

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,779
in this page another page so right now I

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,790
have a beautiful dashboard with the

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,870
pages of my wiki and with the Activity

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,120
Stream of my wiki

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,680
there's also notifications included in

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,779
this so I have a notifications panel

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,730
here I can configure email notifications

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,410
whenever there is a change on the wiki I

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,870
get notifications by email and so on

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,130
which is something that you may want

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,600
when you do an intranet because you want

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,000
to know what's happening you want to

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,120
know you want to know what what's what's

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,630
happening on your wiki and how it works

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,089
I'm going to show you now two features

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,520
that are interesting features of the

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,890
experi platform that help you make this

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,630
intranet really your own because we

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,819
install some applications but there will

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,710
never be an application for example or

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,580
maybe there will not be an application

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,700
in order to define for example the Jama

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,470
recipes that we want to use because we

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,360
have some like some specific data some

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,330
specific knowledge about our job of

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,890
making jam so what's interesting is with

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,900
the quick is that you can create your

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,909
own application we saw the meeting

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,890
application we saw the task manager but

00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,559
we can also create one that corresponds

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,429
exactly to what I want it to be I

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,139
here I create an application this

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,120
feature is called up within minutes I

00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:03,789
think this is exactly what is left out

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,149
of this presentation minutes so let's

00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:10,570
try to make it in minutes so jam recipes

00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:14,889
I'm gonna call it the recipes I think

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:18,220
it's written like that and what I want

00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:22,149
here for example is I will want a name

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:29,309
of the here I will want a name I'm gonna

00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:32,080
call this name I will want an actual

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:34,240
recipe itself because we're not going to

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,860
structure the data about the recipe it's

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,110
still going to be text but we want to

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,529
add some interesting metadata for

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:45,399
example what we want is we would want to

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:48,159
know - we - which season this recipe

00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:51,129
applies so I'm adding here a property in

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:57,610
my application a metadata of type list

00:18:51,129 --> 00:19:04,090
and I'm going to define here summer I'm

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:10,269
going to define spring and I'm going to

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:13,330
define autumn and I'm going to remove

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:17,039
these default choices is it on it's on

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:20,110
I'm gonna remove some different choices

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:24,159
what I also want to do so right now this

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,869
is done what I also want to do is for

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,669
example I want to say that one user of

00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:30,309
my internet so one member of my company

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,899
is the expert of that recite so what I

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:37,029
will do I will add the property of type

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:38,889
user I will call it expert and that's it

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,809
it should do the job what I will do also

00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,299
is to move the content to the end

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:46,570
because this actually defines the order

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:52,509
that I'm gonna see in my form I'm gonna

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:54,369
move it here come on at the end I can

00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,960
configure bunch of stuff in this

00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:57,429
application I'm not gonna do it now

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,480
because it's long and I only have

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:03,730
minutes and for example I'm going to add

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,710
in my in my table of data on the home

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,830
page I'm gonna

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,690
the season and remove the location so

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,690
this allows me to configure that table

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,490
of existing data that we saw I can

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,149
choose an icon for my stuff is there any

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,750
fruit here no but this is the closest to

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:24,390
nature that I have let's go I have an

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,130
application it took me they all the

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,100
whole three minutes so now I have my own

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:34,980
application that I see here and for

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:37,679
example I can add apricot jam and the

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,870
metadata that I have defined is here

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,630
I'm gonna call Ross an expert he's an

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:48,330
expert in anything here is going to be

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:51,080
the story of their site you will

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,299
understand what I'm when I'm typing text

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,820
I'm saving I have my data here that is

00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,700
displayed structured and as I said

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:07,320
before magically everything is in so if

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:10,710
I look here for best apricot jam I will

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,230
find my recipe that I have just defined

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,779
so basically sorry Allan I just saw that

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,490
so basically with with a couple of

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,200
extensions that I have installed stuff

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,760
that I have defined in the end still I

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,919
didn't show you all the stuff that takes

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,390
week you can do I have an internet I

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,100
have a place for the people that work

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,620
together to put all their data and to

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,470
find it really easily and also get

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,600
spammed by email when it gets updated

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,529
because that's what we all work for spam

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,529
thank you

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:48,100
are there yeah sorry

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,100
sure go ahead

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,070
actually there is an extension that is

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,120
called work flow that does this oh sorry

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,679
I need to repeat the question the

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,919
question was can I attach an approval

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,750
workflow we the feature is not in the

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,130
wiki itself in the platform in the wiki

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,039
platform itself because week is about

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,840
everybody contributing but yes there's

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,179
an extension that is called publication

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,200
workflow if you're interested and it

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,090
does exactly that

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:20,770
it does stuff that gets published only

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:20,770
when only when somebody signs off yes

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,330
yes so the question is whether it

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,130
supports integration and Active

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,080
Directory it was in the list of stuff in

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,000
the pitch about what I will show you I

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,860
didn't show you but in the extensions so

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,049
just as I start blog and task manager

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,299
you can actually install plugins that

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,600
will delegate the authentication of the

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:49,010
wiki in like with a non protocol like

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:50,750
open ID LDAP and things like that the

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,130
widget infrastructure do I need to host

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:57,350
it on it is Java so you will need a

00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:01,520
container for for Java it's called the

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,350
application server for Java I have seen

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,809
it used mostly with Tomcat but I guess

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,299
you can put any other any other one a

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,580
relational database I have seen it to

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,470
use more mostly with MySQL but also with

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,860
Postgres SQL and also with Oracle

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,640
because people do that and Microsoft SQL

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:24,110
I think I saw it used with that and we

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:26,030
usually put an HTTP server like an

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,130
Apache or an engineer's in front of that

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,289
in front of that Tomcat so you will need

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,270
this stack basically and then in terms

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,820
of machine I think it needs to start at

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,320
about the CPU is more or less important

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,270
because there's not much processing what

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,039
you will care for the most is the ramp

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,900
basically you will need the RAM and you

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,150
will need maybe a couple of gigabytes of

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,650
this space and couple of maybe two

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,600
gigabytes of RAM but you can also make

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,200
it run on less depending on how many

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,320
people you're gonna have on that

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,090
there's a debian package in the docker I

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,609
forgot the name of the docker stuff what

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:09,609
is it called the docker image docker

00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:10,989
image to test that yes is there a way to

00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,909
install the extensions within the

00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:18,970
installation process rather than through

00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:20,499
the wiki no no there's no check boxes at

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,029
the install time but you can actually

00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:24,609
make that happen it's not that hard

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,590
to make it actually that the UI that we

00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:28,929
saw initially the blue UI that also is

00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,090
not installed out of the box when you

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,470
first open you your wiki you have wizard

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,239
I didn't show you that wizard but you

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,039
normally have it you have a wizard that

00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,950
asks you what do you want on your wiki

00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,809
so if you want to make your own type of

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,820
packages that you would distribute you

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,100
can also do that and by default it will

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,159
install your packages which contain also

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:54,279
some extensions not the default one and

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:56,559
then you have to do it manually any

00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:01,269
other question okay

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:04,149
yes what is the purpose of the sandbox

00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:06,460
application we deliver it by default

00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:09,159
with the default UI as I said this

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,989
default UI is just what the extra key

00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,450
standard project has chosen to deliver

00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:15,669
but you can make your own default stuff

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,739
the purpose is for people to try out for

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:20,289
example the modification of pages and

00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:22,029
the syntax like how does it work what

00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,989
you can do the macros I think without

00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:27,789
actually touching any serious content

00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:35,340
it's a playground yes it's a it's a

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:35,340
playground indeed thank you very much

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,270
