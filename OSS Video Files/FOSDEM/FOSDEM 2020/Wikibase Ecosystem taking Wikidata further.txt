Wikidata, Wikimedia's knowledge base, has been very successful since its inception 7 years ago. Wikidata's general purpose data about the world is powering everything from Wikipedia to your digital personal assistant. Its linked, machine readable data is collected and maintained by a community of over 20000 people. But not all data should and can be in Wikidata. Instead we are taking the software powering Wikidata, Wikibase, to new places. We empower communities and institutions all around the world who want to collect structured, machine-readable data about a topic area of their choice to run their own Wikibase. These Wikibase instances are then connected to form a thriving ecosystem. In this talk we'll go over what Wikibase is, where it's coming from and what it is enabling right now.

	00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,660
we're going to talk about the wiki based

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,200
ecosystem indeed we're going to talk

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,200
about editable link data for everyone

00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:38,270
yeah it all started with wiki data wiki

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,250
data is Wikimedia is knowledgebase and

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,390
it provides general structured data

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,370
about the world to Wikipedia so when you

00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:52,660
look at the Wikipedia article today and

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:55,460
you see the info box on the side with

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,000
basic facts about the topic you're

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,900
reading about then that might come from

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,690
wiki data and it's a central place that

00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,680
stores all this data for Wikipedia in a

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,170
language independent way so that

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,560
everyone all the Wikipedia language

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:21,729
traditions can benefit from it and wicca

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:26,420
data has become rather successful after

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:31,070
seven years of it existing now we have

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:36,649
around 12,500 people who edit at least

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:40,429
once at least five times a month and we

00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:42,950
describe almost 75 million things in the

00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,899
world like this could be this building

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,740
this could be Brussels this could be a

00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:56,569
famous actor this could be a movie

00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:01,160
things like that how does this look like

00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:04,520
in practice when you go to wicked era

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,880
today you might find pages like this one

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,870
about Margaret Hamilton and find out

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,400
that she was an American NASA scientist

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,170
and mathematician that there are 41

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,370
different language versions of Wikipedia

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:27,110
who have an article about her and if you

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:32,540
didn't know that yet she also was a

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,380
human but now you love machines who are

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,569
also supposed to notice for them that's

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,209
not quite so obvious so we record stuff

00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,530
like that as well and if you go further

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,230
down a bit you will

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,760
and things like that she was developer

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:54,230
on the Apollo space program for example

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:57,140
and if you go even further you will find

00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:02,830
links to a ton of other places on the

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:06,500
internet other websites other catalogs

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,560
libraries and so on where you find more

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,610
information about her

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,060
and now imagine that all nearly 75

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:21,650
million times about many different

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,900
things so this is what it looked like at

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,660
the beginning right you have wiki data

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,050
in the middle and it provides data to

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,140
these other Wikimedia projects like

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:40,280
Wikipedia wikivoyage Wikimedia Commons

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:44,200
and many others and then with all these

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,600
connections to these other databases we

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,269
build up a Semantic Web or a part of the

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,910
Semantic Web that connects all this

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:58,070
information both readable by humans but

00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:00,470
also by machines and this is then used

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,390
by for example your personal assistant

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,440
digital assistant to answer your

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,440
questions or if you get a quick answer

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,380
in your search results that might be

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,239
powered by that or your local library

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,000
system might provide you with additional

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,709
information about the author and their

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,300
books and then that might also come from

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:26,840
there now with Weka data

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:31,300
quietly gaining a lot of traction and

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:35,169
attention we had a problem because all

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,880
this data is maintained by a community

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:43,880
for the world and we reached a point

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,880
where lots and lots of people wanted to

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,229
put more and more specialized data into

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,430
wiki data without necessarily being

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,909
willing and able to maintain that over

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,909
the long run

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,750
and we said like wicked a there should

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,940
be a very central place in the Semantic

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,210
Web but it shouldn't have all the data

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,490
because that's not what the Semantic Web

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,410
was about writes about decentralizing

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,410
and connecting and linking information

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,730
so lots of people approached us like can

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,860
we run our own thing can't we run our

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,330
own wiki data and that's what we made

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,610
possible so the software that's running

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,980
wiki data is called wiki base and over

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,320
the last two years we have put a lot of

00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,800
work into making it possible for other

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,290
people organizations companies to run

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,620
their own wiki base with the idea that

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,200
at some point we have a picture that

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,960
looks like this which would be the wiki

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,060
based ecosystem where all the data that

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,000
we already have and all the data that we

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,440
already connect to it's further enriched

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,720
and connected to many different

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,590
individual wiki's that publish

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,100
specialized data so you could imagine

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,840
there's famous German marmalade producer

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,760
they have lots of marmalade germs and

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,920
chutneys and they might have their own

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,260
wiki base about Marlon's gems and

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,900
chutneys where they describe all the

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,840
ingredients and how they connect to

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,890
other varieties of the same marmalade

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,200
for example and then if you're really

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,180
interested in mallets you go to that

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,810
wiki and find all the information you

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,810
could ever ask for

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:40,970
so since we've been doing this there are

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,490
quite a few installations out there

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,790
already that do really cool stuff with

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,640
wiki base and connected to wiki data and

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:53,180
other wiki base installations this for

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,510
example is a lingua Libre lingua Libre

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,360
is a project to help people record

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,280
pronunciations so that other people who

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,930
don't speak their language can hear how

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,760
a word is pronounced and they structure

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,900
their word lists and their connections

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,340
to wiki data

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:16,520
through their own wiki-based instance

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:19,340
for example or we have sacred which is a

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,860
database that collects data about the

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,410
humanities and they started out with

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,060
data about the Illuminati yes this is a

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:32,860
real thing

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,860
so they recorded things like all always

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,120
anonymous people wrote to other

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,780
anonymous people also who was behind

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,229
this

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,990
when did they write to each other what

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,699
did they write about and you can once

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,710
you have all that data connected and

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,560
queryable it becomes really interesting

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,440
to ask questions about it'll be not you

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,780
for example by now they expanded into

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:02,500
other humanities data as well but that's

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:08,860
how they started or you have rhizome

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:14,000
which is a museum for digital born art

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:17,510
you might remember some at the beginning

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,060
of the web and as it grew artists have

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:24,740
played with for example technical

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:30,139
glitches and browsers exploiting box and

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:32,209
so on to create art and that art is

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,419
preserved by this organization called

00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:37,250
rhizome who is now cataloging it in

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,409
their own wiki base instance to make it

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,750
easier to find to figure out which

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,669
browser version in which operating

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,860
system you need to use to actually be

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:54,080
able to see what the artist had intended

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:57,080
and so on or we have wiki base instant

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,970
called personal data i/o and they are

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,480
trying to do something about

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,670
surveillance capitalism by helping

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,020
people have conversations about it by

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:12,620
exposing how personal data is used by

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:18,829
connecting organizations that that fight

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:21,900
against and provide alternatives very

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:26,430
worthy goal in my opinion

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:28,500
and then to sum up the the few showcases

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,390
we're currently working with a lot of

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,460
national libraries for example the

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,650
German National Library the French

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:41,790
National Library as well as some library

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:46,830
groups on trialing wiki base as a system

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:52,380
for their own internal cataloging

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,880
systems or as documentation to that now

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,680
you might think why are all these people

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,150
using wiki base what makes it special

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,090
and there's many reasons for that but

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,280
let me highlight some the first one is

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,580
that it's actually added to polling data

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,910
like Wikipedia you can enable your

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,510
editors your users to change your data

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,670
to contribute to it to augment it and a

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,710
lot of the existing link data that is

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,440
out there is read-only and this is a way

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,920
to change that and and give people the

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,690
power to support your cause or your

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,540
organization in contributing to it

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:37,130
through additional data to Corrections

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:41,610
and so on then thanks to its foundation

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,710
in Wikimedia it has community at the

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,650
core so there are many features in wiki

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,030
base already that help you build a

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:53,060
community and help that community

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:58,380
organize that is things like tor pages

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,630
user rights and much more which existing

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,340
library systems for example have a very

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:07,970
hard time for writing the other thing

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:13,380
that's really important for people is

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:16,500
multilingual @ e so the screenshots I

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,270
showed you we're all in English but with

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,210
a click of a button I can show you the

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,280
very same data in German in French or in

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,630
any other language that you that you

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,990
would like and that someone has

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,100
contributed translations for but you're

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,100
working on the same data

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,930
and another thing that is really

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,240
intriguing people said wiki bases build

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,230
with the idea in mind that the world is

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,390
very complex and that we want to capture

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,590
that complexity and data and that is

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:56,060
very hard but I think we've gotten quite

00:11:51,590 --> 00:12:00,110
far in making that possible so the world

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,690
is weird for example at some point

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,480
Sweden decided it would be really nice

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:10,570
to have a February serve Shetty's in

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:13,790
just one year because why not just so

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:18,470
the role that February only ever has 29

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,470
or last days nope there's the Swedes

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,480
broke that rule or there was this woman

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,480
who decided to marry the Eiffel Tower

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,020
the world's complex and these

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,370
complexities are exactly what

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,810
Wikipedians want to write about of

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,620
course right because other people want

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,210
to read about it so wiki base was built

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,240
to deal with that and to be able to

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:46,940
express that flexibility and complexity

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:50,120
that the world has and the last thing I

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:54,320
want to mention is this is the

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,270
connection to wiki data if you are

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,940
running a wiki based instance then it's

00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,770
very easy to connect that to wiki data

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,240
and benefit from a lot of the work that

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:07,370
has been done there already in future we

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,930
want to make it very easy for example to

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,520
take over all the decisions that the

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,460
regulator community has already made

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,390
about how to model the world like the

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,490
fact that we want human to have a date

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,100
of birth in a place of birth and that is

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,530
something we want to express that should

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,800
be very easy to take over to your own

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,370
wiki base instance and the other thing

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,070
is that if organizations companies and

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,930
so on are using data from wiki data then

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,660
we want to make it very easy for them to

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,860
also jump to your wiki based instance

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,860
annuity basica system

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,960
and with that I hope I gave you a

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,360
glimpse into the wiki-based

00:13:49,960 --> 00:14:37,200
ecosystem and made you excited to try it

00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:39,820
and join us thank you so wicked data has

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,000
notability guidelines like most

00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:46,440
Wikipedia's have they are very relaxed

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,320
but they're there and they basically say

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,760
anything that has a Wikipedia article

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,800
can have an entry in wiki data anything

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,890
that is described by a reliable source

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,680
out there like a library system for

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,710
example can probably have an entry in

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,710
wiki data and anything that is needed to

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:14,080
fulfill all structural need so let's say

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:16,390
you have a famous person their child was

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,140
not famous but the child of that child

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:22,660
was famous then you can create an entry

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:27,340
for the person in the middle to complete

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:31,390
the chain basically that that's a rough

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,790
guideline and then there's the question

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,970
of how much information do we collect

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,110
about each of those things and for

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:43,000
example as I was saying earlier the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:46,090
marmalade museum is probably too much

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,800
for for wiki data itself and probably

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,960
deserves its own wiki based instance

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,910
also because you can build up a

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,860
community of specialists who really care

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,960
about this particular topic and have a

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,000
lot of experience about it and know how

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,130
to model the difference between a

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,830
chutney and a mammal

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:08,560
and a gem which I do not yeah so and if

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,780
you're really unsure on wicket it's off

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,400
there is a discussion page where you can

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:22,110
bring it up and and get some input from

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:22,110
the editors yeah

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:32,430
how the collaboration between which

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:36,250
media and the libraries works so they

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,140
they have the ones we are working with

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,060
they have dedicated people inside the

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,160
library who are tasked with evaluating

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,760
wiki base for their particular use case

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,390
and then we regularly exchange with them

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,910
we have meetings with them to talk about

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,040
what they want from Becky Bayes if

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,970
that's already possible with it if we

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,410
need to make changes or if if wiki base

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,520
for that particular case just isn't the

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,220
right thing to use and then over several

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,020
months we go through that every Asian

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,020
phase with them and support them in that

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:34,030
right so right now it's not just web

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:36,280
links but it's links and links in rdf

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,550
for example that you can follow as you

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,210
do in a Semantic Web we are working on

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:47,080
more advanced Federation features we're

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:49,360
starting now in two weeks or so to start

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,520
building more on top of that so that you

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,040
can take more advantage than you

00:17:51,520 --> 00:18:01,140
currently can on of this distributed

00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:01,140
Ness off of the whole ecosystem yes

00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:28,610
yeah so exactly because of things like

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,610
that and we have build wiki base not

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,480
around the idea of there's one truth out

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:39,889
there that we have to model but you can

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:46,070
have for example conflicting data you

00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:48,499
can have things like China claims that

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,330
everyone belongs to China and it's a

00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:56,240
part of it while Taiwan itself says no

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,309
and you can have those statements next

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,809
to each other and then you have

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,240
something called qualifiers where you

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:07,940
can qualify this for example saying that

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,450
this this particular statement is

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,779
supported by the United Nations or you

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,889
can say that this is based on a

00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:22,669
particular treaty for example or that

00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:26,210
something was true only from one point

00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:28,159
in time to another in the past so

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:32,779
there's a lot of flexibility in that

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,759
it's of course not able to express all

00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:37,850
the complexity in the world that you can

00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,379
think of but it gets quite a lot farther

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,379
than typical databases

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:55,920
right so what we're starting to work on

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:59,040
now is the ability to use wiki data's

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,440
properties and items to in your own wiki

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,280
base instance so that everyone would be

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,500
able to use the same vocabulary ideally

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,200
how that plays out we have to see but I

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,180
have high hopes yeah

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,180
so that that is the idea for now and of

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,810
course there's a lot of links and same s

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,150
links as understood in the Semantic Web

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,350
so that you can say okay if they are

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,020
talking about this concept that's the

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:37,490
same thing they are talking about and

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:44,540
then you can follow those yes

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:48,870
so medium wikipedia has said - yeah

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,410
maybe Faden can help you understand more

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,890
of that but there's a change of stream

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:59,270
that you can follow both looking at a

00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,270
website but also we are AP eyes

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:15,700
sorry I have a hard time understanding

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,700
you yes

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:31,190
so the initial storing and editing of

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:35,330
the data happens in MediaWiki and then

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:37,880
for querying and answering more complex

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,920
questions on that data we have a spotter

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:58,280
endpoint and we use place graph for that

00:21:41,920 --> 00:22:01,190
place graph yes so we want to start in

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,910
the next two weeks and then roll out the

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:08,240
first version of that hopefully in very

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,310
few months depending on how it goes and

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,950
then iterate on that based on what

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,260
people tell us they need in addition so

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,810
the first version will be very simple

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,550
you will be able to use only the

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,940
properties that wiki data provides like

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:25,730
date of birth place of birth links to

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,180
other databases and so on and then we'll

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,180
build on that

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:47,410
do you have some way of dealing with so

00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,960
wicked in itself right so we get it

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:55,300
itself as CC 0 so only data that is

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,790
licensed to 0 it's supposed to go into

00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,520
wicked data which is one of the reasons

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,170
why organizations might decide to run

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,080
their own pretty business it's because

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:09,580
they can't release their data under

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,170
under C 0 and then it would be up to the

00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,880
consumer to decide because they see

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,420
where the data is coming coming from and

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,230
that wiki has a has a license

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,210
declaration and I would then need to see

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:33,010
depending on how they use that data

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:33,190
comply with the license thank you very

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,180
much

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,180
