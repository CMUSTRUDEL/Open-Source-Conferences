Description: 
	Regaining control of your smartphone with postmarketOS and Maemo Leste Status of Linux on the smartphone
by Merlijn B. W. Wajer and Bart Ribbers

At: FOSDEM 2020
https://video.fosdem.org/2020/Janson/smartphones.webm

Linux mobile software and GNU/Linux distributions are currently not widely available for smartphones. This talk covers why it is desirable to have GNU/Linux (not: Android or Android-based) on your smartphone, what the current state of various software attempts at Linux on smartphones is, what progress has been made, and will also dive into the available old and new hardware (including the PinePhone and Librem 5) to run the software &amp; distributions on.
Smartphones running regular (F)OSS Linux distributions are not common. We intend to provide an overview of the current Linux FOSS mobile stacks, distributions that package/provide the mobile stacks and to discuss the hardware that one can use to run this software. We will provide additional details for the postmarketOS distribution and for Maemo Leste (Debian based FOSS mobile software). We also hope to go into some detail about the upcoming PinePhone (https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/)


postmarketOS is a distribution based on alpine, with a focus on minimalism, security and mobile software. postmarketOS supports many old and new smartphones with varying degrees of support, and also packages/ships with various mobile software suites like Plasma Mobile, Maemo/Hildon, Phosh and more.


Maemo Leste is based on Maemo Fremantle (from the Nokia N900 days), but completely open source. It's a repository on top of Debian/Devuan that pulls in the entire Maemo/Hildon user interface and suite of applications. Building on top of a proven set of interfaces, Maemo Leste also aims to be mostly compatible with Maemo the way many people might remember it, with a modern twist.


Pine64 (known for ARM laptops and SBC (Single Board Computers) has decided to get into the mobile business with the PineTab and the PinePhone device. Aiming to deliver developer devices in 2020Q1 and enthusiastic end-user devices in 2020Q2, they've energized software developers who arewriting mobile interfaces for Linux and have been producing a mobile phone at remarkable pace. We will show the Pine64 device and discuss the current state of Linux support on the device.


We plan to give live demos during the presentation, but will have pre-recorded videos as fallback.

	00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:17,910
so it's 1,500 it's time for the next

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,240
talk by Merlin and Bart and I'm really

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,120
looking forward to this talk because

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,460
it's not as I perceive the project not

00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,500
only about regaining control over your

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,410
smartphones which is of course very good

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,930
but it's also to be able to keep your

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,820
phones longer even if there's no further

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,820
support from vendors anymore that's what

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,600
else I also like but let's get more

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:53,640
first-hand facts from Marilyn and Bart

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:57,329
enjoy thank you does it work yeah works

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,979
good okay so I'm relying this is Bart

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,210
I'm gonna briefly tell you what we're

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,979
gonna be talking about that will

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:10,110
introduce ourselves and we'll roll right

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:11,759
into the contents so this is better so

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,890
our talk is titled say there's a few

00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,009
looks on the smartphone how to liberate

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,719
your device by running actual Linux and

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,969
software you control so we're going to

00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,880
briefly introduce ourselves first then I

00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,799
will talk about why why we need the

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,630
Linux in the smartphone like why do we

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,950
need it I think the answer is obvious

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,530
but maybe this isn't so we're gonna

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,270
discuss that for a while then I'll talk

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,579
about some hard and hardware problems

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,020
and potential solutions to that then

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,030
Bart will give you an overview of all

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,649
the existing software out there like all

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,259
the different efforts that people are

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,329
undertaking he'll talk about post-market

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,270
less and I'll say I'll talk about my mom

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,259
and by that time we should get to

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,359
questions so my name is Merlin or

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,740
merlion in Dutch I studied at the

00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,350
University of Amsterdam I did computer

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,820
science I do work for the into the

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,469
archive park I've worked it at the

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,990
wayback machine the archived webpages

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,259
and books and CDs and all the cool stuff

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,660
and in my spare time at night I work on

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,400
my Melissa I am also a board member of

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,209
the MCM hacker space have been for a

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,910
while and I run tor exits and and work

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:49,920
on other free software projects

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:54,420
so my name is okay so why should you run

00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:05,490
Linux on your smartphone there's a

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:07,170
couple of reasons first of all so how

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,090
many of you are running iOS or Android

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,590
just raise your hands

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,140
iOS or Android how many of you are

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,870
running Android most of you are running

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,130
Android right so Android runs Linux of

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,110
some kind

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,100
but it's not really new Linux how much

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,900
of you how many of you are running

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,550
glinted us it's like 5% of the people

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,350
that just raise their hands so most of

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,240
you use Android that was installed by

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,320
your vendor which could be Motorola or

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,930
Google or some other hardware vendor and

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,860
if you look at what we do on our laptops

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,400
like how many people if you were running

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:45,750
Linux in your laptop right did you

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,040
install it yourself yeah okay but we do

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,870
this on our servers we do this on our

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,780
desktops we do this on our laptops but

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,680
we don't do it on our phones and there

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,230
are many reasons for that

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,940
and we'll get to some of those reasons

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,470
but first why would you want that so

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,780
obviously if you run your software on

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,320
your phone on your laptop you have full

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,750
control

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,250
you re already having you decide what

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,320
runs you dislike what this show you want

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,850
you decided you want no more KDE or

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Wayland or xorg

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,880
or sway or whatever you want to run and

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,100
I think that's very important I think

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,720
that's what draws a lot of different

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,760
crowds and and you know binds us

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,980
together in the fact that we can work on

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,980
all these different things and

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,380
it gives you different and we have the

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,380
free to modify whatever we want so we

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,610
can change the software we can fix stuff

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,620
we can work with the community to make

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,000
all this better and with the smartphone

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,380
so you really can't with Apple

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,850
it's just they work on something and

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,520
that's it maybe you can report a bug and

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,960
you'll hear something in a couple months

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,570
Google does some some of the code is

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,310
open source but they work in a closed

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,010
way so every now and then they just drop

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,720
code and that's kind of it so there's no

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,150
way that we as a community here can can

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,070
work together currently there's some

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,210
efforts to do that but they're not super

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,470
well-known yeah and of course if you if

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,150
you have an Android phone right now

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,790
you're depending on your manufacturer if

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,800
Motorola supports Android until 6.0 then

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,540
if you Android 7.0 is released or their

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,880
security fixes you have to wait from the

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,360
fix it or flash lenders arrest if it

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,130
supports your device and there's no

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,510
support and they usually they make you

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,080
get a new device every couple years

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,630
which is not ideal because you know I'm

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,760
still using my Nokia and 100 and have

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,680
been for the last ten years and it still

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,390
works fine and very often Android has

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,430
basically iOS as well had they have

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,570
spyware built into some point at the

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,880
point of you know like if you have your

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,380
phone you know it's tracking you in some

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,640
way and you have to figure out all these

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,410
different ways of tracks you have to

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,670
deny permissions for everything it gets

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,050
very tricky and I think the right way to

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,640
do it is to start where the device it

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,310
doesn't track you at all in any way and

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,920
then start reasoning about how you can

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,450
make it not vacuum very often there's a

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,160
lot of bloatware super large apps and

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,050
logins of different communication

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,720
platforms and I think that's not not a

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,780
good thing for the community as well ok

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,310
so what does it mean if we want to be in

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,820
control we don't want to be dependent on

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,830
five mind if I here what do we need so I

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,680
think you sense your pieces of a glint

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,560
like smartphone is that it has mainline

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,090
Linux support and for those of you who

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
don't know mainline Linux means that you

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,260
can go to kernel.org your website of

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,120
Linux you download the latest release

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,650
and you can build a free device and it

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,390
works more or less though there might be

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,700
some driver issues but it just works and

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,590
for most of your Android devices you

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,770
can't do that it won't be supported in

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,509
Linux because the vendors

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,250
made some changes and maybe if you're

00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,400
lucky you can get two changes as the

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,990
last talk covered and that's kind of it

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,300
so if you all want to work together on

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,520
Linux we need this to to be there and we

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,680
don't we want most of the drivers to be

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,860
open source so that we can improve the

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,889
drivers make them better and we need a

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,350
boot loader without restrictions so if

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,610
you run a various Android boot loaders

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,000
or something else as long as they allow

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,530
you to boot Linux your own version of

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,389
Linux so it doesn't have it's not signed

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,889
by some cryptographic key and you can

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,199
just do it yourself that's probably good

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,960
enough will be ID you if the boot loader

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
is completely open-source from the start

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,190
but that might not be completely

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,180
realistic and of course if you have

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,380
Linux in the boot loader you need

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,389
something other than the kernel to

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,789
actually do stuff with your phone so we

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,180
need usable user space that's free and

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,039
open source and ideally there will be

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:41,110
many distros and many new eyes like we

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:44,710
have right now in our laptops but

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,810
there's quite some problems so if you

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,150
put your laptop with Intel you just kind

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,030
of insert the whatever your distro is

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,650
maybe you want to CD or USB stick and it

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,750
boots to a bootloader and it's just

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,520
boost to a desktop or you want and you

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,979
can do things on the phone this doesn't

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,570
work that way

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,490
however support an arm is different

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,810
there's no bios that sets everything up

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,310
and downloads a bootloader and then the

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,050
boot will go to the next and Linux tooth

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,300
looks like whatever the BIOS provides

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,400
provides it on on whatever whatever's on

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,560
the PCI bus still local drivers this is

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,570
not their own arm there's no currently

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,130
very good infrastructure to do that

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,659
there's some there's some progress has

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,840
been made but for a lot of the devices

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,940
that doesn't work so that's harder you

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,880
have to often compile your own kernel

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,120
with the right options so you can't just

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,620
plug in something and hope it works and

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,089
of course most of devices that I said

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,709
have been there only only kernels say

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,329
they take take Linux in a certain point

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:38,649
they add some things and that's that's

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:41,500
kind of eight they never contributed

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,360
back the bootloader sometimes even

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,860
lockdown and specifically boot loaders

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,120
here you have to configure the manual

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,110
they often compile them as well because

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,790
they have the same problem they don't

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,350
know what hardware is in your device and

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,750
they

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,370
and detects what what they should

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,120
support so you can render something on

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,880
your screen and there are so many

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,230
devices there's so many different

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,820
Android phones and there's so many

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,220
different Chinese ones and different

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,810
large United States manufacturers and

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,640
let our problem this power management

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,790
power management the desktop and laptop

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,990
is pretty good with Linux nowadays like

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,000
some if you're lucky you can get eight

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,620
or nine hours in your laptop if your

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,870
phone lasts only eight or nine hours in

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,550
your pocket and gets warm it's not a

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,600
very good like you need we need

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,220
something better and with a 64-bit Aram

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,520
some of what I said before got a little

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,530
better so there's some way to detect

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,780
what drivers you have if you have a if I

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:39,060
boot loader then you can kind of do it

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,110
but it's still some problematic so these

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,300
are a lot of problems there's some

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,590
solutions that we as a community can or

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,240
some things we can do as a community to

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,280
hopefully make this a little less

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,980
painful we can focus only only a couple

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,990
devices so take a couple of Android

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,000
phones or whatever phones people might

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,910
that are not that hard to support or are

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
GPL friendly I mean I have GPL fan

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,380
friendly manufacturers that kind of

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,790
stuff will be good or if many people are

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,730
manufacturing new devices they should

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,110
pick a system on ship that is well

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,480
supported by Linux already so

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,400
system-on-chip is basically the computer

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,200
and graphics card most of the things

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,030
integrated in a simple small thing that

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,980
is on your phone and there's actually a

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,810
company doing that or several companies

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,170
doing that will cover them in a bit and

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,360
I think the way to actually get linux

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,580
support proper is not to rely on Android

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,020
and on Android kernel via vendor to

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,230
provide some drivers and then rely on it

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,430
so there's there's some good projects

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,140
abstraction layers around Android and

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,660
Android drivers so you can run your own

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,950
Linux stuff on there but it doesn't get

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,570
us any closer to actual

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,890
mainline Linux on our phones so there

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,330
are two companies working on new devices

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:54,330
right now the first one is pint 64 they

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,460
have a stand in the aw building today I

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,900
think they might have a stand on till 5

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,100
so after it's all finishes you can still

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,920
go there

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,920
and they are showing off their phone and

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,230
tablet with various OSS that currently

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,880
are in alpha state are kind of working

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,610
right now so if you're excited you go

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,980
there and specifically they are working

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,660
on something called the pine phone maybe

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,079
not surprising

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,880
it features an all winner a 64 SOC

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
system-on-chip and it has very good main

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,720
line support and this is not necessarily

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,180
because of the company owner but because

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,470
for the last couple years people who

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,269
visit Boston have been working very

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,800
actively to support the devices because

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,410
you can find a lot of single board

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,790
computers so if you know Raspberry Pi

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,440
ders thought about our boards like that

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,810
like there's only max boards and Pi in

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,459
64 they make boards with ownerships in

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,149
there and you can use them as a small

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:48,490
server at home or as a media box so

00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:50,589
mainline support in Linux is really good

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,300
the driver supports is getting a pretty

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,149
decent there's two gig two gigabyte of

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,740
RAM MMC and a quad core CPU and there's

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,839
an open source PD driver for many years

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,100
specifically 3d in the whole am space

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,899
has been a big problem and I don't I

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,529
think four or five years ago someone

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:13,870
here livvie started working on the Lima

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,730
driver for the mali-400 GPU he did a lot

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,769
of work he did a big talk here on the K

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,819
building a couple years ago and then

00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,709
stopped working on it and then always

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,120
picked it up and now today we actually

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,839
have a driver that works on way on the

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,040
next org so that's awesome and another

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,889
cool thing that the platform features

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,279
are kill switches so if you want to only

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,750
turn off your microphone you just flip a

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,949
physical switch and then the line of

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,300
your microphone no longer runs your

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:41,470
phone's there's no way that whatever you

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,970
say will be recorded by the moment you

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,410
can do the same for Wi-Fi you can turn

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,269
up your cameras you can do the same for

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,300
Bluetooth so that's that's kind of neat

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,430
if you want some extra privacy features

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,720
it features the worldwide 4G LTE modem

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,880
so wherever you go just work and they

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,529
will likely when the phone is finished

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,240
allow you to pick a distribution that

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,009
kind of works on the phone and then

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,319
they'll pre install it for you so it's

00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,319
kind of cool how that work continued

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:17,360
and it costs 150 years approximately the

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,850
the other company is purism is making

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,930
the leap in five this might be more

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,060
known to the community the device is

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,000
actually based on the difference soft

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,940
and the pinecone is it's a bit more

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,440
powerful as well kill switches are

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,390
actually on the outside called a pine

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,520
phone they're on the inside of the phone

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:42,500
so it's a bit hard but easier actually

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,320
to flick the switch the mainline sport

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,940
is also pretty good the still transforms

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,040
from out of three patches but they're

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,570
actively being worked on and being up

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,750
streams from purism they're working on

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,610
the distribution POS which is the main

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,720
focus for the living five probably gonna

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,060
run us out of the box and at the moment

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,100
they have to chestnut relationships that

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,100
just means it's one of the first batches

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,880
that a ship they work in several batches

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,070
meaning the first batch as is basically

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,900
an early version and there might be some

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,090
little issues with it and the next batch

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,010
has no issues fixed and then some issues

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,290
might occur there in the next issue next

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,080
batch has those issues fixed and just a

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,250
tradition is basically for the the

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,490
Braveheart that the people that don't

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,880
really mind having some issues and don't

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,510
mind working around them I think right

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,320
now the price is $800 but it's changing

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,300
a bit so it might not be accurate and

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,650
depending on the reach in your s it uses

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:53,210
a different modem I think especially USA

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,440
versus Europe and Indian but it's

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,720
basically just as promise can define

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,180
phone and hopefully we'll see a lot of

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,100
people next year using is instead of

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,740
their Android phones so to give an

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,870
overview of the currently various

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,450
efforts to put Linux on mobiles and

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,130
there are a lot of distros out there at

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,760
the moment

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,920
just to start somewhere we fkd nail made

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,230
by the KDE projects it's already used on

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,410
desktop a lot and it's just basically

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,980
based on dome over sorry ubuntu with the

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,530
newest KDE stack on it a case of mobile

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,520
they put the newest versions of all the

00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,620
mobile components Kady on it to make it

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,410
work on current phones just not the

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,150
point phone in the liberal 5 but on the

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,060
regular Android phones they use live

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,190
Hybris which is a technique to make

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,210
androids drivers and stuff work on

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,430
regular Linux systems and it's basically

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:56,740
the main the main developments

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,510
distribution for Kady or mobile the next

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,120
one will be a bun to touch this is

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,970
probably the most completed distribution

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,010
at the moment out there it works a bit

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,940
differently than most distributions the

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,160
base system is read-only and they

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,160
install packages with they call to click

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,500
system and if they update the system

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,480
it's just reboots into the coffee motors

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,630
installs the new version then reboots

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,740
into it instead of running say apt-get

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,290
update it counts with unity 8th on most

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,740
devices at the moment it uses again live

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,030
hybrids to work to make the drives work

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,280
but they're quite far advanced as well

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,290
with 0.1 and leaving 5 to make it work

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,510
with mainline drivers and without sleep

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,310
Ivers and if you want to run Linux on

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,260
mobile system like this year and you

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,210
want some apps to run a bunch of Tosh is

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:55,120
probably your best bet then we have Nemo

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,080
mobile based on the originally on mer

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,520
nowadays that's basically sailfish OS

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,170
basically takes sailfish OS but replace

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,750
the proprietary components of it with

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,300
free and open source software that makes

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,780
me come down to the user interface and

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,339
applications that come with it it

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,670
basically runs on every device that

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,260
sailfish OS Ronson let's just replace we

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,699
put a repository of them on top of it

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,000
install the different packages and it

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,000
will run

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,779
now we have loon OS it's based on the

00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,820
older webOS which was made by LG they

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,409
originally discontinued the efforts to

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,929
make repairs and then the community

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:37,440
decided to fork it magnanimous nowadays

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,779
LG has picked of WebQuest again so lunar

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,779
s is nowadays working with LG to bring

00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,249
the all the components back together

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,409
make sure that stays open source and

00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:49,139
it's based on modern techniques and

00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,869
hardware again it uses lip Hybris to

00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:53,369
work instead of mainline drivers but

00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,619
they're working on the pine phone as

00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:59,429
well in which case again to use the

00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,590
mainline drivers properly then we've

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,820
asteroid to West it's big difference

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,210
it's not pretty smartphone the West

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,330
memorial SmartWatch cos it again you

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,109
slip Hybris it's made for the

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,720
smartwatches which basically at the

00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,340
moment or an Android watch it's a

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,739
regular Linux system I think it's based

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,299
on yoke so or openembedded I'm not

00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:24,090
entirely sure the UI and stuff is again

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:28,950
based on mer which is updated in a

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,710
different direction then a OSC it's made

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,919
for more of the Eastern Asian markets

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,109
its main focuses on plasma mobile runs

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,950
on mainline only it doesn't run on any

00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,899
other devices

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,309
that's do not have main lines first

00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:46,559
message at the moment mainly the pine

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:49,379
phone and liberal 5 and then with pure

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,940
OS this is made by purism the company

00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,919
that makes the libram 5 it's mainly

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,960
focused on running on the Libyan 5

00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,220
although also on the other leave

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,679
products over the laptops this is your

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,419
West well ship with Porsche I'm not sure

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,730
how to pronounce properly but it's based

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,679
on the chrome stack they used known

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,980
technologies and they run gnome

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,049
applications but adapter so they are

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,799
made responsive and will resize them to

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:17,369
various

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,399
phone sizes this pure RS is made to only

00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,590
run a mainline kernel scuzz only made to

00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,570
run on leave in 5 really but if here you

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,869
can run on any phone that has mainline

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:33,800
and it's a fork of DAB unit then we've

00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,450
mint Jarrow they pops up recently

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,220
showing they have interest in making a

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,220
mobile version as well it's meant to our

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,020
arm project they focus at the moment on

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,270
plasma mobile but - based on art so

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,260
inferior become anything that ours can

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,880
run and also it's made to run only on

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,650
mainline kernels and at the moment are

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,870
working on magnet pinecone and then we

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,940
have next to s lost year they cut

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,890
funding by an L net to work on it so

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,740
they now have a full-time developer it's

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,410
a standalone OS works a bit differently

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,530
the peck dementia is quite interesting I

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,960
can recommend you look into it it runs

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,370
on the point phone as well but you're

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,620
also trying to get its own run on

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,950
existing Android devices in which case

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,780
again you sleep ibis the test of the

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,550
interfaces will come with it's not set

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,380
in stone yet so working on multiple

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,179
interfaces so you can probably

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,880
eventually run plus mobile and it's a

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:34,220
forge and unity and hopefully lots of

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:36,800
others so postmarked OS that's what I

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:41,030
work on in my opinion the best one but

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,580
probably what others disagree this was

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,190
announced on the 26th of May 2017 by

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,170
Oliver Smith he had worked on it in

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,240
private for a year by then he made some

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,980
basic toolings working it and at that

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,130
point he thought was ready to show it to

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,809
the world when he made the original blog

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,790
post that announced the project's it's

00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,750
only supported two devices or at least

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:05,690
Buddhist on two devices but basically

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,940
now we boot up to hung one on the Ceph

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,500
three three devices it sounds like a lot

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,900
but it's probably not even half of all

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,160
the Android phones out there it's quite

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,040
a lot

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,540
do note we say supports but doesn't mean

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,250
you can pick up the phone install

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,770
postmark device on it and expect to make

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,690
a call and have fun with it it's more

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,370
most advice or more in like a best way

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,660
by state if working Wi-Fi if we're

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,179
working screen and you can run some

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,679
interesting application it but don't

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,809
expect that you can make calls or

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,270
centers mess with it we do have a few

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,160
devices that's what you can make all

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,170
square for at least close to make all

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,000
space but most of them will not be the

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,610
case well boys market is based on Alpine

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,200
Linux it's

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,809
brought me mostly popular distro for

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,299
docker containers and on server

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,490
installations but will also work fine on

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,210
the laptops desktops and in our house

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,580
phones we chose alpine linux mainly

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,289
because it's really tiny the basis

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,059
Latian without the kernel that is it's

00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,129
only six megabytes big so that's

00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:11,539
basically a booting system once you add

00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:13,159
the kernel and because we work we chose

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,200
this because of size because we work

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,389
with a lot to change truth we every time

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,860
we do something we make a change to do

00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:21,919
some stuff in it we remove the chain

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,750
truth and that happens a lot and if you

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,610
do that like 6 times a day you don't

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,309
really want to wait every time the whole

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,259
in distribution is installed because our

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:31,970
system is only only the basis anyway

00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:34,370
it's only 6 megabytes big this is an

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,039
issue the change routes are made and

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:40,429
this inmates and remove the and inferior

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:44,029
within seconds and the development is

00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:46,700
quick because of it we are basically a

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,470
digital repository on top of LP Linux so

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,350
we use all the package from LP Linux and

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,629
although we have our own custom stuff

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,360
sometimes we do try to upstream as much

00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:58,460
as possible by Linux and where possible

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,500
also custom patches to the various

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:06,049
projects that are out there we are

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,990
like next OS basically we are interface

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:11,600
agnostic meaning we currently focusing

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,970
on plasma mobile but we also ship Foss

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,649
we had unity in the past unity ace and

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,440
we'll ship hopefully ship with it again

00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:20,899
in the future but we also ship with

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,330
Hilden from a molester and hopefully in

00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:26,419
the future also glacier UI and any other

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,039
your ID of my pop-up so we try to give

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,809
the choice to the user you can use our

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,450
system and it doesn't mean you have you

00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:36,559
have to be forced to one interface or

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,809
another like I said before don't expect

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,639
most of Isis to install it on the system

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,340
on and then expect it to call we are

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,950
basically in alpha state you can boot

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,559
the system you can mess around with it

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,259
have fun and except for a few devices

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,020
you probably won't use this phone in our

00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:59,390
case but the rest berry pie is also cool

00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,130
so you can use it like this we are we

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,940
have four channels on matrix and I see

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,980
please join when you feel free we need

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,110
both end users and developers we can use

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:17,000
all the help and hope to see you there

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:27,710
back to Moline thank you yeah I think so

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,790
okay definitely words right okay so I'm

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,340
gonna tell you a bit about what I've

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,660
been working on which is may Melissa I

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,040
hope I pronounce it correctly I'm not

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,990
from Finland and I've heard people

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,480
pronounce it differently me mo mo

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,300
I say me mo hope it doesn't offend

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,700
anyone it was developing Nokia a long

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,400
time ago Nokia was in the smartphone

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,470
business an internet about business

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,450
maybe even before Apple made their first

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,490
iPhone maybe it was around the same time

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,080
and they have been working on name off

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,610
for a while that they had various

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,830
internet tablets they had the N 770 n800

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,300
n810 those ro internet tablets you can

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,790
use them for navigation but they had no

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:09,429
cellular modem in there and then they

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:11,420
made the 100 that I still use today and

00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:14,870
they had a lot of people working on that

00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,460
OS and it was based on Debian and but I

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,160
don't mean that they literally use of

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,490
Debian repository but they used apt the

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,900
package manager to the package format

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,370
and a lot of the base system was the

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,700
same they actually sold a lot of devices

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,170
they sold I think a lot at least I think

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,820
it's a lot they saw a couple hundred

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:39,050
thousand Nokia n900 at least so a lot of

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,429
people who don't typically visit first

00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:46,340
time actually use that device probably

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:47,960
for a couple years and it's still being

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,220
maintained by the community there were

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,080
actually a lot of people using it was

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,390
kind of dubbed the hacker phone because

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,500
Nokia 900 had a radio transmitter and

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,000
receiver in there so you could put it in

00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,170
your car and it will transmit radio on

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,170
your car radio and you can just listen

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,760
to that and a lot a lot of cool features

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,960
and then community maintain it for a

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,269
long time but now there's not a level

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,679
not another a lot of me

00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,419
anymore but the cool thing is that they

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,749
still have a lot of packages on memo

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:15,609
that work with maps calculators useful

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:17,409
stuff okay and I'd be using it ever

00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,119
since as I said and the big problem is

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,589
that not everything in Maemo 5 which is

00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,109
the main what they made for the no kami

00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:26,429
100 is open source

00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:30,219
if it was a ship I think it would have

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,389
kept on living for a long time ever

00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:34,299
since they made it and not you know be

00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,559
in a hiatus data for a while and big

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:41,589
parts are not open source that's a

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:45,369
problem so I've covered some of it like

00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:46,539
why are we doing is I I love the OS and

00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,419
I still want to be able to use it that's

00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,909
a personal reason for me and this phone

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,129
100 is becoming very old so I need a new

00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,509
device on which I can run the same or

00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,679
similar software which actually gives me

00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,409
the newest class the next on my phone

00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,829
and I just wanted to be fully open

00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,299
source because this one is not so and

00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,489
it's been used by a lot of ordinary

00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,379
users the UI might look a little arcane

00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:10,149
at this point I also use screenshot

00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:12,429
later I think it's actually very usable

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:17,139
still but it doesn't look anything like

00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:18,940
iOS and Android now look look like and

00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:20,229
memo last is entirely community

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,089
community develop so over the years

00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:24,099
while the community members have worked

00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:26,169
and they've come and gone and there's

00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:27,999
currently three or four people actively

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,369
working on maimie lefse and we started

00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,529
about two years ago and there's a lot

00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,119
more people joining and testing and and

00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,909
fixing minor things but there's like

00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,239
three or four core developers so it's

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:41,200
not that many and I really like the fact

00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,879
that we're coming to develop because

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,649
there's no corporate backing and there's

00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:46,570
no special interest nobody wants to run

00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:48,190
their specific cloud in our device and

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,379
we're not pre installing any specific

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,820
cloud software or whatever and there's

00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,049
no specific direction that will take it

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,489
just because the company wants it or

00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:59,049
things that makes sense financially and

00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:00,519
it's compatible with this existing

00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:03,149
software so it's supposed to I think

00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:07,209
every single mobile this for you names

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:09,009
their own way line right and we are

00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:13,029
doing one that still uses x11 you can

00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:14,499
hate it or like it the code works in x11

00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,669
it was open-source there was no reason

00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,220
for us to make that work on we lent

00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:21,379
right now

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,909
and it uses a GT k23 + QD and there are

00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:24,740
some parts of the GDK but it's mostly

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,259
theming and some and some widgets but it

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,360
also means that if you want to run let's

00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:30,860
say something crazy libre office you can

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,360
just install it and it will actually

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,350
just start in device it probably won't

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,750
be very usable because there's all these

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,789
buttons and menus but it will look

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,169
stylish Li the dialogues will be styled

00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,179
and they kind of integrate in the system

00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:44,269
if you take more simple occasions

00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,830
they'll probably just run and I think

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:47,269
that's a big feat because if you were if

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,370
you base your work on top of Debian and

00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:53,000
and and and that one as I'll talk about

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,320
in a bit then there's 20,000 faculties

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,139
in repository that you can all just

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,090
install on use and some of them might be

00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:05,049
a bit clunky but they might also be very

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:08,350
good and everything we do is open-source

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,730
everything that we right now is GPL and

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,769
if there's some open-source license that

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,929
was not GPL before then we just run with

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:18,139
it if they puppy wrote something that

00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:20,539
was not a GPL another thing that really

00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:24,830
like is that the API is for memo are

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:26,480
developed with mobile in mind so they

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,309
thought about power management they

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,779
think about things like there's a

00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,639
participative sensors if you put

00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,840
something to your ear the screen needs

00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,679
to go off and the touch screen shouldn't

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,659
work anymore right because otherwise

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
you're pressing buttons or if you're in

00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:39,490
a darker room then the brightness should

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,320
adjust itself to the ambient level

00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,789
there's a compass in there if you flip

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,789
the phone it needs to go to portrait or

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,379
landscape mode that kind of stuff and

00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,269
all the api's are there so if we're

00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,240
working on making all this work we have

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,100
a fixed point we just followed what the

00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,440
API is that we re implement them and it

00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,600
all kinda just works it uses only like

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,009
80 megabytes hundred 50 megabytes is the

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,480
default I think on 64-bit devices and

00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:09,799
there's a lot of applications out there

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,049
that were community developed and if we

00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,370
keep the same API it's mostly then it's

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,539
just a matter of it compiling them and

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,490
they work so that's I think that's

00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:20,990
really cool and it allows us to keep

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,240
focus so what do we do we ported code

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,240
and we updated api's we looked at some

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,050
code programs that we're not open source

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,820
and we tried to figure out how they work

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,350
mad at them if they were then we looked

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,730
at the interfaces and we try to just

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:37,170
make that work and we build everything

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,950
in Jenkins so we have we have get

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,120
repositories currently on github and

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,470
Jenkins just builds whatever we commit

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,100
it built it for us and adds it back to

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,080
the Debian repository an installing memo

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,030
is as simple if you if you want to do it

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,710
you can just install Debian for that one

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,120
because we don't use systemd but

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,420
someone's working on system they support

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,160
if you really want it but you just add a

00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,480
single line and you install our meta

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,620
pockets and that's it it just works on

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,290
top of that way and I think that's I

00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,180
think that's really cool and our aim is

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,870
to make it work for people here at

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,680
fascism at for hackers for open-source

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,480
enthusiasts and not necessarily for the

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,300
end user will maybe get there but we're

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,610
not there now and real cool thing is

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,050
that I think somewhere mid last year we

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,930
submitted for funding for a new net

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,030
which is a nonprofit in the Netherlands

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,510
and we actually got 40,000 euros and

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:30,750
funding so we get to get pay for some of

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,910
the work we do this is what it looks

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,560
like on the n900 you can see that I was

00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,200
testing some Python bindings so the the

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,820
binary clock shows up there the actual

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,340
clock is not a binary clock I was just

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,650
testing a replacement clock applet it's

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,450
connected to the KP and network provider

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,650
in Netherlands on 3G the battery's full

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,820
it's on Wi-Fi before says the Wi-Fi

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,010
signals pretty strong it's currently

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,360
muted for sounds and it tells me there's

00:31:53,010 --> 00:32:01,830
that the application manager thinks

00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:02,400
there's an update available ok so what

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,760
do we have now

00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,670
it's that it's alpha quality at best if

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,990
you've got super excited I'm sorry once

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,460
it works and I can make phone calls I'm

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,260
gonna start using it as my main device

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,780
I'm gonna keep on dogfooding it and I

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,430
hope others who do the same right now it

00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,930
runs on the Nokia and then hundreds the

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,630
motor worlds wait for in the pine phone

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,810
I haven't mentioned the Motorola Droid 4

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,090
before it's made by Motorola and it's

00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,680
one of the last physical keyboard phones

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,110
they made so no Canon has a physical

00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,790
keyboard and that one does too and it

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,850
has a pretty good chip power management

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,560
wise and someone I think two people have

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,600
been working super actively on mainland

00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,520
support for years and now it actually

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,500
works really well

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,300
so the Wi-Fi works the modem or X power

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,550
management works you can get a couple

00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,179
days of power on that thing so I think

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,530
that's really cool and we use virtual

00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:54,080
machines for development so you can run

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,580
QM you VMware virtual box and you can

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,130
just have the desktop environment in

00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,480
your virtual machine login over

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,740
Association and do your development we

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
still need to get some core components

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,720
in place the main thing lacking I think

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,830
right now is a phone UI because we are

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,480
actually able to make some phone calls

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,309
using the command line but that's not

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,940
how you want to answer your phone or or

00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:18,530
make a phone call right I think it will

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,080
probably be a couple months honestly

00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,809
until we get to that point but I'm still

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,630
pretty excited and as I said before

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,880
there are demo devices and at the point

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:34,880
64 7 aw I think they'll be there until 5

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,650
so maybe very seeing them and I'm really

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,420
hoping that the power minds were really

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,160
good because you know k900 last for

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,890
maybe a week a week and a half if I

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,330
don't use it that much I don't I've

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,330
never seen that on an Android phone

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,670
so these are the devices we support and

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,230
there's a link up there with more

00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,760
devices that are not that well supported

00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,550
but they kind of work like I said we

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,140
reach out to folks in a couple and last

00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,760
but not least if you're really

00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,770
interested in power of VR which is the

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,920
3d driver on the Nokia 900 and the

00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,210
worldwide for the state was terrible and

00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,070
we've been working on it with other

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,440
people for a year and a half and now you

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,750
can patch mainline Linux a little bit

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,909
and it will start the users of space is

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,669
still closed source but text system is

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:20,690
actually building new binaries for us so

00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:25,040
it's actually looking pretty good leave

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:27,109
it apart that's a good Lucien as we

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,149
showed there are various UI is various

00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:33,530
distributions available basically every

00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:35,960
first choice is available impossible but

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,440
all of them do need work we need a lot

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,090
of help we nowadays we do have the vices

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,030
to run them on so please get a device

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,070
get into the first channels ask what you

00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,629
can do we don't just need developers we

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,879
also need end-users we need people to

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,149
write documentation and wait somewhere

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,220
everybody can do that

00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:56,960
hopefully this year

00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,210
probably first half-year maybe second

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,040
healthier expect songs to actually show

00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,960
up the pine foam will work the libra

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,300
five will by then work and hopefully

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,920
next year most people here will be able

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,010
to run such device and be able to come

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,690
up with it have fun with it

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,700
just make sure don't be don't be afraid

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,340
to ask questions we're all great people

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:20,060
we always appreciate a few help we can

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,890
get all the help we can get and we hope

00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:25,450
to see you in the various channels and

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:30,250
forums and all the places which we are

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,250
hope to welcome you into our community

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,760
lastly resources Quick Links may molesta

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,610
say fireball on free notes on RFC with

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,860
hashtag memo - Lester postmarked is

00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,930
available also free now with hashtag

00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,430
postmarked to us we're also all matrix

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,940
the gingerbread show doesn't matter

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:52,360
which you choose please join have a look

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,900
at our websites for more information and

00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,900
hope to see you next year

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:05,989
[Applause]

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,860
and if you're interested in more

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,300
technical details for me most

00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,830
specifically I did a talk a couple of

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,340
months ago in Bulgaria and open fest

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,470
which is another great open source event

00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,150
like this and it's about an hour long

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,010
the link is here I'll make sure that the

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,160
slides are on the FOSDEM website somehow

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:33,250
and it's more technical and in-depth and

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:33,250
in this talk it's up there any questions

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,230
little my father this bro he lost

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,760
with so many distributions being

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,590
available is there some plan to have

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,930
something like and everyone please leave

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,640
quietly or shuffle quietly it because I

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,980
can't hear please repeat with so many

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,170
distributions available here is it

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,580
possible that you can run say I don't

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,740
know if that'd make a snap on it to

00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,380
develop in the package for one of the

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,910
distributions of for all of them or do

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,390
you have to basically build an apk for

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,880
alpine adept with Airbnb based ones yeah

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,350
yeah so I guess the question is if with

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,240
so many distributions available do you

00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:18,250
want to package the app for all the

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,940
different distributions or can use snap

00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,030
or flat back

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,060
I guess yeah it depends a bit on the

00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,980
distribution most issues of data

00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,050
mentioned do support something like flat

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,940
pack a snap you can package them in flat

00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,970
half and both you can install and run

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,980
them on your device not all distribution

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,170
might necessarily support outdoors but

00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,520
often Ash's apt-get install flat pack

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,520
and it all work yeah

00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,369
yet

00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:58,239
okay okay are you working some all

00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:01,029
together with the Hollywood guys did you

00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,759
know I could not hear what you were

00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:08,319
saying please repeat you didn't hurt

00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:10,089
anything okay and so yeah are you

00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,049
working together with the helium guys to

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:16,259
get the stick or Android mobile phones

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,259
there's no

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,220
our young guys okay so the questions are

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,500
we working together with Allium I think

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,670
how them is using Android is a base and

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,590
it's like an abstraction around how a

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,170
Android to make things work better on

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,120
Android devices I think a lot of

00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,680
districts are but my mo is not because

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,870
we really want to focus on the main line

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,310
only and I don't want Android modem

00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,860
abstractions or graphics driver

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,270
obstructions or anything else like that

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,370
maybe people in the period you have done

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,980
it they've used it to make me more less

00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,330
to work on Android phones we might

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,810
support that in the future but right now

00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:01,560
we we don't we don't do that in case the

00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:03,810
first parts to us we have I think three

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,420
or four devices actually in luging using

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,950
hey Liam should I stay Piper's most of

00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,170
them tones but we definitely appreciate

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,060
effort if somebody ports hey Liam and

00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:19,250
our assistance with so yeah we should

00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:19,250
parties do we have more questions

00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:34,789
thank you if it was that for the choice

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:39,640
of the hardware for not plan for the

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:46,789
other one for present we only can choose

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:52,119
battery from the prime when door

00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:56,210
so you're locked in would set that we

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:59,029
changing the practice we sorry if you

00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:03,109
want to change the battery you want the

00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:09,950
best we get then damaged and want to

00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:19,910
change in with the prison you can't buy

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:21,950
a bundle you have talked about changing

00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,089
batteries yes so that's the pencil

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,519
device on the other hundred you can

00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:27,349
change batteries about problem the point

00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,029
phone uses the standard Samson battery

00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,470
so you can just buy those start

00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,329
batteries and replace the battery in

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,819
your pint phone I'm not sure if you can

00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,960
replace it while the device is on you

00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:38,150
could do that with some devices to view

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:43,160
power them over USB swap out the battery

00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:45,430
that kind of stuff that can work I can

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,430
tell you

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,690
on the written smart-aleck can't buy

00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:01,530
from another window the battery in was

00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,900
said with the hardware yeah

00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,550
the main problem with batteries is I

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,290
guess the voltage and the size of the

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,660
battery most phones even though

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,100
manufactures say you should not replace

00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,560
the battery you can just get any other

00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,140
and the world work fine if we take the

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,270
pine phone and the they basically

00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,760
already set from the store they do

00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,100
support replacing battery you can get I

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,020
think a guy cj7 battery and the world

00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,480
work fine and fine phone in case of lead

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,580
from five I think they used custom form

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,100
factor so field it bit hearts but the

00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,170
device itself is not a reason there's no

00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,880
hardware limitations on the battery it's

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,720
just a form factor and if the voltage is

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,720
good should be fine

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:52,390
what's the policy for binary blobs in

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,970
post-market OS what's the policy for

00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:59,560
binary blobs in post-market OS do you

00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:04,360
really care about them the question is a

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,320
fish we care about binary blobs yeah we

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,350
prefer not to

00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,480
of course when in some case some binary

00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,810
blobs or at least firmware is needed to

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,430
get the device running we do ship at

00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:20,590
least propriety firmware when possible

00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,540
but there are some efforts to replace a

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,130
proprietary firmware provider blas with

00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,350
open-source variants we try to use it

00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,210
wherever possible for example the the

00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,400
mali chip you in a fine phone and has

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,970
binary blobs but we try to use Meza and

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,680
says that doesn't mean if it's actually

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,630
needed to get the device running yeah we

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:44,080
certainly we have to what do we do

00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:46,560
packages now ok thanks any more

00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,560
questions

00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:10,040
I have a question about my molest them

00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:16,369
does it support the old boot is original

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:21,230
and 900 thermal deal hood is original

00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:23,450
software currently we haven't made it

00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,790
work with the other software that's on

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,770
the old and 100 like if you for example

00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:31,130
take their binaries you just want to run

00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,720
it on a molester right it doesn't work

00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,430
I've tried it a couple times some simple

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,359
binaries work with other things start to

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:41,930
go very wrong it uses a different API it

00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,310
uses its army l-not arm heart float so

00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,220
the floating-point stuffs different that

00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,390
can still sometimes work I think if you

00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,220
try hard enough you might be able to

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,960
make it work but we haven't tried that

00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,960
hard silky

00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:06,410
do we have any more questions thank you

00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:14,820
very much

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:14,820
