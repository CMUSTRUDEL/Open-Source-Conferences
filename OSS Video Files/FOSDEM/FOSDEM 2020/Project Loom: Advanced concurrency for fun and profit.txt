Project Loom, an OpenJDK project, is "intended to explore, incubate and deliver Java VM features and APIs built on top of them for the purpose of supporting easy-to-use, high-throughput lightweight concurrency and new programming models on the Java platform."  These feature include Lightweight Threads, delimited continuations, and tail-call elimination.


The speaker, a Project Loom team member, will describe the project in depth, in particular the gnarly details of how coroutine and continuation scheduling mechanism works, and a new feature, Scoped Locals.
