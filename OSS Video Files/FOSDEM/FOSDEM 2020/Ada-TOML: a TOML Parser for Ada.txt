The world of generic structured data formats is full of contenders:
the mighty XML, the swift JSON, the awesome YAML, ...  Alas, there
is no silver bullet: XML is very verbose, JSON is not convenient for
humans to write, YAML is known to be hard to parse, and so on.


TOML is yet another format whose goal is to be a good configuration
language: obvious semantics, convenient to write and easy to parse
in general-purpose programming languages.


In this talk, I'll shortly describe the TOML format and show a few
use cases in the real world.  I'll then present the ada-toml library
itself: its high-level architecture and examples.
