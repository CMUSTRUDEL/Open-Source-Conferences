LibreOffice is free and open source office suite software that is very popular today. LibreOffice is almost used in various user segments, ranging from personal, community, education, and even companies. It would be very interesting to be able to have LibreOffice specific themes for each segment. For this reason, we (LibreOffice Indonesia Community) took the initiative to create a special extension to manage themes in LibreOffice, we call it LO-TC (read: Lotis) LibreOffice Theme Changer.
LibreOffice is free and open source office suite software that is very popular today. LibreOffice is almost used in various user segments, ranging from personal, community, education, and even companies. It would be very interesting to be able to have LibreOffice specific themes for each segment. This of course will also further strengthen the fact LibreOffice is truly free software.
Unfortunately, the features to set themes in LibreOffice are currently limited. As of now, LibreOffice only provides 6 theme choices for users. In the previous version, although there were many bug and problems, there was a persona theme menu that was quite interesting to me. For this reason, I and my friends in the LibreOffice Indonesia Community took the initiative to create a special extension to manage themes in LibreOffice, we call it LO-TC (read: Lotis) LibreOffice Theme Changer.
LO-TC was originally just a simple bash script that allows users to change some visual components in LibreOffice, some of which are:


❮pre❯❮code❯• Images in headers and footers
• Intro or splash screen
• Colors in the application, and
• Icons (optional)
❮/code❯❮/pre❯

Because it is only based on bash scripts, LO-TC can only be used for Linux and Mac (with a few adjustments). Because of this limitation, we finally decided to rewrite LO-TC in the form of extensions so that it could later be used on many operating systems.
The various LibreOffice installation models (via repositories of distributions, snap, flatpak, etc.) pose quite daunting challenges for developers. In addition, this is our first extension project, so we need a lot of new things that we must understand in the process of working on this latest LO-TC. Current status of LO-TC development can be found here: https://github.com/libreofficeid/LO-TC-GUI
