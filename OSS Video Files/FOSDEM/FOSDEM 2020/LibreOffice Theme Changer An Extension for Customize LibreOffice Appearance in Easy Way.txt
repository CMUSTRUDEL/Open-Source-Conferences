LibreOffice is free and open source office suite software that is very popular today. LibreOffice is almost used in various user segments, ranging from personal, community, education, and even companies. It would be very interesting to be able to have LibreOffice specific themes for each segment. For this reason, we (LibreOffice Indonesia Community) took the initiative to create a special extension to manage themes in LibreOffice, we call it LO-TC (read: Lotis) LibreOffice Theme Changer.
LibreOffice is free and open source office suite software that is very popular today. LibreOffice is almost used in various user segments, ranging from personal, community, education, and even companies. It would be very interesting to be able to have LibreOffice specific themes for each segment. This of course will also further strengthen the fact LibreOffice is truly free software.
Unfortunately, the features to set themes in LibreOffice are currently limited. As of now, LibreOffice only provides 6 theme choices for users. In the previous version, although there were many bug and problems, there was a persona theme menu that was quite interesting to me. For this reason, I and my friends in the LibreOffice Indonesia Community took the initiative to create a special extension to manage themes in LibreOffice, we call it LO-TC (read: Lotis) LibreOffice Theme Changer.
LO-TC was originally just a simple bash script that allows users to change some visual components in LibreOffice, some of which are:


❮pre❯❮code❯• Images in headers and footers
• Intro or splash screen
• Colors in the application, and
• Icons (optional)
❮/code❯❮/pre❯

Because it is only based on bash scripts, LO-TC can only be used for Linux and Mac (with a few adjustments). Because of this limitation, we finally decided to rewrite LO-TC in the form of extensions so that it could later be used on many operating systems.
The various LibreOffice installation models (via repositories of distributions, snap, flatpak, etc.) pose quite daunting challenges for developers. In addition, this is our first extension project, so we need a lot of new things that we must understand in the process of working on this latest LO-TC. Current status of LO-TC development can be found here: https://github.com/libreofficeid/LO-TC-GUI

indonesia and for this project i am the

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
leader and manager of the graphic

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
libraries time changer project

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
you can call me you can contact me if

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,479
you need

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:15,040
okay let me start what

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,080
engine of is uh i wanna

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,119
i wanna ask to you all please raise

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,840
raise your hand if you care about a pair

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,360
of applications so

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,080
we it appearance of application is

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
better

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,880
right okay we agree because of that

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,159
uh for uh we we should hike like

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,000
that libraries has a

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,799
best best performance but

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
sometimes uh for example in my country

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,960
the graphics

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,920
look like oh it's too old

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,720
to hold style for example and they will

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
compare to

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
other office with application it's

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,880
happened to your country

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,399
yeah yeah or never yeah

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,319
we will go to that moment

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,520
okay i will explain first

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,040
this is as i said it's an extension

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
for libreoffice will allow you to

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,319
personalize the broker's appearance

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
include splice when you open the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
breakfast then

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,640
with a fair image yeah express or

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,680
in depth in developer it's intro

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,760
yeah intro image then persona

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
if you use firefox you will be very

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,480
familiar with persona 10

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
and it you can

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
and you also can change the icon

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
or the light up menu so you can make

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
your regular office

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,800
with your own style but it's very

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
complicated if you do it manually

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
so that uh libreoffice mechanism

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
completely makes

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
extension that will help you to the to

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
do

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,319
that easily you can go to the

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,680
repository to what's uh

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,040
our progress and now you can try it

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,280
but i i i shall told you that

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
this very clearly development and there

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
are some

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,040
problem and some issue that we

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,640
will solve in next time

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,680
is the appearance of ltc my

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
window and in the last i will show you

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,480
how to use

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,640
this extension this actually goes with

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,760
python 3.5 uh then we graph this macro

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
to break uh stl ui dialog

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,959
so we use layer graphics to graph the ui

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
and

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,519
we convert from hdl file to

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,560
the py file which

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,920
united anyone ever know

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
but united yes actually our team also

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,879
know

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,720
yes we can convert this to this uh

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,920
okay next how eltc work

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,959
i will explain the basic uh

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,599
the basic of the uh the theory

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
first i'll using the backup the mind

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,359
file

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
for example intro personas and

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,560
then we will create a simile

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,160
so wait wait simply because

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,840
some file or some image asset is on

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,560
root directory so we when we

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,280
wanna change it we will need a root

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
password

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,440
and it's very annoying if you wanna just

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,360
check one thing to other than you need

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,800
enter the password it's annoying so we

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
can make assembling

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,120
and set the assembly into

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,160
a configuration directory of libraries

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
in home

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,360
then we will can change it easily

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
without

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,120
but again okay uh for complete

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,800
upload you can refer to this document

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,080
documentation there are some powerful

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
because play graphics are run in several

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
operating system

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,520
linux then windows metro s

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,960
so we have a different treatment for

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,919
lotc especially especially linux

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,000
we have some methods to install like

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,400
using jeff or rpm

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,080
then flat pack snap

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
all of them use different territory and

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,680
different pack

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
so we push off like a different

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,479
treatment

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,759
when we use a lpc extension

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,280
yes of course you can run

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,800
our otc in our operating system

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,800
start from linux windows max

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,039
then uh to make iotc more simple

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,960
we make a bundle of thing

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:10,639
we call we call it the otc time

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,639
so this file is contain

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,360
image and configuration about

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
about the persona about the intro and i

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
will show

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,680
the show you and we also make

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,120
complete documentation how to make a

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,479
lotc file or

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,520
time bundle uh and you can write it

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,960
in dots with dot library dot id slice

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,240
your browser

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,319
time changer slice otc i

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
i have write the complete documentation

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,600
step by step

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,759
how to buy how to build and then how to

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,000
write a new term just like that

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
then the question is why ltc is

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,919
important

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,039
uh as you answer the first

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
because the parent is matter for me for

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
example

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,080
yeah sometimes i wanna have an

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,440
application that

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,720
yes this certification is me

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,319
i wanna show to everyone i usually brand

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
rich and it's freedom

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
what's real freedom yes because i can

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
change everything

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
in every office and you can do that in

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,759
other offices

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,800
that's one example but the first

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,160
is it is a promotion strategy

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,840
why with otc we can go to

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,199
office uh school and other community

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,720
then we can make a broad office

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,840
like uh or some rebrand rebrand

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
uh yes libra you can use your

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
company logo or your school logo in a

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,639
library office

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,199
it's very easy and you can

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
share it to your student just because we

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,759
have our otc file

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,879
so then you can send to each other

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,280
then we will can combine

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:13,840
the libraries explicitly more widely

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,840
i think the example yes this is

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
symbol in asia especially in russia this

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,039
means

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,440
a strong and brief woman so we dedicate

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,560
the

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,760
distance for uh libreoffice

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,959
libraries in indonesia so we can

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,839
say to ladies yeah you should usually

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,039
drop this way

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,599
because it's yours ladies can use this

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
thing

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,480
and we also create special item time for

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,519
graphics named also srikanji

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,720
then we also

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,399
make custom time for library kids

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,240
right yeah you know that i have a little

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,200
little brother when uh

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,920
my brother i wanna try to type in

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,560
something

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,360
they designate complex menu they only

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
need

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
some of manual libreoffice then

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
libreoffice is variable

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,200
to selected but which menu that you need

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
on ah it's it's too complicated for

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,920
children okay

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,040
we can skip it so yes we are

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,080
for libra kids yeah

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,680
we also create simple items

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,800
for kids never hits i can style

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,959
and then we also create

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,399
uh something for for example

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,160
anybody know about this musket rider

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,839
you know it's very popular in japan and

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,200
indonesia

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,240
superhero and then we have a community

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
about this

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
for example that is joined at the

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,880
community we can make

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
we can serve or we can tell yes you you

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
can use sleep rocks because

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:11,440
we have special tempo libraries yes we

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:15,120
call the camera apk with the icon i use

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,360
a default icon for kve brief and

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,519
icon we used to take time

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,120
for more time we have we can we

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,560
have clipped some 10 uh

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
you know pikachu yeah we also had

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,279
10 pikachu where you can trade and

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,560
operate in lu blue the clip graphics

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,279
that i read last favor

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
then as i said before this is freedom

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,680
evidence

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,760
so we can tell easily the library

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,800
libraries is freedom

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,680
yeah this example you can make

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
libreoffice

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,959
as your style with your with your own

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,720
style

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,480
and i believe that every country every

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,000
culture have their unique style

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,839
and we can integrate the counter

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,200
into libraries i think it's interesting

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,399
then increase people in price

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,519
for example i have a friend and then i

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,640
teach him how to make item time

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,920
without otc then

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,360
oh i suddenly whoa

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
he met something yeah he's a strange

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
strange moment

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,079
when he make a presentation in the in

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,200
front of the class

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,800
he used intro with his photo

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,000
like this in the intro so when

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,839
he open odp file double click click

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,360
and the screen appear this photo

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,399
so it's microsoft

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,680
no it's libreoffice really you can

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
make it we can check it just because

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
it's

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,720
very very freaking and you can use

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,480
freely

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,720
uh yes uh okay the next is

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,760
as i said the brush which is still under

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
development

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,240
our team has do the best as we can

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,920
to make ltc better in the future yes the

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,040
tower of economic issues

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,480
is operating in github issue

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,519
and this is yeah

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,040

run well in

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,000
linux so it can run in

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,560
windows link windows or mac then

frame throw me when you do not make an

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
extension huh

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,920
extension i don't think about extension

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,880
and yes lltc is my first extension

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:35,839
project for my graphics

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,839
so thank you frank because

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:52,000

add your image and configuration there

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,320
to change the

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:58,560
thing you just need to click for example

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,759
okay then activate

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,600
writing okay

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,839
okay the icon change let's

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
go while it's too big

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
uh

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
for maximum appearance you can change

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
you can go through the

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
option

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,639
yeah then you can uh

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
choose here but if you activate the

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,199
thing here

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,839
uh the intro and i can change will not

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,160
change but you can

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,920
change the figure application as you see

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,120
the background is to contrast

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,680
so you can choose the color that

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,920
compatible with 10 color here

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,920
feel

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,480
more yeah

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,240
okay and for better

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,720
i think i want to move

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,720
no better for me and for child

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,360
kids i activate the thing

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:38,400
okay then i close

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
and to see

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,200
that i can change

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,320
interface uh i don't show

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
but i think not because we we love

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
default interface

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,679
that is the questions from yeah you know

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,120
is to

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,120
earn to close with others but we love

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,960
temporary breakfast because it's cool

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,240
you can for example

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,679
in your tank you can you can

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,000
move each panel like this but in default

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,400
we free to choose which file position

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,520
and which the icon that you need to show

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,850
or not

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,799
yes like that

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:39,919
[Music]

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,520
yeah just for icon

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,000
and icon but for persona i have tried

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,880
but

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:57,370
it's not working yeah working but not

00:18:46,880 --> 00:19:08,320
not too good

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:11,440
[Music]

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
okay any questions

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,600
and the extension actually bypass the

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:27,280
options various often put many things

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,280
into one whole thing here which is great

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,120
right now this

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,799
appearance of toolbar which

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,320
is done by a so-called persona

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,440
and firefox changes

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,880
frequently the api that means they

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,880
kind of decided to go away from the bay

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,799
and i learned maybe

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
i learned that it starts and can be

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
tweaked

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,679
as well close yeah

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,039
you have on the left hand the bar

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,799
in the middle part are switches

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,320
in the configuration to apply different

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,280
colors

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,000
and i believe you can also change the

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,840
background

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,840
image of the left side for exercises

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,120
how to do that because early graphics

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
have

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,559
got xcu file which means it's

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
a configuration file for every office

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,799
but

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,679
we don't know where is the documentation

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,200
for

00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,320
this file and we just try to understand

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,520
step by step so yes we want

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,760
one of my ltc more grip and

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,039
more simple so you just click and

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,360
everything change

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:17,840
but yeah we will do it step by step

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,840
like this

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
to change the color of the cycle

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,080
depending on the system

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
yeah so i figured out how it works and

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,919
that

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,960
there is a switch and the topic is still

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,960
open and we may change it

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,369
[Music]

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,960
we use protect mode with for example

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,880
google 10

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,640
but also common uh muscular trailer

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,679
superheroes that i create

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,400
is for that time but

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,720
yeah we still should change the

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,919
application button manually

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,760
so for the personalized data

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,039
we should only need to change the

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
pattern to

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,120
get that mod for libreoffice and it's

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,400
possible

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,760
and yeah for multiples they are

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,240
performance one attempt but in 6.2

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,039
if the picture is gone and sent to only

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,480
16 where the input by default in

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,600
libraries that

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,320
one of the motivations are solid block

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,760
is support

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,159
to add something but with different way

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,720
and we use this different way to make

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
our tc

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,880
okay how do you have plans to

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
for example uh

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,440
bring this extension to
