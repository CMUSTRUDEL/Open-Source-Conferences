We have seen several licenses proposed as "open source" that
carry some obligation or restriction related to ethics or
other social goals. Is this a good direction for FOSS license drafting?
Affirmative position: FOSS licenses should advance social goals

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,720
all right let's get started with the

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,440
next debate which is

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,320
should licenses be designed to advance

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,839
general social goals we have

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
john sullivan molly de blanc james

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,680
mazziel josh simmons pedestrino

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,480
so i will uh

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
give the mic to

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
john sullivan who's going to start

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
fabulous

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
all right but i have a mic right i

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
haven't like it's working is this

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
working

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,569
[Music]

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,840
i would hand it to you but it will burn

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
me if i touch it

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
let me get my timer

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
yeah literally

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
hello everybody i'm john sullivan the

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
executive director and vice president of

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,159
the free

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
software foundation uh but like the

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,360
slide says

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
what i'm saying here has no relation to

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
what i actually think

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,040
individually or what the fsf thinks i

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
want to say that in the november issue

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
of the fsf bulletin newsletter i

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
actually wrote an article

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
that starts to try and address some of

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
these topics so if you're looking for

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,479
what i actually think

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,920
that's a that's a good place to look but

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
i very much appreciate this debate

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
format

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
i think it helps me understand other

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,479
people's feelings perspectives

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,479
and positions a lot better it helps me

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
determine my own positions

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
and helps improve my critical thinking

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
and believe me that needs a lot of

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
improvement

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
um so with all that in mind molly dash

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
and

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,879
i stand resolved that yes licenses

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
should be designed to advance

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,080
general social goals

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
we're discussing this topic because

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,040
there have been multiple new licenses

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
written

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
which are largely in the spirit of free

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,360
software and that they allow

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
much more sharing modification and use

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
than typical default copyright law

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
allows

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,480
but they also include provisions seeking

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
to prevent certain harms to society the

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
environment

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
humanity and we're not here to

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
necessarily defend any of the particular

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
licenses or even

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
the idea that the best approach is to

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,800
tackle these problems through individual

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
separate licenses

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
but i want to run down some quick

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
examples of some of the recent ones and

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
the harms that they're seeking to

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
address

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
kind of set the stage for what we're

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
talking about

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
so we have the problem of climate change

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
which as we know will end the planet

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
unless we do something

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
citation needed but sure but look at the

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
weather outside at fosdem that's not

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,040
right

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
we all know it um the atmosphere license

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
that lewis mentioned seeks to address

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
this

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
by requiring you to divest certain kinds

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,959
of

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,239
investments and fossil fuels if you want

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
to use the software

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,640
the precondition second of all we have

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
labor exploitation

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,800
the anti-996 license which is immensely

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
popular i think it's the number two

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
starred project on github right now

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
um says you cannot use the software

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
unless you comply with good labor

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
standards which do not include forcing

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
your employees to work 9 a.m to 9 p.m

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
six days a week

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,599
licenses are supposed to ensure that

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
people have

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
freedom while using the software but can

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,879
we really say that people

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,760
being forced to work 72 hours a week

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,319
have the freedom necessary to have the

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,519
freedom

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,120
to modify uh share distributed software

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
as compared to the people who have power

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
over them who can in fact use that

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
software

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
um to enhance their exploitation over

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
the people they already had some amount

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,439
of control over

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
we have vaccines uh we have infectious

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
diseases we know they have caused

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
you know massive amount of death over

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
history that's that that's why we have

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
vaccines and

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
and why people take them people refusing

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
to take vaccines

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
uh cause other people put other people

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,680
at risk of dying the vaccine

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
license says you have to get vaccinated

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
and make sure that everybody under your

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,320
legal control also gets vaccinated

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
before you can use the software

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
the final example i have is

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,520
militarization that militaries

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
and police departments are actually

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,320
using free software

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
to violate other people's rights and

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,520
kill them that's not good

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
so various licenses seek to forbid that

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,199
specific use

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,160
of the software or distribution to

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479
entities

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
known to engage in that kind of uh

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,600
activity

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
we need we need to be reasonably we need

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
to be alive and we need to be reasonably

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,919
healthy

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,360
in order to have any kind of meaningful

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
freedom when we're interacting with

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
software if we're dead we don't have

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
software freedom

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
uh nor if we're melting or you know

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
drowning from sea level rise

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,199
we also need to be free in other ways in

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,320
order to be able to exercise our

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
software freedom

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
and we inherited militaries and we need

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
our police forces to behave ethically in

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
order to have a democratic society to

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,759
begin with

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
so what we're seeing with these licenses

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
is that

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
you know first of all they use the law

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
to prevent

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,800
uh the software from being used directly

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
for bad things

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
and second of all they're doing things

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
to create incentives or leverage to

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,639
discourage bad behavior and encourage

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
good behavior you can't use the software

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
unless you

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
act in a certain way which is beneficial

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
to society

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
and important for avoiding really

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
catastrophic kinds of harm

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,759
and yes there are other ways to address

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
these problems there are laws

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
uh there's economic incentives are

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
purchasing power boycotts things like

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
that

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
but just because there are other tools

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,520
doesn't mean we shouldn't use all the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
tools that we have available

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
especially when the consequences are so

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
extreme

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
and especially because we can use

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
multiple things in parallel they don't

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
compete with each other

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
and in fact people are turning to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
software licenses

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,600
because other kinds of tools are not

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
working or are not working fast enough

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
and software licenses are something that

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
individuals have very direct control

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
over and also make a very clear

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
statement if you decide not to buy

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
mcdonald's does not know that i do not

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
eat at mcdonald's i promise you

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
that is not sending them any kind of

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
message but if i put their name and a

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
software license and they see that then

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,639
they know exactly what kind of behavior

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
you know i or another developer is

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
objecting to

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,039
um and let's remember also the companies

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
aren't people they don't have individual

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
rights

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
uh because they don't have the

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,600
accountability that comes with an

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
individual rights either

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
and also even when it comes to

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
individuals we accept certain kinds of

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
restrictions on our freedom

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
and the interest of private in the

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
interest of safety and security you

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
can't shout fire in a crowded theater

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and you can't use my software to destroy

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
the planet

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
these licenses indicate that people are

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,560
very interested in the ethics

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,400
of technology and software things that

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
are you know at the heart of free

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
software

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
so to tell these new ethical hector

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,599
hackers to get off our lawn and go read

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
do that org philosophy is uh not gonna

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
help

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
we should encourage their participation

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
even if we think that it might be

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
imperfect

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,960
and you know maybe if we listen instead

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,720
of talk

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
uh then if we're welcoming these social

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
goal licenses end up being a stepping

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,759
stone

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
towards traditional free licenses like

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
some people

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
argue that creative commons

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
non-commercial licenses are a way to get

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,639
people more accustomed to the idea of

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
sharing their work more and then

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,360
eventually they become more comfortable

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,360
enough to use fully free licenses

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
and you know sure there might be some

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
problems with this approach the negative

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
team will tell us all about them

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,080
but i don't think these problems will be

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
world ending or

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
threatening the planet on a global scale

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
and i think the problems that we're

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,000
talking about actually are

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:57,980
so we better try harder and we should

00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,279
use licenses to do it

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,279
[Applause]

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,759
okay all very very persuasive

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
the first question that i that i have

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,720
for you uh draws on a question that came

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
up a little earlier in the previous

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
discussion

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,840
which is uh how do we handle

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,159
shifting norms around ethics

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
because sometimes ethics shift in a

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
positive direction sometimes they

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,240
regress

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,159
and that depends on where you are in the

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
world as well

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,800
if we are to codify ethics and

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
a license um

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
how do we how do we make room for the

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
fact that those things are going to

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
drift over time

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
yeah i think that's a fair question but

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,519
i don't think it's that much different

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
from how we

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
deal with that in our laws you know and

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,560
i think that licenses in fact are

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,320
are more flexible than many other kinds

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
of instruments that try to

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
address ethical questions you know

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
religious texts foundational

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
philosophical texts

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
statutes these things all have to be

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
revisited and

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
i think that we've had the benefit of

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
living with software licenses free

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000
software licenses that have had

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,519
great staying power and been around for

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
a long time but it doesn't necessarily

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
have to be that way

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
we could put out a new edition of gpl

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
over here

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
that sounds very representative

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,000
along those same lines how do we if

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,800
if we are to make room for advancing

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
general social goals through licenses

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,640
how do we prevent uh regressive

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
ethics uh from from entering those

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,959
licenses

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,839
so what do you mean by regression so

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
at the license that may be uh given the

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
culture that it's created in might

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
restrict uh reproductive autonomy for

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
instance

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
well i think that's kind of similar to

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
the first question and that you know

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
ethics are

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
their territory for disagreement and we

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,480
have to have ways to

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,680
you know have conversations about that

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,519
and

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,120
on one hand you know licenses there's

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
other people will not use them unless

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
they agree with the stances that are

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
taken there so there's kind of the basic

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
democracy aspect and then maybe we have

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,279
bodies that are responsible for

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
you know that are end up being trusted

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,320
for making decisions about which kinds

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
of provisions are acceptable and

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
licenses licenses

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,560
and which aren't and the conversations

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,920
can happen under their umbrella

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,560
so lastly as we pursue more

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,959
ethical technology and more just world

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,200
which are all lotable goals

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
how do we uh work against how do we

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
weigh against the unintended

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
consequences

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
knowing that there are projects that are

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
built on the foundations of the four

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
freedoms and the open source definition

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
today

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,399
that are making a dent in these problems

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,600
how do we how do we know

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,800
that uh adding ethics to the licenses

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
will not uh adversely

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,480
detract from those efforts that already

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
exist

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
um well we have to i mean that's kind of

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
the question about keeping them up to

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:29,519
date and revising them

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:31,990
i think thanks i'm so glad to hear that

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,240
we're ready for gplv4 i have some ideas

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,800
[Laughter]

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
seven minutes

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
so it has become uh fashionable to start

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,120
this talk with a disclaimer

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
that you i don't really believe any of

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,800
the things i'm about to say

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
i barely mean these words as they come

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
out of my mouth you cannot hold me to

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
them

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
at any point in time so we've had a lot

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,519
of

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
community discussion over the last few

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
months

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,880
around this question of what is the role

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,440
of ethics in licenses

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
what is the right place to locate ethics

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
in our community

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,560
and nobody up here and probably nobody

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
in the audience thinks that there is a

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
reason why we should not have any ethics

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
at all in the work that we do

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
and the question really today is just

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
why would we put them in licenses or why

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,800
wouldn't we put them in licenses

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,320
and our position on this side of the

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
stage

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,360
is that the licenses are the wrong place

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
to put

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
the ethics because there are better

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
places

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
and putting the ethics in the licenses

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
makes your job

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
harder not easier it's not only less

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
effective than some of these other ways

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,320
of going about it

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
it's ineffective so let me talk about

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
that a little bit right

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
we have all of these licenses right i

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,639
know people in this room

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,200
really care about licenses but i don't

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,440
give a about licenses

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
i think licenses are kind of stupid i've

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
spent a lot of time thinking about them

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,240
i spent a lot of time working on them

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,279
and i regret every second of it

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,839
i have wasted years of my life

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
thinking about the least consequential

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
end

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
of the free and open source software

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
world

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
right the the magic in the freedom we

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
get

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
is not in the freedom it's what we do

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
with it it's in the collaboration that

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,839
we have

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
it's in the people we meet we talk to we

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,360
work with

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
we get to do things together that are

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,760
greater than what we could ever do alone

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,880
and it's not because of licenses

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,600
we don't really use the licenses

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,959
half an hour ago people tried to recite

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
the four freedoms the people on the

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,720
stage tried to recite the four freedoms

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,519
it was a lot of

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,360
i don't know if i can count that high i

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,760
can't recite the four freedoms

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
i don't know what they are i've read the

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
licenses

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
every time i have a question about them

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
i have to go back to them who here has

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
actually

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:03,839
read gplv3 all the way through liars

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
lawyers all of you put your hands down

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,920
even if you did read it i bet you just

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
skimmed it

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,800
and i bet you didn't even understand it

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,600
because it's not written to be

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
comprehensible

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
right

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,399
we have these licenses they're like

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
flags that we wave

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,839
we point at them we think they we all

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
think we know what they mean but they

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
each mean a different thing

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
to each of us we have no common

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,519
understanding of what they mean because

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
we never test the damn things

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
we never take them to court we never

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,519
litigate them right even when we do

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
it's a quagmire that we just want to get

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,040
out of as soon as we get in

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,079
sorry bradley the whole point of the

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
license is

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,440
when we get involved in them is not that

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
we're going to use them to change the

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
world to make everything better

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
the point of the licenses is to have a

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,440
common point around which we can gather

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
and start working together and what

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
truly controls the behavior

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
of the people around the licenses is the

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
norms in the communities that cohere

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
around them

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
when we get together we decide in this

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,399
project the gpl means x

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,040
in that project the gpl means why

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,399
and they're different things right

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
people disagree about what these

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
licenses mean and that's okay

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,920
because in each community where you want

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,480
to participate

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,320
you adopt the local definition you adopt

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
the local norms about all kinds of

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
things

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,040
both what's in the license and what's

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
not right the the codes of standards of

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,279
behavior

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
the way people are going to interact

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,639
with each other just the method of

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,839
getting a pull request into a project

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,079
those are all norms that aren't in the

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,959
license

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
we enforce those norms by saying if you

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
want to come play with our community

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,079
if you want to access the value the

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
magic of the collaboration

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
if you want to be here with us you have

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
to behave in a certain way

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,680
the licenses are not what makes that

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
happen it's the community that makes

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,120
that happen

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
if you want to enforce ethical norms and

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
standards of behavior around your

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
software

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
the answer is to build strong

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
communities where there is so much value

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
in participating in that community as a

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,959
first class participant

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,680
that you are going to collaborate

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,000
alongside with those norms

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
that is how we have always done license

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
enforcement

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
that is how we have always done

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,240
community enforcement around codes of

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,199
conduct and behavior and

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
ethics in all sorts of ways that have

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,600
that have preceded

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,600
the current set of conversations so that

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
is what we are standing for on this side

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
of the stage is just that notion

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
that if you want to do licenses you have

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,440
to ground it

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
in your community we don't enforce the

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
licenses we don't actually use that text

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
for anything

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
nobody understands what that text is and

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,680
so we all end up falling back

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
to this notion of community and it's not

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,360
perfect right there's always going to be

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,199
places where that's going to end where

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,399
your community does not have

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,639
the power and the control

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,920
but the same is true of the licenses

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,279
right most of the time when there's

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,360
license violations

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
nothing ever gets done about it the vast

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,959
majority

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
of software that doesn't comply with the

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,000
licenses

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,360
we just let it go because the cost of

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,120
fighting is so high

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,280
because the cost of collaboration is so

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,919
low

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,480
and so we end up at a place where if you

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,319
want

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
ethical enforcement putting it in the

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
license is pointless

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,760
unless you have the community behind you

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,280
putting it in the license is pointless

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
unless you have a strong community that

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,880
is worth participating in

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
so why put it in the license what do you

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
get out of it

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
if you get nothing out of it what does

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,520
it cost you it costs you

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
the rigidity of being stuck with a bunch

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
of license terms

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,520
that might meet the needs of your

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,799
community today but might not tomorrow

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,400
right when we were working on gpl v3

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
linus famously said that he couldn't

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
adopt it even if he wanted to

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,960
now i think he didn't really want to but

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
the point is that he had this large

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
community of people behind him

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
and getting all of them to sign off and

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,400
moving to v3 was a non-starter

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
if v2 had included a bunch of ethical

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
clauses that were no longer relevant to

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
his community

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,120
he stuck with them right so that's the

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,160
problem with licenses

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
they're rigid they're friction once you

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
start trying to enforce them you're

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,000
talking to lawyers

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
who are not doing you any favors they're

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
just getting in the way

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
of actually getting people talking

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
directly to each other which is where

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,520
the community conversation needs to

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
happen thank you

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,840
given that i would given that i was name

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
checked i would love to do the cross but

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
i am just the moderator i believe daesh

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
from the affirmative side will be doing

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
the cross

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,880
thank you bradley um oh am i still up

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
yes yes thank you james so question you

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,919
james are all users of open source

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,919
software ethical

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
yes yes they are all users of open

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,799
source exxon

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
for instance i mean in their use of free

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
software if they're complying with the

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,559
license i think they're doing

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
they're they're meeting their ethical

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,480
obligations comprehensive ethical

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
obligations

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,400
like beyond the license yeah oh no the

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,799
license goes as far as

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
you know what the license covers and is

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,039
climate change a good thing

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,280
no definitely not is child labor a good

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
thing

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,720
no

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
if you knew that a company was employing

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
child labor

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,679
would you have standing to do anything

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
about that

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,559
i certainly wouldn't if you if that

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
company was using software

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,679
that you had licensed to them under a

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
license that

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,679
prevents anyone from using the license

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
software should they employ child labor

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
would you not have standing then to

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
enforce that against that company

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
i don't think i really would have any

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,720
ability to do anything about it you know

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,520
i'm not a

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,039
i'm not a child labor crusader right i

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
don't have access to

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
a whole bunch of lawyers at my disposal

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
who are going to fight that battle for

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,600
me

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,960
i don't have access to any of the

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
resources i would need to fully

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,159
understand the situation

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,559
to even get into that conversation the

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,039
notion that i

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,000
as a random free software hacker who

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,520
happens to have commits in that tree

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
and the software happens to be used by

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
this company is going to have the

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,640
ability

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
to even begin legal process let alone

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
litigate that process through to a

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
conclusion

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
that harms them more than them just

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,760
saying screw it we'll rewrite your

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
commits

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,200
is farcical right exxon is not going to

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,520
say oh

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
oh james has 300 lines of code in that

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
tree we'd better listen to him

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
no they're going to hire some guy to

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
rewrite those 300 lines and tell me to

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,440
go screw off

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
stories no there's no scenario in the

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
world in which i become some sort of

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,039
effective social

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,880
justice crusader for children's rights

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,799
because i have a few commits in a tree

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,039
it's just it's a it's a it's a power

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,400
fantasy that developers have

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,120
that their free software is this giant

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,880
lever

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,200
that can change the world in ways that

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
it's just not realistic it's just not

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,240
any any way that's going to happen so

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
you should just complicate all the

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,400
licenses

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,240
for the sake of this fantasy it doesn't

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
make any sense this is good to back to

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,520
you drowning out the questions it's

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
really small

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
but no i mean so are you suggesting then

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,039
that it only applies

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
to um software for which you're a small

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,200
developer that

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
indeed if you had developed a piece of

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
software that exxon could not simply

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
rewrite your commits out of

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
that everything that you just said then

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
would not apply i think it would be

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
really difficult to find

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,320
a developer with that kind of level of

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,240
uh

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,679
level of contribution certainly i don't

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
know of any and

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,679
and sorry last question how does putting

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,410
ethics in licenses make them make your

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,039
job harder

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,039
[Applause]

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,679
the this one because i need two hands

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,440
this is molly for the second affirmative

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,159
seven minutes seven minutes

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
um and those mics don't work if you

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,159
don't have pockets

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
uh so i would like to lead off with the

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
statement that

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,559
james made an argument against licenses

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
in general and i think that's an

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,840
important thing to address

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,520
because software freedom in the first

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,760
place is based on licenses and copyright

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
in order to make those things happen so

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
i want to kind of lay the basis to begin

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,679
with that we do need

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
licenses and i think that's a great

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
place to start

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,039
i'd also like to respond to the comments

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,240
about the power of developers

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,120
so for example the hillary for america

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,240
campaign

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
was using debian for some of their stuff

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
the international space station uses

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
debian um

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
government organizations use debian and

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,159
build software off of debian

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,080
so if it's the case that that actual

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
piece of software is that important it's

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,200
been in development

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,039
for a significant number of years

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,880
creating an easy replacement for it

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,400
is not so easy um so by a large project

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
making that adoption

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,360
you're creating like a major use case

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,559
uh and that's really important um

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,000
sorry i'm not quite ready

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,200
oh um uh reaching out to communities

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
uh to encourage building a commons is

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,919
possible so

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
one of the other things is the comment

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
that like

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,960
we're going to need to reach out to new

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
communities to get them involved and it

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
is possible right

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
so you have people who are currently not

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
developing in this sphere and not

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,919
participating

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
because they're concerned about use so

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
suddenly

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,799
not just talking about definitions of

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
freedom and openness we're building a

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,279
commons that we weren't capable of

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,180
building before

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
five minutes left okay um

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,159
[Music]

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
uh great um in addition to that i would

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,120
like to

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
make some comments in support of what

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,720
john had said

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,360
um which are noted on my phone

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,799
somewhere great no that's not it wow

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
thanks for your patience everyone this

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,320
is not

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,039
uh great anyway um let's see what i

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
remember

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,240
um so from the environmental perspective

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,279
um i would like to add that we look at

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,880
software in terms of one of the ways we

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,600
can look at software and environmental

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
impact

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,679
is things like processing speed and

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,320
server load

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,919
and making significant changes to make

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,919
our software more

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,520
efficient will have positive

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,880
environmental impact

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,279
so it's easy to argue that that will be

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
more effective if you have free and open

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,720
source software

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,679
but in addition to that you're going to

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,080
be able

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
uh to better reduce that load because

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
you're going to have

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,039
more people focusing on it since it's a

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,080
thing that they care about

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,200
right um in response to the

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,880
concept of military and police use

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,360
um so one of the things that happens

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
should we reach a point where things

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
like facial

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
facial recognition technology and

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
different surveillance technologies are

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
under free and open licenses

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,120
they're going to become better and more

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,080
effective and this creates an even

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
greater threat

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,520
from police forces right so if we're

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
able to build into those

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,799
forced ethics it's going to make a

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
bigger difference

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
for these individual communities out

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,039
there and the people who are already

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
at risk right in terms of labor

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,200
practices

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,320
um we see abuse

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
of labor um all over the world uh

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,760
like and and things that limit labor

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
right so

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,080
one example i really like is in saudi

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,440
arabia how there's a culture

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
of women being unable to work especially

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
with

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
like without support from their husbands

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,039
or their fathers

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
and by creating licenses that ensure

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,080
this sort of behavior

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,480
we're creating an opportunity for them

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
to participate in the creation of these

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
comments

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,120
um i'd like to add that one of the

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,559
things people brought up

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,320
is the confusion of licenses and the

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,320
incompatibility of licenses

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,919
right there's nothing to say that you

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
have to create licenses that are

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,640
incompatible

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,400
and there's nothing to say that you need

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,559
to have 50 different licenses each

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
addressing a different social issue

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,159
i would propose the adoption of a

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,200
creative commons-based model

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,240
um where there is a base license written

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,159
off of which people can add things um

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,039
so that would mean that you can have

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,600
your no ice claws and you can have

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
your no child labor clause and you can

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,559
have your

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,400
equal like equity and equal

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,120
participation clause

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
um how much time do i have okay great um

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,679
you can add those clauses

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,520
without forcing yourself

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,080
to deal with incompatibility in the same

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,600
ways right um and i would go as far to

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,320
argue that while ethics

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
change and what society views as ethics

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,000
change

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,240
the ethics of individual contributors

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
might not change as much

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,159
so they're able to own these decisions

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
and choose how their software is being

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,679
used

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,200
but also how their software uh is

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,760
affecting the world and having an

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,799
impact now i think the like the obvious

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
question to that

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,679
is like what if somebody creates a like

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,919
only nazis clause

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
um and i would like to immediately

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,039
address

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
uh that that sort of problem is

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,440
something that

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,120
we can deal with uh managing by things

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,880
like forking projects

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,320
by looking karen's frowning at me

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,200
are you sure okay

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,279
and making adjustments and building code

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,399
and all those other wonderful things

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,919
um so uh in general i think there's a

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,039
lot of opportunity

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,000
to reinforce the good uh that licenses

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,559
can do and

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
like in another like immediate response

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,320
um i believe

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,440
licenses can have teeth and i believe

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
that licensing

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,880
is really important not just because it

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
creates an insurance software freedom in

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,039
the first place

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,520
but because it has impact even when

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,600
things like uh employment price like

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,320
pressure from employees doesn't work

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,240
like let's look at google google fired

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,799
people who are doing organizing

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,000
for their company obviously like

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,120
companies maintain

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,840
power right and companies maintain

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,520
uh control over our access to things we

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,000
need to survive

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
like health care uh in some countries

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
sorry i know europe different than the

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,159
u.s

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
salaries which uh for which what enable

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,399
us to

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,919
buy the things we need so companies will

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
have more power

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,679
uh companies do have more power when

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,679
there aren't forced ethics

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
hit me with your best shot okay so now i

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,159
have cross-examination from the negative

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
side who from the negative side would

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,720
like to cross

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,799
no i thought you were going to do it no

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
i'm not i i would like to but i

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,880
am the moderator oh god okay three

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,799
minutes please i'm ready

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,360
all right so you mentioned earlier

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,320
that debian could change its license and

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,000
force

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,440
nasa and everyone else to suddenly adopt

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,799
something i'm not sure what but

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,399
what are the practical ways that it

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,840
could do that how many tens of thousands

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,159
of people would it take to get

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,880
on board in order to to change debian's

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
licensing

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
well i i think you could run a general

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,480
resolution

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,360
uh to manage that i'm not positive i

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
should know this

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,559
and in which case you'd only need a

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
significant percentage of a thousand

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,440
people

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,279
to agree to that decision and then you

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,399
cross off some who won't vote

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,240
um so i think it's uh possible for

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,640
debian to make a decision like that

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,720
so so debian can re-license all the

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,480
software in debian with

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
with a vote of the debian people i think

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
you can re-license a certain amount of

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
software

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
these are things i'm not sure about like

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,559
these are guesses on my behalf

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
um but like the project itself has a lot

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
of power

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,559
the individuals in it have a lot of

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
power and any member of the project can

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,679
put forth the general resolution

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
to make a significant change to the

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,960
community so for example

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,880
instead of re-licensing the whole

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,720
project they could make the decision to

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
pass a general resolution

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
that will mean all future packages and

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
all future work

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,360
are required to be under one of these

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,320
ethical licenses

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,880
if companies already have decided that

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
they are

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
avoiding things like copyleft how do you

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,480
how do you go about

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,240
convincing them to adopt one of these

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,520
license that have the ethical clause

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,600
that's a really good question um i think

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
because because companies are afraid of

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
copyleft and i have lots of stories

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,679
about that

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
um and i'm sure people here have even

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,200
more um

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
but uh when you're looking especially if

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,679
we can look at the foundational

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
technologies

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
and the things that we're using as the

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,960
basis on which we're building everything

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,360
then suddenly it matters a lot more

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
who is putting these requirements onto

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,519
things

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,960
um now the

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,240
well no i won't tell you what question

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,720
you should ask me next in response to

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
that

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,799
no please go ahead no no it's good it's

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
all you all you

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
so i think my last question really is if

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,519
you really

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,159
need communities

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,919
in order to do this enforcement how does

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
locking yourself into one rigid

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
framework around a license

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
help you when what you really need is

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,519
that community power in the first place

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,799
that's a really good question i think

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,279
one there are social issues

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,480
that we need to handle at a time scale

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,760
that's a lot shorter

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,200
than things that can be um accomplished

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
by having a community

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,200
make enforcement and make social changes

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,559
i think we can say with high confidence

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
that they're terrible people in all

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,080
communities

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
and that social norms aren't being

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
enforced uh

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,159
to change that so by having something

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
like licenses you are forcing a very

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
sudden change

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,080
now we have the second negative uh

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
construction that's going to be done by

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,880
josh simmons

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,440
thank you destructive i'm new to this

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
debate stuff

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,600
okay disclaimer right

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,600
let's start with that

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,320
so first i want to say that

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,200
i think we all share a desire for a more

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,360
ethical and just

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
world i think that is something that we

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
have broad alignment on

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,720
however i am here to persuade you

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,159
further that licenses are not the way to

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,360
go about this

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,600
first i just want to ask the audience a

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,159
question how many peop here by show of

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
hands

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,640
think that your code of ethics are

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,640
universalizable to everybody everywhere

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,840
bold bold

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,799
realistically realistically i'm not here

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
to make an argument for moral

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,480
relativism i think that's a sticky

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,200
wicket but i do think that ethics are

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
complicated

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
and that they're highly localized and

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,760
that what's right for us here may not be

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
right for

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,200
people everywhere and

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,159
even though there are there's much to be

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
said about their

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,919
the organizations like the united

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
nations who have definitions of human

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,559
rights

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,600
which are reasonably universal

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,799
i don't know that we can truly trust

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,399
these organizations

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,919
to maintain those definitions in good

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,279
faith

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,799
i mean this this is going to be an easy

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,640
one who thinks the united nations is a

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,080
good thing

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,519
yeah right but but how many people feel

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,360
good about the efficacy

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,799
of the united nations exactly

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,159
okay so along those lines uh you know i

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,840
also want to note that the united

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
nations has a has this

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
this way of governing such that you

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,480
could have a single

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,280
bad actor a single nation state say

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,359
no to a proposal to limit a really

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,000
important expansion of rights

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,960
thus i don't think that we should hinge

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,760
ethics

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,919
in licenses on on a united nations or

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,839
other body similarly there's the

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,159
american civil civil liberties union

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,919
or the red cross only one of those

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,359
really has opinions about ethics

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,800
but both of them do valuable

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,079
philanthropic work

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,200
however neither of them are an

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,000
unalloyed good both of those

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
organizations

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
have a history of causing legitimate

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,839
harm as well as all the good that

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,359
they're doing

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,280
i don't think that we can outsource our

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,440
ethics because there's no institution

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,599
that we can rely on to truly capture

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,599
this

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,440
now do no harm night do

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,119
do no harm style licenses ethical

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
licenses

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,800
we we can't capture all of the ethics in

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,640
these licenses and so

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,720
i think we would need to outsource them

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
to organizations and to my earlier point

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
i don't think there's a single

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,040
organization that we can really trust to

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,320
do that

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,480
further i want to say a little bit about

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
the unenforceability here

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,599
you know there's even people who are

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,079
proponents of ethical licenses

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,839
concede that these things would be very

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,480
very difficult to enforce

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,560
can you really legislate these in a

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,680
court of law

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,800
tbd we really don't know but even if you

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,119
could

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,960
who would the amount of enforcement

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,640
action that's happening today

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,160
is practically nil and so using licenses

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,119
as a vehicle that just seems like an

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,119
ineffective strategy

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,240
and then there's the issue of vagueness

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,839
you know some

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,520
licenses are well crafted most of them

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,280
not so much and a lot of these things

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,680
leave a lot of room for

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,119
uh leave a lot of room for

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,160
interpretation

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,280
and as far as i understand it

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,839
judges don't like it when people are

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,520
trying to be clever and if something is

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,720
vague and arguable well you're not going

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,359
to be able to make a convincing case in

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,359
the first place

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
i also want to note that there is more

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,240
than one ethical framework

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,760
the most well-trained ethicists

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,839
understand that for any

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,599
sticky problem we need to bring multiple

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,200
ethical frameworks to bear on that issue

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
in order to really see our way through

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,400
it

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,400
such that in most cases we need to

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,880
approach ethical ethical decisions

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,119
on a case-by-case basis it's really not

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,200
universalizable

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,280
we cannot capture this complexity and a

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
license

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
and i want to speak to some of the harms

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,400
that people have have noted potential

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
harms

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
one of the reasons that we have the four

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,640
freedoms and the open source definition

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,280
and we have these organizations that

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,520
steward licenses generally is to limit

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
license proliferation

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
we limit license proliferations that we

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,079
can encourage adoption of a standard

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,599
that gives us a give us gives us a solid

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,119
baseline from which we can build on

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,119
to the point about incompat about

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
compatibility

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
it may be that we can design a license

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,720
that provides a solid foundation and we

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,680
can have these additional

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,760
uh layers on top of it for you know no

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,079
ice or no child labor or

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,680
uh nine to six but if we do that

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,720
do the components with those different

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,079
licenses are those interoperable

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,359
i think that's an open question and i

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,640
think that's one that we need to answer

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,640
before we experiment here

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
i also want to note that i i think that

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,160
this has the potential to drive

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
down adoption of open source and free

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
free software

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
and limit the very real good that's

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,359
already happening through things like

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
humanitarian free and open source

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,400
software

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,480
we've got sahana and usahidi for

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,599
disaster response my myfast initiative

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,119
for the unbanked

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
libre health for health systems in the

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,200
developing world water project and open

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,599
air quality for detecting pollution

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,440
we have projects that are making a

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
difference in all of these spaces that

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,359
people are

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,720
raising rightly raising concerns about

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,160
the projects that are addressing them

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
using the existing frameworks

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,119
i think that licenses are an ineffective

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,760
vehicle

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,960
and a vehicle that could cause

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,960
unintended consequences

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
i think the other proposals the other

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,359
options that we have on the table

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,839
are the ones that we should really be

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,800
pursuing now i'm all for an all of the

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,040
above approach

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,720
we are faced with extraordinarily

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
massive challenges at this time in our

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,240
in our existence we should try all of

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
the things let's throw the spaghetti at

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
the wall and figure it out

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,359
but i'm of the opinion that even though

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
we may try with licenses

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,400
that is not the right vehicle codes of

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,440
conduct

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,040
refusing to support accept issues pull

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
requests from bad actors

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
refusing to grant use of the project

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
trademark how

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,000
seeking regulation from governments

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,920
doing labor organizing so

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,839
that we can say no when we're asked to

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,160
do something that we know is wrong

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,160
thank you

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,920
we're going to have cross-examination

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,400
from the affirmative who from the

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
the side's going to do it dash all

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,720
righty

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,000
um okay so uh first off

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,680
um so if if the point

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,520
if we shouldn't be enforcing licenses at

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,880
all what what are we doing here

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
i mean specifically in this room in the

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,359
legal and policy room at fosdem

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
i didn't say we shouldn't be enforcing

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,240
licenses i think we should have more

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,560
enforcement frankly

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,400
okay what does it matter if ethics are

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,000
localized because aren't licenses

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
personal to the author shouldn't it only

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
be a question of whether

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,520
the ethics embodied by the license are

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,880
those that the author releasing their

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,320
work under that license would want them

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
to be

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,280
you know i think every author has a

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,160
prerogative to license things the way

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,599
they see fit

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,599
and i think that's that's right and

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,400
proper however

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,839
the whole point of ethical licenses as i

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,720
understand it

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,680
is to move the needle in the world at

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,560
large

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,560
and so if it's only uh addressing the

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,480
concerns of that author but limiting

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,319
the possibility for their their software

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,359
to be adopted by other people

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,440
then they're cutting off their nose

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,880
despite their face i'm curious as to

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
what you think as to why that would be

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,200
limiting but i've got some other

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
questions so i'll proceed

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,480
you mentioned the un can the u.n sue you

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,480
for something unethical you did

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,599
i have no idea i don't think so i

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
believe the answer is no i didn't

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,119
research that but i believe the answer

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,839
is no

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,599
whereas if a license or had licensed

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,119
software to you on ethical terms and you

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,440
had breached those would the license or

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,520
be able to sue you for that

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,760
i believe so presumably yes so it seems

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,520
that licenses with ethical licenses then

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
offer a lever that are larger than

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,480
perhaps

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
these other community pressures and you

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,359
know organizations

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,440
i will note that though the u.n may not

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,280
be able to sue me the u.n does have

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
uh does have mechanisms for exerting

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
pressure and

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,800
so would you concede then that a bad

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,480
actor can be pressured by

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,680
positive actors to change their behavior

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,000
yes and that's why i made many

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,720
alternative proposals okay

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
and if someone was to kill me for

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,520
instance

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,680
they could be tried for murder correct

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,839
yes so if they could be tried for murder

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,000
why would there also be a framework for

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,200
my family to bring a wrongful death suit

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,960
it seems that you're arguing that if

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,720
there's an existing framework for

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,319
addressing a problem that

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,319
redundant frameworks aren't necessary

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,400
i think that grossly mischaracterizes my

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,760
argument

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,319
okay i'll take that um what would you

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
like to

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,359
would you like to reinstate what you

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
meant then by saying that there are

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,040
better mechanisms than licenses why

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,440
can't licenses also exist as a mechanism

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,560
to reinforce what already exists to

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,800
police ethics

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,200
because they are friction they are rigid

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,119
they are difficult to change

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,880
because there are better mechanisms that

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,000
we could uh have

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,240
disproportionate impact with

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,280
and so you mentioned that licenses are

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,400
ineffective how are they ineffective

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
well let's look at the level of

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,680
enforcement action

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,000
okay and then i guess finally sorry

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,200
i'm trying to struggling with this um

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,720
i've got to admire this

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,200
so why why why does it that ethics have

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
to be vague

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
so uh both teams have agreed to do only

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
one rebuttal so we can get the question

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,480
so we'll have the first uh negative

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,040
rebuttal i think is it right yeah

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,040
so who let's

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
i think what this comes down to for us

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,560
really

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,119
is that the effort you put in

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,760
to putting all the stuff in licenses

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,240
might

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,920
theoretically if a whole bunch of

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,880
improbable things happen

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,839
eventually result in somebody somewhere

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,240
being pressured

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,599
to act for the public good and the list

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,079
of things you would have to do

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,640
that would have to go right is just kind

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,040
of

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,800
amazingly long and impractical right

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,400
you'd have to convince communities

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,000
to adopt it and maybe you could do that

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
that actually seems like there are

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,319
definitely some communities that will do

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,839
it

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,200
i mean there's there's certainly some

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,119
free software communities that want to

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,040
consign themselves to a relevancy

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,280
in one fell swoop i believe that that is

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
true

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,480
then you would have to get knowledge

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,599
of a violation understand it well enough

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,599
begin some sort of process to address it

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,200
have that process fail begin some sort

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,240
of enforcement process

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,440
have these clauses even recognized

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,599
anywhere in the world as

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
valid and enforced and reach a point

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,920
litigate something all the way to a

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
conclusion

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,839
and then try to enforce a judgment

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,359
that's a lot of steps

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,280
really improbable steps i don't know

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,839
many free software projects that have

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,760
that many steps it's not a cost-free

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,680
process to get there right the notion

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,640
that we will get benefit out of this

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,240
is all very theoretical very attenuated

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,920
and you end up with a rather small

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,760
effect out the other end in isolated

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,680
instances

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,119
but you pay a big cost for that right

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,280
every license

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,200
bifurcation that splits a community into

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,520
two where we've got the same piece of

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,079
software being written 20 times for 20

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,160
different

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
ethical license offshoots and none of

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
them are compatible with each other

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
because

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,680
the climate license says your stuff has

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
to be climate compatible and the labor

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,920
license says your stuff has to be labor

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,760
compatible

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,839
and those two can't cooperate with each

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
other right the cost of splitting these

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,440
communities

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,359
is very high the only reason free

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,200
software works so well why it's on the

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,119
ascendancy and the way it is

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,119
is because we've created this massive

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,040
pool of common value that is worth

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,480
accessing if you split those into

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,000
smaller pools

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
they become tiny puddles that we can

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
just hop over

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,680
that's not going to work at the end of

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
the day if you want

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,960
ethics if you want ethical use of

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
technology

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,040
you have to do it without the shortcuts

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,040
you have to do the organizing

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,359
you have to do the community building

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,440
there are no cheat codes here

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,880
so if you want ethics go back to your

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,640
communities and talk to them about

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,480
what your community is worth and why it

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
is worth being in that community

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,800
that is how we're going to win this

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,960
battle not by writing a bunch of rules

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,440
thank you

00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:41,200
[Applause]

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,040
so we have the final affirmative

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,040
rebuttal

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,640
because we you agreed that we do we

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
forego the last rebuttal for audience

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,079
remember

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,079
you agree to the beginning

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,130
[Laughter]

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,319
i apologize if you didn't agree okay

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,319
feel free to jump in okay go ahead

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,040
am i unmuted now yes okay

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
okay well so the world's gonna end we

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,839
know that uh

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,599
we really need to try to do something

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:19,200
about this um i understand

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,040
and i feel uh it's the concerns for free

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,480
software as a model are serious if we

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,200
start thinking about adding new things

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
to it but

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,960
um i also think the free software has

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,800
succeeded because because it's an

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,680
ethical foundation and that's why people

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,040
who have

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,400
uh when they achieve other social goals

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
are turning to our free software

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
licenses to modify them to try to

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
achieve different goals it's that

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,520
ethical foundation that's bringing

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,760
people

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,240
to it you know it's it's github that

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,720
made collaboration tangibly easy

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,720
not the four freedoms the four freedoms

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,800
the four freedoms are the ethical

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,480
foundation and that's why people are

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
interested in what we're doing

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,040
now will these licenses be enforced uh

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,560
maybe maybe not but i think they will be

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,800
more likely to be enforced than

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,480
uh than copyleft licenses for example

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
because they're embodying

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,920
uh things that are very tangible and

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,040
immediate harms that people feel very

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,400
strongly about

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,240
but as we know even if they're not

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,839
enforced they still serve a a

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,359
strong function i think the argument

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,079
about community norms is actually an

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,720
argument for

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,880
having ethical for having social goals

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,079
addressed in license drafting

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
because that enables different

00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,000
communities to more concretely define

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
the ethical reasons and the social

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,920
reasons that they're working together

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,280
would we have incompatibilities

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,640
maybe but remember that people can

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,079
release their work under more than one

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,599
license at the same time and make them

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,640
available for all of the causes that

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,800
they care about

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,000
we also still have the option of having

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,760
an omnibus license

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,599
and a body that vets you know different

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,640
parts what can be added to that

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,240
and really what's the cost of

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,760
incompatibility anyway it just means

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,599
that someone has to write code

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,200
that really they shouldn't have to write

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,640
because it's already out there well

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,200
that's not as big of a deal as global

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,920
warming so i think we can stomach it

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,359
um you know and i'm also a little bit

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,319
confused because free software is an

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,200
ethical value

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,280
these things that we're talking about

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,640
are ethical values so kind of every

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,520
argument against

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,960
the rigidity of an ethical value or the

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,720
you know ability to come to agreement on

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,079
these things to me is an argument also

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,520
against free software in general you

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,960
know how are we able to agree on any

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,640
ethical value why is it

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
free software alone that gets to be the

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,680
rigid ethical value

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,119
but not opposing labor exploitation

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,960
uh and i think that uh

00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,880
you know we have laws that are very

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
complicated to enforce

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
but they still get enforced and they

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,319
still serve a deterrent effect even

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,839
though

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,440
you can also list all the steps that you

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,359
have to go through for a police you know

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,160
a police officer to catch somebody

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,920
doing something prove it in court not

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,520
make any mistakes along the way

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,040
not have any appeals succeed like

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
enforcing any laws a really difficult

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
thing

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,119
we think we can do that with licenses as

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,839
well fundamentally we think we need to

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
try

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,680
and specifically we should try in the

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,200
drafting stage see what happens we know

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,760
a lot of people want these licenses so

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
adoption

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,559
really isn't a concern people have

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,480
already asked them for them and they're

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,839
already doing them

00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,839
thank you

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,559
so i want to thank both the teams again

00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,640
for for going their final rebuttals to

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,400
have uh to have audience questions

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,000
i'm going to ask them that more than any

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,640
other debate we've had today this slide

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,440
obviously applies um but i'm going to

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,040
ask

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,319
everyone to stay in character for the

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,319
audience questions if you don't mind

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,440
because i think it'll be more fun

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:31,839
fontana's going to bring around that's

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,839
mike for questions i think

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,720
hello hi hi here so

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,720
this is the first time i'm asking a

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,839
question like that so

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,000
uh psychedepoint was mentioned earlier

00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,720
that

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,520
having a policy like say this software

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,040
has to be

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,040
green or try to improve reduce the

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,920
the impact the environmental impact of

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,000
the process making things faster

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,000
a friend of mine his working in uh

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,599
in construction road construction they

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,480
say that

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,160
if you build more roads there will be

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,119
more traffic

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,200
so if you make a software faster it will

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,520
be used more and more

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,079
it's really a very temporary at least

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,000
based on that idea very temporary

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,440
the opinion is that it's temporary if

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,640
you make something faster

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,680
if you claim that this software

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,640
is used to make things faster or to

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,960
improve the

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,800
to reduce the let's say the

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,520
environmental impact

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,440
we are just it's a very temporary fix

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,440
i'm sorry do you have a question

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,640
that's what i'm saying it's a temporary

00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,319
fix we are

00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,200
by playing uh

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,720
but is this a question so the opinion if

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,119
it's just a comment i'm sorry

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
we can respond to it and then move on do

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,359
you want to respond

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,559
yeah sure i mean i think i think the

00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,480
point one of the points that i think

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,240
that you raised is that when we create

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,839
tools those tools can also

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,520
enable the various behaviors that we

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,800
don't want to see happen you build roads

00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,720
and you're letting traffic happen and i

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,640
think that software is a great

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,400
um allegory for that you build software

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,240
and then people use it to police their

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,520
societies to drill oil to do all these

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
things but that

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,040
that because of that that's all the more

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,599
reason why it's incumbent upon us

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,040
to build these ethical guard rails in

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,720
place so that people can develop

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,160
software knowing and confidence

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,839
that as long as they enforce their

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,680
rights in it that it won't be

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,359
applied towards these you know means

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,520
that you don't want to see happen

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,119
um i would like to add to that that

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,480
let's say you're building a fundamental

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,599
piece of software like an operating

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,240
system and you're making it more

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,920
efficient

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,599
it's way better for people to adopt the

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,960
more efficient operating system

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,559
than it is to use something that's heavy

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,559
clunky and uses a lot of resources

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,079
thank you great panel i have a question

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,640
do you understand software freedom as

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,640
the freedom of the user to choose

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,640
how to use the software or is the

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:19,839
freedom of the developer to restrict how

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,839
the user uses the software

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,240
in that the developer has the ability

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:42,480
to define the purpose that they are

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,640
making their work for and the user has

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,000
certain rights as well but you know we

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,480
have examples all over society

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,680
of rules about um users not being you

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,200
know there are limits when as soon as

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,480
your use of something causes harm to

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,440
another person that use can be

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,960
restricted

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,960
likewise if that heart that uses a

00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,400
public health risk it can be restricted

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,559
and that's where i think the ability

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,160
that's where i think the ability

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,160
of developers to have some more control

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,160
comes in and distributors

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,839
no no no no

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,079
um i'd like to open up if there are any

00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,079
women

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,520
uh i

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,280
i agree uh

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,640
it's i don't i don't think that means

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,880
i'm conceited conceding

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,280
uh to the resolution but i agree with

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,319
their response to that

00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,800
uh i'd like to really quickly just

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,240
uh ask if there are any women or

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,319
non-binary folks in the room who would

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,200
like to ask a question so do you want to

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,319
respond

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,160
yeah yeah sure while we're waiting for

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,599
more hands i would just uh to to follow

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,040
up on the response to marco's question i

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,640
think that it is definitively if we look

00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,559
to the four freedoms the freedom of the

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,880
user receiving the software and that

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,480
is what free software depends on but i

00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
think going back to everything that

00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,800
lewis so eloquently addressed in the

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
previous talk

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,160
that sometimes you have to decide where

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,480
these freedoms need to cave

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,480
in order to accomplish other goals that

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,000
are just as if not even more pressing

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,760
and important and i think that

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
that's what the core of this discussion

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,040
is

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,280
very quick addendum we're advocating

00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,240
putting uh the the items in the license

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,240
not in the four freedoms

00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,200
um yeah well hi um so

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,440
first the disclaimer is also for me and

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,319
my question is for the affirmative team

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,599
over the last

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,559
decade or so pretty much all big open

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,319
source projects

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,400
in addition to having an open source

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,319
license have in code of conduct

00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,680
and everything that depends on

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,839
governance and

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,440
ethics and describing what is right and

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,280
what is wrong in the community

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,040
is defined in the code of conduct and

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,160
how to handle that

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,000
so my question is if it's easy to do all

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,920
that in the license

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,520
why do we have code of conduct and where

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,520
are we all wrong in the last 10 years

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,880
that's a very good question that i feel

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,280
like i'm the one who's supposed to

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,480
respond to it

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,520
i would make a few quick points

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,559
um which are perhaps that is a place

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,760
where we need to

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:19,040
be looking at including in licensing

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,000
um codes of conduct uh govern

00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,200
the behavior of individuals uh and how

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
they're interacting

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,520
um and also tie into a lot of their like

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,440
fundamental rights

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,000
um so challenging that with a license i

00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,119
think is a much harder question

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,680
like how do we look at what this means

00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,760
in a legal context especially as the

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,720
legal context varies so much country to

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,640
country

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,760
um i would also kind of add to that that

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,880
codes of conduct are like not

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,599
always effective so i want to i want to

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,760
thank these

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,640
uh debaters here of of all the debates i

00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
think this is the

00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,920
where the people most had to take

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,559
positions they don't necessarily agree

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,119
with

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,000
and i thank them for doing that for the

00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,119
pedagogical purposes

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,119
of this debate thank you

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,200
and so so uh we're doing questions

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,480
uh brief questions of the whole audience

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,040
after each debate since we're not doing

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,799
winners

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,400
uh by raise of hands how many people

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,680
learned something about these issues

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
in this debate they didn't know about

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,040
before they came in

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,319
and how many people's minds were on one

00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,720
side of the issue and now are on the

00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:32,400
other after this debate

00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,319
only one three three okay

00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,359
but many but it looks like a lot of

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,880
people learned something and we're

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,280
really glad that you did

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,400
uh if the debaters for the next uh

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,400
debate could come down here

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
