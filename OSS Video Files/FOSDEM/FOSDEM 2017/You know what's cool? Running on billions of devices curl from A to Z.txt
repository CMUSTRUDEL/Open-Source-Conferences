At: FOSDEM 2017

Thousands of contributors help building the curl software which runs onseveral billions of devices and are affecting every human in the connectedworld daily. How this came to happen, who contributes and how Daniel at thewheel keeps it all together.

This is a description of a small project with a major reach. curl and libcurlcan probably be considered corner stones in a world of client-side Internettransfers and in particular HTTP, running on every imaginable operating systemand CPU architecture in use today. Started in the late 90s, the software nowruns in billions of devices and is quite likely one of the most widely usedsoftware components - any category. Daniel takes us through how it started,how it works and why it never gets done.

hello FOSDEM next up we have Daniel

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,710
Steinberg the author of curl and telling

00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:07,520
it what's cool when it's running on

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:10,880
billions of devices hey let's go

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,610
hi first time I just wanted to get this

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,729
order into the spirit here by showing

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:20,659
you a little snippet from my inbox I got

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,920
an email it's actually a year ago now it

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:29,840
started out like this nice and friendly

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,039
right it was a woman she had even hit me

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,440
a couple of months ago she had a big

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:36,020
problem she you know she had her account

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,299
hacked on Instagram she told me in one

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,459
in my help I had no idea why she would

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,840
contact me about that right talk to

00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,950
Instagram I have no idea what you're

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,399
talking about why are you emailing me

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,659
anyway well you know I found your email

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,539
address here so you must be sort of

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,879
associated somehow right so please talk

00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,879
to your friends at Instagram and sort it

00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,819
out for me so I try to sort of explain

00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,729
to her that no no no no no they use code

00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:08,149
I wrote so I had didn't even know that

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,700
until you told me so but she didn't

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,220
really understand or she didn't really

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,140
believe me I think but in the end I

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,050
think I convinced her that no no no

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,510
Instagram did their thing I did mine it

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,250
just happened to end up there so

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,909
everything turned quiet for a while and

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:29,030
then she made me again and she said yeah

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:33,890
well I went to a wire that at my hacking

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:36,050
code was used by Instagram so well so

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,590
she she brought me than some new

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:43,000
evidence sort of share with me that she

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,760
had found my name also in the Spotify

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,430
terms and condition Exhibit B right team

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,760
look

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,430
my name is a Spotify to Instagram as

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,959
Spotify both on her phone that's sort of

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,299
that can't be a coincidence I had been

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,370
lying to her the entire time I was

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,549
involved from the beginning please fix

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,170
this and you know these are big

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:07,689
companies have you we don't want to mess

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,060
with these guys you don't want to show

00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:14,829
that your portable instagram has Spotify

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,590
hacking ring so please and she you

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:21,609
coined the phrase please unpacked the

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,909
act and I sort of that not rhymes with

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,829
me

00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:27,730
so I'm trying to unhak hacks all the

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:31,030
time no that's sort of some interesting

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,709
stories from my inbox so um I'd like to

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,510
share some other stories from the

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,939
hacking ring or perhaps more accurately

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,439
an open-source project that I've been

00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:46,810
filling with for a while

00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:52,660
it's called curve and we have a colon

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:56,560
slash slash in the logo curl is an old

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,150
project but just to make sure that we're

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,650
all on the same page here it's an open

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,859
source project we make a command-line

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,519
tool and we make a library and we

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:09,489
transfer data specified as URLs usually

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,230
usually and it supports protocols

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:16,539
basically you know HTP you have to pay

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:19,630
your bla bla bla so of course we started

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:21,789
a long time ago and a long time ago of

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,039
course we had sort of a lot of building

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:28,570
blocks but we didn't have a curve so

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:31,900
like any other project you start at some

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,909
point and in my case I one point wanted

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,070
to have a little tool to download

00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:39,159
current rates from the web I was writing

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,120
an IRC BOTS and in our C channel you of

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:43,030
course won't have some real-time

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,770
currency exchange commands so I needed

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,800
to just download Karen's rates like

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,840
daily or so right HTTP sites have curves

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,660
rates I just needed to download them

00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:02,560
so I found a little tool in same year

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:05,620
this movie premiered 1996 so I started

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,040
that actually sort of make it download a

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,740
HTTP couple of hundred lines of code

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,530
HTTP 1 to 0 it's really really well it's

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,840
probably not a simple protocol but if

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,740
you're doing it a bit carelessly and

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,169
just fast it's really simple so then

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,030
then sort of yeah that started to work

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,900
and then suddenly we found out that wow

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,750
they have currency on gopher sites too I

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,150
had no free support and currency rates

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,830
on FTP sites so yeah we had enough data

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,290
to support you and the the previous that

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,600
moment it had been called HTTP GET and

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:48,220
it was called URL yet and then one day

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,720
we added ftp upload support and suddenly

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,440
the naming was wrong again and we

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,210
released curl 1998 will it supports a

00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:03,460
chappie go for an ftp and ftp upload

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:05,350
yeah 1998 March 20 so and then yeah you

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,760
know we're nope a source project we can

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,010
bunch of friends we had stuff we like

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,800
and we fixed some bugs and other people

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,700
come around and we keep on working on it

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:22,180
and the number of lines of code sort of

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:23,530
grew over the years I think it's rather

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,090
suspicious that we can actually have it

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,860
I mean where's it gonna end

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,410
but anyway so we've been working on this

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,370
little project it's not as small anymore

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:40,000
so now in 2017 with support I think it's

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:45,970
about 21 protocol 21 protocols I believe

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,620
and a lot of features and basically what

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,210
you want to play with with your else and

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,080
Internet protocols and transfers back

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,080
and forth or blah blah blah

00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,800
a lot of things so when we've been

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,670
working on this little project in our

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,350
bedrooms and spare time hacks over time

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,580
it's not really and you know you're

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,370
sitting there in your chambers and

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,400
working on your stuff and suddenly you

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,590
look around in the world and wow look at

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,150
that there's a lot of people using my

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,680
code right when did that happen so and

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,180
you start to hear from people that

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,500
they're actually using it and you look

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,390
around and you searched if we're helping

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,870
you find out that there's a lot of

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:33,240
companies using curves so wow that's and

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,100
that's these are sort of companies that

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,070
I've found proven that you're actually

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,470
using curve I'm sure that there are one

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,120
or two more and and even if you sort of

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,220
yeah you're drawn in these names but

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,220
even if you just look at some well-known

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:56,010
brand names those are some really fun

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:59,130
brand names it's sort of amazing but so

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,920
what would what would all these funny

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:05,460
companies use curl for her and when I

00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,990
say curl a lot of you a lot of whoever I

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,750
talk to they think about the really come

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,250
on line tool write all of these these

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,020
really using the command line tool know

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,970
well we started out a long time ago of

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,140
course when Mac OS X store leadership

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,210
curl as a default thing in Mac OS so it

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,310
ships with curl and lip curve by default

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,720
and they have a lot of tools nowadays

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,580
that they build themselves that use curl

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,460
and sort of yeah that's a lot of devices

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,410
using Mac OS and for some reason TVs are

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,900
also very fond of using curl so

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:40,410
basically any TV you have today have

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,440
curl in it and I'm done of course or

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,570
iPhones and iPads it's default in iOS -

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:51,270
so that's like what a billion active

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:54,180
devices curl is not default in Android

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,780
but I'll show you soon that all of your

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,970
Android phones have curly anyway so and

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,920
of course it's sort of billion in Linux

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,230
Linux service and stuff and writing

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,080
games has turned out to be very popular

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,910
too

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,769
it's portable so you can move your games

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,500
easily and it'll download things on hold

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:13,240
for all games and it's been very popular

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,070
in version control system plug it stick

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,579
yeah you think it and some others and

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,260
yeah course begging course you wouldn't

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,680
believe that a couple years ago right

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,279
why would every single corn either

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,140
transfer internet transfer per plant PHP

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,779
site supports its default transfer

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,839
library sort of in PHP PHP is what like

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,490
a quarter of the internet a lot of

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,560
set-top boxes blah blah blah and all

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:51,700
sorts of fun things Facebook right they

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:53,769
use it on the site and I mean as they

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,050
say it you've succeeded when you manage

00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:00,339
to sort of coined a verb right and I

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,870
would say that most people would

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,670
actually understand I'm most in this

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,440
room I'm sure that many of you would

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,390
understand if you'd say just curl it you

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,920
wouldn't know what it means it's not

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,920
sort of what you do with your hair so

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,550
all of this and I mean it's always

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:21,430
interesting so it's a sort of but how

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,260
many or actually using this and I all I

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,390
get this question a lot how many users

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,829
do you have like and I say yeah we are

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,670
billions of users but what is it user

00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:32,320
really I mean all of those devices I

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,910
mean most of you you won't even know

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,070
when you're using code right it's just

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,120
embedded somewhere so I tend to say that

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:42,160
we have a a bunch of users many and

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,910
looking closer I mean with so all those

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,660
things devices of course TVs printers

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,699
scanners set up boxes basically all of

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,970
you are running curl at least a couple

00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:59,850
of times a day and I'd say most of the

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,850
world is and I'll show you some fun

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,020
since I mean it's a fully open source if

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,180
MIT license people are downloading curl

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,290
they're building it in their corner and

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,450
they're running it and then them and

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,340
they never tell me about it right how

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,150
would I know when someone is using curl

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,640
I don't know

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,470
but sometimes someone figures that out

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,550
and send a link who look at what I found

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:24,670
your name in my washing machine and look

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,730
so and I started to collect a few and it

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,160
this is sort of yeah this is the license

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,770
screen in high OS look in every single

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,810
iOS device oh that's fun or what is this

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,400
ah that's the YouTube app on both iOS

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,590
and Android

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:43,720
what's that like 2 billion devices right

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:47,260
or or Skype that's also roughly a

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,840
billion stores and what sort of make me

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,720
really popular with my kids I could show

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,880
them that I'm actually in so that this

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
is ending sequence of Grand Theft Auto 5

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:04,589
that makes yes right that was popular

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,589
for a few minutes and then they run off

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,519
but this is sort of more sort of obscure

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,570
things you know you can find these if

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,870
you're really really searched for in

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,000
this ending sequence this is my name 42

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,630
minutes in the into the ending sequence

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,389
I think I'm the only one who ever saw

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,630
this well there's a YouTube video of

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,760
it's impossible to others but yeah and

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:32,940
other fun things then we can have a this

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,980
is a billboard outside Silicon Valley

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:40,620
curl on Billboard and take a moment and

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,620
really come online yes what does it do

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,600
actually the the ad guy who made this

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:55,360
sign he contacted me later and

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:57,100
apologized doesn't make any sense and

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,910
this is a fun this is the Nasdaq

00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,910
building in New York

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,550
and I don't know if you're seeing all

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,020
the way in the back but it's a good nice

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,360
curl command line in the middle of the

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,610
screen and that is actually a command

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,720
line you can you could invoke that to

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:20,580
order t-shirt so it's actually a genuine

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,530
ad campaign right you want to really see

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,740
this but that's this is an excerpt from

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,870
the fun email with person at Facebook

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,230
when they they tried the patch in

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,970
production seems to revive and the patch

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,920
in production I think it's extra fun

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,020
when it's the Facebook you know one

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,500
point nine billion users monthly or

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,870
whatever it is and nowadays basically

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,000
every mercy this core has curly in it

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,890
this License Agreement actually lists

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,500
every core model with a little checkbox

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:54,500
if Tasker and why not BMW or Volkswagen

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:08,730
right sky TV this is a team top box or

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,710
and Philips television and these are all

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,320
funny things but we just come back to

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,310
today Instagram and hacking Instagram

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:21,270
and Spotify hacking ring thing having my

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:25,470
name in this scenario since running man

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:28,400
makes interesting other sort of alright

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:31,350
sorry I forgot about PlayStation 4 but I

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,330
when people don't have my name well they

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,940
can find my name in all these weird

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,300
places and it's run into problems they

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,480
find my name and then email me so yeah

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,850
I'm really good that GPS is in Toyota

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,720
Corollas so if you have any problems

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,720
just come to me

00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:00,130
I just quoted he wrote it or the person

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,910
wrote it to me I assume it's a golden

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,500
gem so why why would they use curl our

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,160
little thing we made a long time ago

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,620
that's been going on forever well it

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,500
turns out that the Internet is sort of a

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,360
wild place you can follow the internet

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,670
specifications and doing protocols yeah

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,110
yeah you know basically every protocol

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,790
you're talking over the Internet is

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,190
documented in some specification or AB

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,440
C's and everything but it turns out that

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,209
we're all interpreting creating these

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,190
specifications differently and if you

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,459
try to use them over the internet you'll

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,199
find out that there are a lot of weird

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:39,000
areas and corners you have to sort of

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:43,120
fix and adapt to and it takes time and

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,660
accumulated over time it's not that easy

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,019
to just write a new client in in a short

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,529
time and we've already done this and it

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,029
works sorry wrong way and we're of

00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,160
course ok so I mean we're here trust

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,170
them of course we're open source so it's

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,630
easy for anyone and if the fact that is

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,089
MIT license makes it extremely easy for

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,100
all of these funny commercial companies

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,139
because they're never scared about the

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,420
license really and we have a

00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:14,019
ridiculously stable API you can actually

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,600
the first time we made the library we

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:18,730
released it in the in August 2001 and

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,829
actually those if you rebuild those

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,649
example programs from then they still

00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:27,310
work exactly as they did then we never

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:30,850
broke those we modify the API or the API

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:34,389
is slightly over time but only very very

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,839
old and it's still done a powerful

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:40,569
enough API for all of these devices all

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,579
of these use cases to actually get get

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:47,130
things done transfer data as they want

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:51,660
and

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:53,730
and nowadays well see library yeah yeah

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,430
I'm safe language buffer overflows blah

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,640
blah blah but it's still the fact that

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,460
you cannot get close to the portability

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,230
and availability every word with any

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,400
other language and you can we see and I

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,530
think that has been part of the

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,020
popularity that you can build this for

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,750
basically any operating system and any

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,360
CPU can you can think of at least if it

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,580
is CPU has 32 bits or more and you can

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,530
run curl on it and that's that's

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,910
powerful that means that you can write

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,710
your programs basically put it

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,920
everywhere and it'll still work the same

00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:27,570
and you slip curl the same way and then

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,730
of course we have I think we're like

00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,310
bindings for 45 languages so you can

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,770
pick your own language and we have

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:37,110
documentation the good thing I think

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,780
with maintaining the API over the years

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,030
is that we can maintain the

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,510
documentation the documentation

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:47,640
documents the same API yeah it's this

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,620
instability and it has a lot of

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,600
protocols it turns out that you should

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,570
actually use more than one protocol when

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,240
they do internet transfers so we try to

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,130
ask our users like roughly nearly how

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,630
many protocols do you actually use we'd

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,340
curve because it's sometimes it seems

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,470
ridiculous to keep supporting all these

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,460
weird protocols why would we do that

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,320
but it turns out that users are actually

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:15,330
very keen on using many protocols in

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:19,230
their in their code it's C code it's

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:22,710
really only there to transfer stuff it

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,020
is very fast it's usually as fast as you

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,820
can get I mean apart from the network

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,820
being a slow bottleneck often

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,990
since we're talking about all these

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,390
embedded devices most of them have

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,919
gotten the carb source code they built

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,210
it for their device and they're running

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,030
with it that also means that they're

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,679
sort of they they enjoy having things

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,559
like you know disabling features they

00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,000
don't want in their car or TV and so

00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,020
they can usually shave off size and

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,120
features they don't like or don't want

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:59,780
and we have an how many TLS libraries

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,460
can you mention when you get up in the

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:06,309
morning we support 12 TLS libraries and

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,059
that's a hard challenge to you just

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:12,950
mention all of them it's also sort of an

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,270
this also goes with it it makes it

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,650
really attractive for all these device

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,690
manufacturers because they usually

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,059
prefer one of the libraries and they

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,890
won't have the small one or the feature

00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,230
full one or the one that goes with the

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,470
best license or whatever and it makes it

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,480
really handy for all of these to pick

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:35,809
the one you want build curve with it'll

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:38,450
just fly and okay I mean where trust

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,100
them so maybe why anyone would do

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,960
anything open-source isn't really a

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,039
surprise to you and we're all sort of

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,450
yeah of course it would be able to

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:50,120
source but I still want to just first

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,690
iterate over this that I get this a lot

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,330
when I tell someone you know yeah

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,669
billions of devices cool right and why

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,100
would you I do that open source if if if

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:03,230
I got just a tiny amount of money for

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,870
every installation right I would be a

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,190
millionaire or whatever but you all know

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,600
that it doesn't work like that and it

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,549
was never an alternative and it had

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,710
never been anything near whether you say

00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,890
see I mean I haven't done this myself

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,289
and I always enjoyed sort of the

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,940
atmosphere of open-source I appreciated

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,289
the day I learned about it and I always

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,299
wanted to contribute back and it's

00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,059
always been like that and it's always

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,280
been a team effort and now I wouldn't be

00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:31,760
rich anyway

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,640
so that's basically sort of what it is

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:40,610
and I just want to explain a little bit

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:43,910
about how this is done then we're a

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,610
small project we were never big we're

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,200
still small but counted together if you

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,330
accumulate over the years we have

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,180
roughly 1500 names in this sort of thank

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:56,440
you file which is a lot of names most of

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,180
all helpers or contributors that have

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,190
contributed something like once and

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,570
never came back and that's fine but

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,970
they're still in there so we have about

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,270
30 to 40 contributors per release and we

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,760
do releases every eight weeks so every

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:23,060
other month we're really really small

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:27,340
for team possibly five so and we're all

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:29,600
volunteers there's no particular

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,120
commercial backing here there's no big

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,580
company there's no there's really no

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,890
money at all mo and we're of course

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,630
we're doing things like you know opus or

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:43,160
style everything is publican we have

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:46,150
mailing lists and right we're on on

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,150
github these days

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:03,600
so what I usually when when I try to it

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,370
goes back to little that you know and

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,370
you know I'm not a millionaire I don't

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,110
give money for this trying to explain

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,580
this to an outsider yeah yeah but okay

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,500
but who pays for all of this right

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,750
there's some happen to be some

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,980
organization there's there's a lot of

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,680
code all those devices are running

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,800
Carwood who sets this up and what's the

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,780
organizational charge and everything but

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,280
we're we're a bunch of spare time

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,280
hackers it's never change

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,700
well these days I Mac you know I'm

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,540
employed by Mozilla and I get to spend a

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,820
part of my work time on Carl so that is

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,340
to some extent company backing but apart

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,059
from that we're all just doing it on her

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,679
our spare times I'm sure that we have a

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:49,559
lot of contributors who are actually

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,590
doing I mean they're using curl at work

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,309
and fix bugs or add features for their

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,570
employers and send them back to us but I

00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,460
don't know and we don't keep track about

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,400
in the reserves saurabh they're not

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,160
really affecting the the trajectory of

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,720
the project or anything we've had a few

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,940
companies over the years who actually

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,670
through sort of step up and pay someone

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,280
to work on a feature I implemented SFTP

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,890
and SCP support for by combo for a

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,140
company who said we'll pay for your time

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,210
I worked on a shippi to support a while

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,610
ago also like that the company stepped

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:29,070
up and say I will pay your work time for

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:31,800
awhile if you do this that's fine but

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,559
really if you want to have in this sort

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,150
of scenario companies only pay for

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,770
feature development there's nobody's

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,040
going to step up but hey we'll pay you

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:44,630
for fixing bugs for a year no that

00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,630
doesn't happen now hasn't happened yet

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,090
right but basically so how do you you'd

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,820
write software that get used by a

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,100
billion people or more it's it's there's

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,730
nothing magic to this at all

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,770
it is plain old simple software

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:12,800
engineering you just have to write

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:16,720
something it should be a bit useful you

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:20,570
know review that's good

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,460
test it write some decent documentation

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,580
documentation is you know we all know

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,900
this but it's still not as common as we

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,780
would like it to be but it's really are

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,010
useful and important to get it to get

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,510
something popular it needs to be

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,280
understood and you can just do it you

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,980
need to document it and then we release

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,690
often and then we start over again and

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,620
you just it's rate like that for a long

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:46,790
long time and it'll be a success in the

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:53,000
end hopefully well that's how it worked

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:55,370
out for us so and when okay billions of

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,500
devices you all have like three devices

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:04,060
running my code

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:04,060
do you trust it really or

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:12,230
will curl give us the next heartbleed

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,890
sort of yeah yeah that's same well

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,750
roughly the same code in many many many

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,169
many places what happens when you

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:25,190
someone figures out the way to trigger

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:31,570
some nastiness in vast amount of devices

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:37,010
I wouldn't be too fun so yeah right I

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,840
hope but what do I know I'm just wanting

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:43,399
to mention that we're of course aware of

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,860
the situation sort of it there's some

00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:49,549
sense of responsibility sort of that

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,020
yeah one who once you have when you have

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,000
just a few users you know you could just

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,130
do another release tomorrow or next week

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,250
it's fine just upgrade everybody but

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,590
suddenly when you're sort of letting

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:07,760
this whole billions of devices really

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:10,700
sink in devices so we're of course doing

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,730
reviews we review it as much as possible

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:17,720
I can't say that we review every single

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:20,240
commit but a lot of them and we learn

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,770
that having strict guidelines on code

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,779
style has turned out to be really useful

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,980
so we're sort of over time we're being

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:26,240
more and more strict that you should

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,419
follow the coast Isle it doesn't matter

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,480
if you like it or not having a common

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:35,450
stylus helps for readability for

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,130
security and for understanding things so

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,840
that's what we're going for

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,130
and of course documentation so we should

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,539
document everything so that you actually

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,279
understand what you're doing when you're

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:46,220
changing things and why you would change

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,110
things and and and perhaps you would

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,539
understand api's properly when you're

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,549
using them students inadvertently cause

00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,049
problems like that and we test as much

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:58,070
as possible testing is of course always

00:26:54,049 --> 00:27:01,880
hard we use valgrind as much as possible

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:04,950
on tests we do we do start the code

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,900
analyzing as

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:13,890
as much as we can I would say we use

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:17,140
Coverity and we use clang analyzer a lot

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,180
yeah and be part of that the Google OSS

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,130
fasting project now and we're doing some

00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,190
other manifestations of it starting with

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,250
that and we just recently had a code or

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,440
date by the Mozilla open source secure

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:33,490
software refer to whatever is called the

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,250
M OSS and that's a great effort by the

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,310
way they so we got a grant and they

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,830
could pay a company a lot of money to

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,960
spend a lot of time reading curl source

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,430
code and they found a lot of problems

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,620
and reported them back and we fix them

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:50,230
and hopefully we learned something from

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,070
that and we try to not to reproduce the

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,070
same problems in the future

00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:02,830
let's hope that works

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:07,270
nah I think you'll do right so that's

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,010
what we do in order to fix or rather

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,220
make sure that we don't get a lot of

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:16,150
problems because right we have right now

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:18,160
60 CVS I think and Counting I'm sure

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,480
that we will have more we have more in

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,280
the pipe but as always I don't think

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,870
anyone should ever judge a project by

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,060
the number of CVS not only because we

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,310
have 60 but number of Seabees is never

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,290
an important calendar it's what you do

00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,960
with the CVS how you handle this that's

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,460
what's important you all know that and I

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,780
know that too and that's sort of what

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,980
we're trying to make in this project

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,360
just make sure that we have to take care

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:46,420
of those the best possible way so I just

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:52,060
wanted to sort of make it more about me

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:54,520
then so Carl started when Kurt wasn't

00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,050
really the I mean Carl was the third

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,360
name of the project so it started in

00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,540
1998 as Carl so I've been doing this for

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,540
a while

00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:07,970
it has sort of sort of marked my entire

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,470
life

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:14,520
this is my primary hobby this is what I

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,040
do sometimes when I when people report

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,190
problems or they say this sucks

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,680
and then I said no and they say well you

00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,350
shouldn't take it as personal and then

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,660
this then it feels of course it's

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:32,880
personal I just told you I spent 20

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:36,230
years on this 20 years and I work on

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,540
this two hours every day roughly

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,790
sometimes more sometimes little less two

00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:49,620
hours per day in 20 years

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:53,970
right that's yeah I guess I get to work

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:57,420
extra much extra uncurl houses mozilla

00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:01,320
pays me for it as well so sort of just

00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:06,450
accumulating this I spent a lot of time

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,610
on this so possibly that is part of

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,000
explanation why I actually sort of got

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,740
somewhere by now and I must say that

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,990
looking at ways that feels good that at

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,950
least those 14,000 hours wasn't

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:29,640
completely wasted most of those emails

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:33,060
probably okay but so then people tend to

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,170
ask me you okay them but why why keep up

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,890
with been doing this for 20 years right

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,990
but

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:45,010
I really cannot put the finger on it

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,970
anyone in any way other than yes just so

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,250
much fun you know

00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,200
believers is something and and making

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,210
sure that it works and people appreciate

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,280
it and it just runs everywhere

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,770
that's an awful I'm sorry that's an

00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,870
awesome feeling and you real yeah and

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,610
then someone reports a bag yeah we can't

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,520
have that and then we continue on

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,170
someone answer feature struck me that we

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,120
really need another feature and we add

00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,960
that and we are the bug we need to fix

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,549
that and that's just how it is we just

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,090
move on like every other project it

00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:22,059
never ends and right everyone needs a

00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:25,299
hobby right but because I often get the

00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:27,730
question right 14,000 hours right that's

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,710
a complete waste because what if you had

00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,410
gotten just a little little hourly rate

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:35,679
on that time you would earn a lot of

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,950
money but but I try to get the focus

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,929
back on this being a hobby most of most

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,410
people at least in sort of in work in

00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:45,970
our sort of Western world most people

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,280
have some sort of hobby you spend time

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,480
you go golfing your go canoeing or you

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,179
go walking in the woods

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,770
that's hobbies right that's also Hobbit

00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:57,610
you just spend a lot of time in front of

00:31:53,770 --> 00:32:02,040
a computer and writing curve so yeah

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,040
it's just the most fun I can imagine

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,160
right and then when I've explained that

00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:12,160
they look at me a bit weird so yeah yeah

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,450
yeah you're a strange person anyway so

00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:19,720
but seriously isn't it ever done right

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,309
20 years and it's just the command-line

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,260
tool right and then a lot of people tell

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:25,450
me that yeah I used to call command-line

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,340
tool in 2005 the first time or something

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,559
like that and still works the same wait

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,130
wait you can use the same options you

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:35,530
use them they work now what happened did

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:38,580
you spend 15 more years from making

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,580
those same options work

00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,960
not exactly but yeah if he's like that

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:49,110
sometimes but anyway we're of course

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,340
always having heading forward upwards

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:56,310
onwards and since we're celebrating

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,160
actually 19 years as a project in a

00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:03,180
month we're actually having our first

00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:06,290
curl meetup meeting in the real world in

00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,770
Germany in March so if you're into Karl

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,760
check it out

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:14,760
but other things than happening apart

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,730
from us meeting in Germany there's a

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,730
future for for curl because no it's

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,620
never really never done it's never

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,410
completed it's never finished there are

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,690
always bugs and as you know the internet

00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,900
didn't really stop at any point during

00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:34,650
these 20 years so the internet is keep

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:36,750
is keeping up I mean it keeps changing

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,400
it keeps evolving and we need to keep

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,470
evolving with that too in order to sort

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,330
of work the way the rest of the Internet

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,370
does and make sure that everyone can do

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,730
what they what they want to do on the

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,380
current internet and the future internet

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,180
things like new protocol versions and

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,900
new ways to do things and better ways to

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,030
use compressions and blah blah blah I

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,370
mean we introduced a cheapy to a few

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:04,100
years ago we're going to introduce the

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,100
next protocols as soon as possible

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,300
4:13 mozilla room i'll tell you

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:12,300
something about the next verticals and

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:19,119
of course this is open source

00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,980
it'll just survive and it'll keep

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,540
iterating it doesn't matter if I get run

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,819
over by the bus tomorrow or just get

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,490
bored and just go home it'll be there

00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:32,079
he'll still iterate so it doesn't this

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:34,869
doesn't sort of depend on me and there's

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,579
truly no slowdown in sight if you're

00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,440
looking at sort of commit traits or line

00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:41,589
of cut lines of code or anything it's

00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,770
just going and going and going and of

00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:46,950
course you can help just joining and fix

00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,510
the bugs

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:52,869
so I wanted to show you then a little

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,579
peek of our roadmap going forward so

00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:59,369
this is sort of where how the magic is

00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:59,369
made in this project there this

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,530
now the secret is out right

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:14,840
[Applause]

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,619
so we have quite a lot of time I talk so

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,450
fast or so little or whatever it is so

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:40,309
if you have any questions there are some

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:42,500
mics or one mic a taste or something hi

00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:46,220
thanks for talking have you ever been

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,130
approached by a government agency or any

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:54,349
other organization to build a back door

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:59,960
into curl thank you for that lovely

00:35:54,349 --> 00:36:01,730
question if I had been contacted by a

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,849
good foreign government to insert

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,849
backdoors in my code how would you know

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:15,250
but if they had approached me I wouldn't

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:17,050
tell you anyway right so I myself just

00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:25,000
to meet you you go and review the code

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:27,250
and tell me if you find it out well no I

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,680
have not I have not been approached by a

00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:34,540
government or company or anyone to do

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,910
anything of any sort of bad faith in not

00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:41,430
in the code and not using the code in

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:46,510
any way actually we are all friendly

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:49,020
most hello does anyone still use his

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,020
gopher

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:56,540
i but i every year when I ask this

00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,130
question to curl users what are you

00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,809
using in curl I asked them what

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,300
protocols are you using in curve and

00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:05,599
there are always people marking that

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,250
gopher and it makes me curious if

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,140
they're actually marking the gopher

00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,510
because they're using it or because they

00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:15,109
think I should keep it so I'm not sure

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:17,089
but actually last time they gopher was

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:22,640
not the least used protocol out of the

00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:24,890
protocols we support so I guess kind of

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,420
following on from that about all the

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,730
protocols you had to implement which

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,339
would you say you spent the most time on

00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:36,880
it or has been the most difficult and I

00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:39,050
guess second part why is that Samba and

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,780
serve all the protocols that you've had

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,829
to implement as part the coal project

00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,839
which would you say you've spent the

00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:51,079
most time on which is taken the longest

00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:55,180
to implement the longest the longest to

00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,180
write support for the longest disappear

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,440
yeah I mean none of them ever stops

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,410
being supported and none of them really

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,630
stops being developed so I think all

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:12,440
protocols that are the most used they're

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,090
also sort of most abused or most most

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,720
different flavors of them in the world

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,880
so like trying to support HTTP that's a

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,530
never ending game and that'll never stop

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,450
and it will never be fully compliant

00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,180
with everything in the world so so I'm

00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:28,460
not sure that we ever stopped developing

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,320
sort of the HP support is going to be

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,970
forever so if I was going to name one

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,980
protocol that is the hardest to support

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:39,260
that is I should be because it's a it's

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:44,750
a Wild West to support it hi thank you

00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:52,070
for lib Carl do you think HTTP 2 will

00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:54,520
finally take over HTTP everywhere I'll

00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:59,870
talk about that in Mozilla room but yeah

00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:02,630
HTTP 2 is as it was made by the

00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:05,030
browser's only supporting s52 over HTTP

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,740
that is encrypted and if you're looking

00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,210
at if you're counting traffic in

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,430
checking with Firefox records today

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,130
actually more than half of all the

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:16,160
connections over HTTP is using it to be

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,680
too so it is already at least on its way

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,200
towards that I don't think it'll ever

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,290
truly reach a hundred percent because it

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,820
should be one and even I mean I should

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,770
be one at one and HP don't want to zero

00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,400
is going to remain in servers for a very

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:35,870
very long time but there will also be

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:38,810
new contenders after HTTP 2 so maybe HTP

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,280
two will only be here for a period of

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:45,890
time until the next one

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:48,590
the places that you be - ok hypothetical

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:52,310
situation the last license with your

00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:54,350
name in it has just been written what

00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,270
year is it and why is no-one using girl

00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,920
anymore

00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,870
sorry just just I'm asking you to

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,670
predict the death of Carl why like under

00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,620
what circumstances will someone will

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,620
will curl not be used anymore

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:18,300
I can't hear the question sorry Wyatt

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:20,760
like why will like what what would cause

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,310
Carlton no longer be used like its own

00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,890
billion devices why would it stop being

00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,320
used ever is it because a new tool comes

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,300
along it is it because you are like no

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,190
longer supporting it like there are

00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,430
massive open-source project what causes

00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:39,060
it to die that's a really good question

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:44,220
and I think it's sort of as I never

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:48,270
really understood why you took off it's

00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,070
like I don't know but I would imagine it

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,410
that if I just listen in to what people

00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,630
are saying than people I mean the

00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,610
constant mantra I get in my face every

00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,410
time I say something about Lib Cardiff

00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,810
yeah it's written in C right buffer

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,030
overflows bad bad bad so someone would

00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,400
would say that yeah the future of the

00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,500
lib curl like would be another language

00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,060
that would be a safe language and then

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,150
everything would be grand and much

00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,830
better you can hear from my voice that I

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:16,920
don't really believe in that but maybe

00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:20,700
maybe that'll be what challenged it and

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,160
replaces it eventually it's really hard

00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,900
to tell because I'm the ones are using

00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,090
it today they're using it for a reason

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,970
and maybe those will fail for some

00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,680
reason and some other devices or

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,300
manufactures will suddenly pick up

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,430
something else and become much bigger I

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,920
don't know it's really hard to tell and

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,570
for me it doesn't really matter I'll

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,230
just run this for as long as I think

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,720
it's fun

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,960
maybe I'll get bored of it someday maybe

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,350
I'm not but and maybe I mean it is good

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,690
with competitors so it's fine as long as

00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,400
we should have many many competitors

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,860
that wouldn't be good for the ecosystem

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,670
so fine may make more competitors

00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,670
that'll be great

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,849
I thanks for the talk all those devices

00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:09,430
with your code in many many of them

00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:11,109
never could be updated and so there's

00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:16,869
gonna be bugs and maybe some serious

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:19,569
ones how do you feel about that yeah we

00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:21,309
have that's a sort of a major problem I

00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,859
think in the project that we have some

00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:26,079
of these producers and of devices they

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:28,809
have really really really long upgrade

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,670
cycles like decades sometimes someone

00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:32,710
shows up on the mailing list and asks us

00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:36,539
about hey I have a bug in this version

00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:38,890
all right we release that 14 years ago

00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:44,950
no no we don't want to update we just

00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:47,380
want the fix so yeah but I don't think I

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,499
mean I think that's a pity and I think

00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,910
that sort of it's drains our resources

00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:54,309
and everything because I think yeah

00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:59,470
we've fixed like we fix on average I

00:42:54,309 --> 00:43:03,069
think about 400 bugs every year like 10

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:06,279
years right that you have in your code

00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:08,170
you should upgrade so I don't know I

00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:10,960
can't really affect that I can only

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:15,099
suggest to them that they may be upgrade

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,079
sooner or consider this but I also think

00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:20,230
it sort of drives in the other direction

00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,970
as well again if you ever want to have

00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:26,079
some fun you should follow me on Twitter

00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,960
and discuss your L syntax that is sort

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,839
of a thing that since we have devices

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,880
using the internet with very very long

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,180
update cycles we also need things to

00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,569
actually be somewhat stable URLs

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,970
shouldn't change over time this URL we

00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:44,559
have today should work in ten years as

00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,480
long as the servers and everything is

00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,849
there the syntax to then change the

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,220
protocol that the things we do today

00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:53,579
they should still work even in the

00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,579
future

00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:00,760
I talking about command line

00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,910
applications rather than the library

00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,530
what do you think of w get and do you

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,530
think it does anything better than Co I

00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:14,920
like to maintain the image that we're in

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:19,870
a fierce struggle sort of the curl w get

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,730
worse w yet is an excellent command line

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,550
to forgetting things of the internet

00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:26,890
using a bunch of those at least two

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,260
protocols that curl also supports and it

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,060
does a lot of other things so I think

00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,910
the W get is a great project and a great

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,090
tool everyone should use it it has a

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,560
small overlap in features with Carl but

00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,170
looking at what both projects can do

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,450
that overlap isn't particularly large so

00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,070
by all means use whatever tool you would

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:50,700
like the best tool for the job

00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:53,470
or like hi thank you for the code okay

00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:57,970
if you had to start over like from the

00:44:53,470 --> 00:45:00,360
beginning with just a blank draft we do

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:03,190
something better or just something

00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:06,370
marginally better than the current curve

00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:09,340
because you said that there's like 50000

00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:13,980
commits something like that and it's

00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:17,290
it's very huge and I can think of so big

00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,150
huge codebase without you know some

00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,610
design flow you want to fix or something

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,520
that you let him you cut and you never

00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:27,190
fix it because it just worked which is

00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,680
do you want to have like starts all over

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,520
again and do something better or is not

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,460
just not possible

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:38,290
I mean engineer is always attractive to

00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,600
consider the case yeah yeah throw out

00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:43,270
the rubbish just sort of clean plate and

00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:46,420
build a new nice house the way we see it

00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:48,280
now that should work but but I always

00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,340
resist that because I don't think that

00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,770
is a very long-term solution

00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,180
everything is gonna be iterative all the

00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,550
time so even if I would rewrite

00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,710
everything today it would still be an

00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,930
iterative process in years time so I

00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,610
don't really ever consider throwing

00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,319
everything out and starting over I'm

00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,559
always in Polish

00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:10,390
what we have making sure that we change

00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,759
things so that it becomes better without

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,599
rewriting everything from scratch so

00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:20,019
it's really for me it's more of a no I

00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:26,430
would never start over that's basically

00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:28,660
not going to happen but so did we do

00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,789
decisions in the beginning and and

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,249
things that were stupid that we're

00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:36,549
suffering from today yes with it and

00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:37,749
maybe a bunch of those decisions and the

00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,949
choices we should have done it

00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:42,549
differently and we would have been

00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:45,910
happier today but yeah but who doesn't

00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:47,589
I mean who don't do stupid decisions

00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,509
through life right we just have to live

00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,249
with them and sort of make up for them

00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:56,940
over time and it tends to work out

00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:56,940
anyway Thanks

00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,790
no more questions

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,970
4:30 in the Mozilla

00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:19,160
thank you

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:19,160
