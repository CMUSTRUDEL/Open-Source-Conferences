Description: 
	Ethics in Network Measurements  Moral obligations of engineers, scientists and hackers, based on example of RIPE Atlas 
by Vesna Manojlovic

At: FOSDEM 2017

When designing technologies, networked systems, and measurements on theInternet, we must be aware of their implications and consequences for thesociety and participants. As engineers, scientists, programmers and otherexperts, we have moral obligations towards our peers, users of technologies wecreate, and the wider communities.

In this talk I want to talk both about general ethical considerations, andspecific examples of moral dilemmas that come from building the RIPE Atlassystem, and conducting measurements that reveal workings of Internetinfrastructure and services.

RIPE Atlas is an extensive measurement network, where the vantage points(sources of measurements) are hosted by volunteers: mostly individuals athome, but also some institutions (ISPs, IXPs, academia, various otherbusinesses). RIPE Atlas users are using someone else's Internet connection todo measurements. In order to recognise ethical considerations surrounding useof RIPE Atlas, we looked both into the historical considerations of engineersand scientists, and into practical constraints users should keep in mind, andwe published some findings in this article:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/kistel/ethics-of-ripe-atlas-measurements

	00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:16,169
speaker will be vestment talking about

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:20,490
ethics in internet measurements hi

00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:25,710
everyone I'm Vesna and I'm an techno

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:29,509
addict so as Community Builder

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,080
at ripe ncc and as a hacker I'm

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:38,070
committed to questioning the values that

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:49,100
we built into our communities and into

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:52,010
our technologies technical is political

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,589
technology is not politically neutral

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,769
every time when we make a technical

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:01,140
decision for design of our software of

00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,470
our systems of our Hardware those

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,450
decisions have consequences

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,409
they have social consequences because

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:15,179
they influence the distribution of power

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,820
and privilege in the society and the

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:21,299
values and the points of view that we

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:27,929
that we have that we use in making those

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:31,109
decisions reflect our ethics as hackers

00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:35,219
we used to be on the margins of the

00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:39,859
society but since the Internet has

00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:44,520
become more important in the life of a

00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:48,240
lot of people users normal people

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,630
everyday people now we as hackers also

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,179
have gained much more considerable power

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,770
and now we have the responsibility to

00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,770
use that power for good

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:09,700
but what is good so as as a young

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,670
scientist as a young engineer as a young

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:16,210
hacker I used to believe that the

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:22,720
Internet is making the world a better

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:26,980
place and now 20 years later I'm afraid

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:32,980
that the Internet is actually helping to

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:36,970
destroy the world so I have been kind of

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:40,810
thorn between this bright side of the

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:44,200
symbol where I've been thinking about

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,710
the Utopia that we are going to bring to

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,970
the world and had this technology missed

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:55,420
point of view and the more dystopian

00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,120
visions and the more techno pessimistic

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:03,459
point of view as of recently and then I

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:09,010
started studying ethics which is this

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:12,700
area in the middle it's this gray line

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,830
is this gray area on the edges of these

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,590
decisions and the edges of these areas

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,440
and this is how I try to help to

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:25,930
visualize it to myself and try to

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,690
present it to you in this talk so this

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,540
talk is going to have three parts first

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:35,770
of all I'm going to introduce the ethics

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,260
and the dilemmas in the science and with

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,630
which areas of the sciences had to deal

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,570
with these moral dilemmas in the past

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,170
and currently then I'm going to explain

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,180
on the example of ripe Atlas how we have

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,070
dealt with these ethical dilemmas and

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,590
then finally I'm going to talk about the

00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:00,550
predictions for the future or advice and

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:05,110
tips for how we can go beyond technology

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:08,140
and only the one of these parts is

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,490
actually what I do for my work so the

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,440
first part and the last part are more

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,750
thing that I'm passionate about in my

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,120
free time so we will also see the

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,940
difference between the quality in the

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,850
preparedness and the fact that I have

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,030
for this talk but I have been studying

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,950
these other areas a lot and a lot of

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:34,640
material is available to you in the

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:37,550
notes the definition of ethics is a

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,970
branch of philosophy which is studying

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:44,780
what is good and what is evil so this is

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,090
actually very important for for my way

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,160
of thinking of how can we approach the

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,370
the Internet and the development of the

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,640
technologies and so since I'm not a

00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:00,890
social scientist I went and read the

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:03,860
paper by by a group of people who went

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,310
into a workshop which was then produced

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,980
results called philosophy meets Internet

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,110
engineering and a lot of these

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,330
conclusions are based on on such a paper

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,210
and this is very good my introduction to

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,920
the practical ethics and so in this

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:25,540
paper it says there are three major ways

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,490
of looking into ethical considerations

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:33,020
consequentialism the ontology and virtue

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:37,370
ethics and translated to kind of a

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:41,800
five-year-old language is the first one

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,400
it means the first one is the ends

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,510
justify the means

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,280
so if the the consequences are good then

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:55,640
it's okay it's fine we are doing fine

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,830
the ontology is the opposite it says the

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,990
means should be good the means should be

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,540
moral and then the consequences don't

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,240
really matter we can kind of disregard

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,500
what the actual effects are and the

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,830
third one says if the actors are good if

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,840
you are a good person then whatever you

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,320
do whichever means you use of whatever

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,900
the consequences are are going to be

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,960
okay because they

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,610
have been created by a good person so

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,800
you only have to make sure that you're a

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,080
virtuous person now all of these

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,900
approaches have their pros and cons and

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,330
it's kind of difficult to implement them

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,389
in practice so there are three ways to

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:44,949
combine them the principle is implore

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:48,160
ilysm and casuistry and the principle

00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,500
ISM is mostly used with research of the

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,440
human subjects and it says well make

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,919
sure that you are respecting these major

00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,039
principles the pluralism says use

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,240
multiple of these methods and combine

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:07,660
them and try to get the best of both of

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,580
all three and three says well let's look

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,590
at the things in case to case basis less

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,510
than B so theoretical as just look at

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,880
these examples that we have and maybe

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,000
the similar examples from the past and

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,880
make decisions in case to case basis so

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,740
all of these can be applied to the

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,070
internet research if we look at the

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,410
science from the neutral point of view

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,889
then we can look at these categories of

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,770
sciences and we get the life sciences

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,169
and the formal and physical and so on

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,909
and then there is applied sciences which

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,330
is mostly the technology that we are

00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:52,360
concerned with like engineering computer

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:54,190
science and all of them have ways of

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,590
looking at them from the techni up

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,289
Tamizh and techno pessimist point of

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,409
view so the optimists say science is

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:07,000
wonderful it's improving our lives it's

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:10,060
progress it's bringing the advantages to

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,520
all of us while the pessimists look at

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,099
the darker sides and so they're always

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,970
in all of them dilemmas that people had

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:22,050
to deal with for example nuclear

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,880
scientists they had to ask themselves

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,280
should we take part in developing the

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,889
atomic bomb

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,980
we think that nuclear energy is

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:35,340
beneficial or other more dangers and how

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,260
do we balance this the similar thing for

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,400
the medical science is of course their

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:44,810
advantages but you there has been a lot

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,880
of ethical and moral dilemmas for the

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,800
medical practitioners and then there is

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,920
environmental movement that brought up

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,430
ethics ethical questions in the usages

00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,120
of pesticides and fertilizers and so

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,580
these are some of the examples and some

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,089
now we come to the examples closer to us

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,580
from the Computer Sciences so then there

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,339
is cryptography and artificial

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,760
intelligence where the robots can

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:18,570
actually bring us a lot of help but they

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,120
can also kill people you can get

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,030
cryptography for enhancing the privacy

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,120
or there it can be used for surveillance

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,520
and then you can use the databases to

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,339
track people based on certain categories

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,490
and then the networking so I will talk

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:39,450
mostly about networking in the the next

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:42,570
slide and there is also a programming

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,540
side of the Computer Sciences so here I

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,940
don't really have to tell you and force

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,530
them about the free software but I had

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,500
to include it into the slides for the

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,230
completeness so you could use the

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,040
programming for freedom or you can use

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,400
it for profit

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,950
and this also expresses your ethical

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,950
values and it also embeds the ethical

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:09,900
values in the software and how can it be

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:13,070
used further so in this way the the code

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,070
is politics

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:24,230
and now for hackers

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:28,399
so the hackers has been seen as those

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,489
people who are using technology in the

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,529
unconventional way so in the playful way

00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:36,139
in the creative way or even in the

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:39,499
disruptive way so in that sense the

00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:42,199
hackers have a very dialectic

00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:47,989
relationship with the technology on one

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:50,629
hand the more tech the more material for

00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:53,420
the hackers to hack and to play with on

00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:55,069
the other hand since they try to break

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,329
it and try to use it for the

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:01,489
unconventional purposes they discover

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:03,499
vulnerabilities they discover the holes

00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:06,470
they discover different ways in which

00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:08,720
technology can be used but then that

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,720
gets incorporated into the mainstream

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,839
technology again and then it gets used

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,790
for the mainstream goals the ones that

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,519
hackers didn't intend it to so there is

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,919
always this kind of power struggle

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,269
between the hackers and the mainstream

00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:28,730
scientists and the technologists and the

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,819
ethical side of the hacking has been

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,009
documented very well

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:36,290
this is just one of the examples there

00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:39,079
are other ways to look at it so the

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:45,339
sharing and openness and freedom have

00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:50,029
been embedded into the ethics of hackers

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:52,970
and still this is a very positive istic

00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,709
view so in the last part of the of this

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,369
presentation I will come back to this

00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:01,249
and see how how these hackers ethics can

00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:06,230
actually be used on itself to question

00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:08,540
its own premises so the hackers ethics

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,059
is very much connected with the early

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,220
days of the internet where the internet

00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:15,649
was also supposed to bring us all the

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,579
freedom and to connect us to each other

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:21,559
to enable communication so that people

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:23,260
are going to get greater understanding

00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,060
of each other and so the

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,550
conflicts can be avoided if we would all

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,110
be able to talk to to each other it's

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,930
going to bring the freedom and the

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,400
democracy and to liberate us all this is

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:40,510
a very technical acquaint view but in

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,210
the recent years there have been other

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,730
sides of Internet technologies revealed

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,770
and what do the techno pessimists sieve

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:53,650
and they look at the internet nowadays

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:58,180
well there is the huge usage of energy

00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:00,550
which also includes the usage of fossil

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:05,230
fuels and all the consequences that come

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:09,250
from that there is the exploitation of

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,560
the people who are creating and building

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,930
the Internet so the people who have to

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,300
mine for the resources to build all of

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,700
the equipment and the people who

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,990
actually build our equipment and then

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:28,170
there is the pollution of the

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:31,420
environment the Internet can help us to

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,870
delete our differences but it actually

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,760
also increases the differences and

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,670
deepens the digital divide while if the

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,470
first world gets the clouds and the

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,030
shiny data centers the third world

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,970
children have to work in the mines and

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:53,490
have to pick through our electronic

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:57,100
waste so this is another way to look at

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,080
the effects of the technology then there

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,130
is surveillance I won't even go into

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,260
this because this has actually been kind

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:09,070
of predicted by the philosophers of

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:13,180
Technology in the 80s where they said

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:16,810
that if a government would ask us to

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:21,430
carry a device which can reveal our

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:23,620
location at all times and it can listen

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,420
to our conversations it can take

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,100
photographs and then share them with

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:33,900
authorities we would refuse that we

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,630
would even revolt against such an idea

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,710
if it would have been brought from the

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:43,470
on the political grounds but if it is

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,960
presented to us as technical innovation

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:52,610
well we all have mobile phones nowadays

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:57,029
so this is also something to think about

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,900
how else is the political connected with

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,960
the Internet

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,779
well there is Internet governance but

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,480
this is much larger topic I can talk

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:08,460
about this for for an hour and you will

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,740
probably have to come to shot to the

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:17,400
next Dutch hackers came to hear me talk

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:20,610
about this so Internet in order to

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,910
determine how the internet functions we

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,160
need to perform the measurements now we

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,430
attack is via engineers of course we can

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,160
do measurements we know how to do this

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:34,290
but the measurements on the Internet are

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,310
not only a technical problem anymore

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:43,290
because the Internet has become this

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:45,930
whole social technical system we do have

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,959
to consider other things when conducting

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,029
internet measurements now and so this is

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,400
why now the internet engineers and the

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,650
software developers and the researchers

00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,959
have to busied themselves with studying

00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:04,410
things like ethics so since we are more

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,290
knowledgeable than the users that we are

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,870
conducting these experiments on we have

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,380
the responsibilities towards them so we

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:16,560
have to explain to them what information

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,670
are they sharing with us what kind of

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,150
impact can debt have and we have to get

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,670
their consent but not just for them to

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,790
click on the terms of services we have

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,200
to get their meaningful informed consent

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,839
they have to understand what they are

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,589
signing if there if they are agreeing to

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,990
that so that's one thing so we have to

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,820
deal with with people and even when

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,600
designing the experiments we have to

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,660
wait the Ben

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,180
it's for us and the costs that are

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,790
probably not going to be borne by us but

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,290
by somebody else so for this we have to

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,600
consider all these ethical

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,690
considerations that have been talking

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,209
about and there is a helpful graph for

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,730
this so if you are going to do the the

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,020
measurements on the Internet the papers

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,929
that are referenced in my slides

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,610
actually cover this this is one of the

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:16,020
diagrams that you can that you can

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:21,449
follow okay so this was kind of the

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:27,750
preparation for the example now how many

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:29,970
of you have heard about ripe ncc great

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,730
how many of you have heard about ripe

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,059
apples before it's kind of the same

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,559
people and it's almost two thirds but I

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:44,960
have to do this very short introduction

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:47,789
so ripe ncc is one of the internet

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,169
registries regional internet registry

00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:54,780
for europe middle east and former Soviet

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:57,210
republics so this yellow part on the on

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,130
the slide and there is four more

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:07,950
regional internet registries and so we

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:09,840
embed the ethics in our work in a way

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,559
that we are all not-for-profit

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,650
organizations we are all open and

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:20,190
transparent via neutral and we are

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:23,250
governed by the communities by our

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:29,039
members and we are accountable to these

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:31,679
members to these communities one of the

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,830
main jobs of the regional internet

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,549
registry and reppin cc2 is to distribute

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,860
IP addresses so we distribute them in

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:42,059
the hierarchical fashion we get them

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,419
from Ayana

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,070
and then we pass them on to local

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,400
internet registries which are mostly

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,320
Internet service providers corporations

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,990
banks governments so large or

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,820
that need a lot of addresses and then

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,730
they give them further to their

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,120
customers to the end users and I'm only

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,510
talking about ipv6 addresses because you

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,460
all know that this is the current

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:14,480
internet protocol and the other one is a

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:23,540
legacy one because there isn't any ipv4

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:25,490
left and yeah good so there are small

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,710
bits and pieces that you can still get

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,350
so there is one last block for every

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,800
member of the ripe NCC and that's it so

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:38,890
move on and get ipv6 I have to say this

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:42,350
it's not part of my talk so ripe Atlas

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:45,050
apart from from distributing these IP

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,210
addresses as a neutral organization ripe

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,330
NCC is also performing internet

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:54,770
measurements so we have this platform

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:59,570
for mapping the health of the Internet

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:01,700
and we do that by distributing small

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,360
hardware devices that are hosted by

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,850
volunteers these hardware devices

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,740
continuously do the ping traceroute and

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,480
DNS measurements towards critical

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,230
Internet infrastructure the root

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,500
nameservers

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,070
we can collect that information publish

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,200
it so it's all open data and we

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,300
visualize it as maps so that's why Atlas

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,660
so it's like a collection of maps about

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,480
the reach ability of critical

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,770
infrastructure on the Internet

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,680
so these devices perform measurements

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:40,790
for us and for the Internet community

00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:44,450
but they also can perform the

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:49,390
measurements for the other users of the

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:52,850
ripe Atlas system and so this is where

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,730
part of our ethical considerations come

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:59,300
into place because if you have one of

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,830
these things at home you allow 10,000

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:06,149
other people to do the measurements from

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,230
how's and you don't know them they are

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,450
not your friends

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,090
they are actually connected to you only

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,039
through through this platform so this is

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:18,179
what we had to have in mind when we were

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:23,519
designing the right path was the main

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:25,350
goal is to measure the health of the

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,970
infrastructure and to do the

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,970
troubleshooting and monitoring of your

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,049
own network but some people have been

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:36,450
using it for looking at for the

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,340
detection of the network interference

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,580
because that's also what happens like

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,049
some people block parts of the internet

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,720
deliberately sometimes there are outages

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,970
and so on so although that was not the

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,710
intended purpose for iPod plus some

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,130
researchers are actually using it for

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,990
that and they have taken into

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,529
consideration the fact that it wasn't

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,260
meant for that and in their paper they

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:03,389
actually have a large section about

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:07,649
ethical considerations so if you're

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:11,370
curious take a look at that one so how

00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:12,720
did we actually build all this into into

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,720
the design of the system at the

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,179
beginning so we have decided to not

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,389
measure bandwidth so we don't really

00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:24,240
look at your normal traffic we only

00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:29,130
generate extra traffic like pings and

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,950
trace routes and that is so that we can

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:36,840
claim that we don't have any access to

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,909
the users traffic that actually makes

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,600
the value of the measurements and of the

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:44,909
platform for certain purposes smaller

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,760
because people actually want the

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:50,789
bandwidth to be measured because they

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,320
don't realize that if you measure their

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,850
actual traffic you are going to

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,250
interfere with that you're going to make

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,860
it slower and you can actually look into

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:02,549
what is there so we decided not to do

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,070
that so that's one thing we only do

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:08,340
active measurements then all the data

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,050
that we collect is made public and it's

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,610
freely available

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:17,070
the api's that we use are also

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:20,040
documented and freely available there so

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,340
the source code of the measurements on

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,590
the probe is there on github and then

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:30,020
the tools that we provide and the tower

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:32,880
users right are also free software and

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,170
the the last thing that I want to

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,090
mention because then there are more

00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:40,440
things they are all published already

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:42,930
under on the FOSDEM interview page the

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,420
measurements that those probes do are

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,830
not freely configurable so you can only

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,410
do the measurements that are already

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,330
there which is paying traceroute dns as

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,390
a cell and so on you can't tell - the

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:57,510
probe or go and do this that that won't

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,790
work so we had deliberately limited the

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:04,740
number of features so that the dangers

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,480
to the users would be less we don't know

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,120
all those users but some of them have

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,340
cats and we really don't want to any

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,890
harm to come to those cats and this is

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,440
the auto photo of the of the probe

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,900
itself so you can see the the probe and

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,220
you can also get the mandatory cat

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,220
picture in a presentation

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:33,629
[Applause]

00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:35,850
so once we have come up with a system

00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:37,799
well it wasn't over we had to deal with

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,139
all kinds of questions later on

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,710
especially because we have a very

00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:46,980
critical community like you guys and so

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:50,460
people kept saying wait a minute what do

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,559
you mean you have to trust the code

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,480
which is on that probe you want me to

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,639
put a probe in my house but I can't

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,919
actually see what it does so yeah we had

00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:01,850
to release the source code there was a

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:07,049
talk about that last year it was them

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:09,169
then we wanted to make our life easier

00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,559
and to say okay all the measurements are

00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:16,350
public so we don't have to put a lot of

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:20,129
work in protecting the data that people

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:22,350
consider not public measurements and so

00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:25,799
we suggested that our community and they

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:28,309
didn't like it so we decided to actually

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,070
keep the feature of non public

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:34,919
measurements and so that that's still

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,019
there so if you are deploying some new

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,519
part of the data center whatever and you

00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,109
want to do the measurements to that

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,720
equipment but you don't want everybody

00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:44,730
to know immediately what the performance

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,580
is or whatever some of those

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,489
measurements can still be marked

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,499
non-public and they will be not easy to

00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:55,919
find through the Atmos system but that's

00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:57,720
why we don't call them private because

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:05,220
they're actually never going to be

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:09,149
private private then in 2015 we

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,789
introduced HTTP measurements but we also

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:14,399
kept them very limited they only can be

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:16,019
done towards so-called ripe Atlas

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:18,090
anchors which are part of our

00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,700
infrastructure and are controlled by us

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,769
so they cannot be performed by users to

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,019
random web sites on the Internet

00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:26,909
this is a way to protect the users

00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,609
especially in the countries with

00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:32,429
oppressive regimes where if you would go

00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:34,859
to a forbidden website then there would

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,740
be really harsh consequences for your

00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:40,909
life in real life

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:45,169
so this is another way to deal with

00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:47,090
these dilemmas and then we also perform

00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:50,380
the security audit and the results are

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:56,240
published on our website on this URL

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:58,580
because our community is partially

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,190
hackers and hackers are going to hack so

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,960
we got a lot of reports of people

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,140
opening The probe's like oh yeah let's

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,080
just see what it actually does and yeah

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:13,460
it actually does what we say but sure go

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,110
and check it out and so they they were

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,909
very nice to actually follow the

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,429
responsible disclosure procedure first

00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,440
tell us what they have discovered and

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,440
there were some bugs there's always bugs

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,760
so we fixed them and then we publish you

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,960
know the the report there yeah that's

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,640
what you get with the critical community

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,450
so we also have a lot of probes at

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,090
hacker spaces

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,980
if your hacker space doesn't have one I

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,049
will have some probes with me tomorrow

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,470
or you can also just request them and

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:48,320
then we will ship them to you so if you

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,720
want to take part in England's day we

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,740
already had four and there is another

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:58,309
one coming up in Amsterdam or if you are

00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:01,429
a student or a researcher you can get

00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:03,799
help to present your work at the

00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:07,700
conferences that we organized the so

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:10,340
called drive meetings you can apply if

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,179
you are researching some of these topics

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,460
or if you want to write a report about

00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:18,980
some project and so on and reach the

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,840
right community we have a platform for

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,850
right labs where you can publish that

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:29,960
research do we take questions only at

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:34,090
the end or now how are we doing with

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,090
that now we move on okay

00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:44,299
so this was the end of the official part

00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:47,179
and from now on the the rest is just my

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:56,649
opinions they're not opinions of my

00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:56,649
employer this is all on video hi boss

00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:07,779
so what I want to to explore here is how

00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:13,429
do we go beyond the technological

00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:16,729
optimism and and some of the advices

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,649
that I kind of summarize from all the

00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:22,960
literature that I read preparing for

00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:22,960
this talk is question everything

00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:31,759
embrace alternatives embrace diversity

00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:37,909
and build systems or take part in

00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:43,479
systems that support diversity inclusion

00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:50,330
and protection of the users and of life

00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:52,279
on earth so very inspirational paper

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:56,269
that I read was actually a transcript

00:29:52,279 --> 00:30:00,229
from a talk from a woman who who hacked

00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:03,679
the hackers ethic so she said well let's

00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:08,389
replace the hackers ethics with the set

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:11,570
of questions and they are really

00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:15,919
interesting questions like how do you

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:17,629
ensure that the computers that access to

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:24,349
the computer should be unlimited in

00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:27,440
total well to whom who gets to use your

00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:32,539
technology who doesn't get to use your

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,299
technology how is what you are making

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:39,139
making the access for some people more

00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:43,570
difficult or easier how is the

00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:45,970
information free which data are using

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,549
whose labor went into

00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,919
getting the data where it is and so on

00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:53,429
so all these questions are really really

00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,080
interesting and I encourage you to

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:59,500
contemplate on them when you're deciding

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,100
about which project to take part in and

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:09,299
what are the consequences of your

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:12,700
project and your software for example

00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:17,230
how open and inclusive is the hackers

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:20,769
movement and if our community is very

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,659
homogeneous as we can see actually even

00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:26,559
at looking at this room

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:28,870
then how is the technology that we are

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,809
making going to be inclusive and

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:35,620
actually help everybody so to that

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:37,570
extent this is a this is a small web

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,549
interface where you can change some

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,970
parameters to create a different picture

00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:47,289
which stays on the screen but as a

00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:50,040
larger message to all of you I say let's

00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:57,770
hack patriarchy

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:57,770
[Applause]

00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,510
here are some other questions to use for

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,040
conducting your network research on the

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,440
internet so there is a lot of

00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,770
information here I won't let you read

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,290
this I will let you read this one

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,740
because it's big letters and it's easy

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,740
to read

00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:30,190
so this is from a paper that was very

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,789
very inspirational for me from Philly

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:37,570
Broadway its moral considerations of

00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:40,119
cryptographic work and it's a very long

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,549
paper and then he comes up with with a

00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,710
lot of advices I have summarized them

00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:48,789
here for you and then there is like

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:50,979
three that I want to stress take into

00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,979
consideration the ordinary people and

00:32:50,979 --> 00:33:00,879
their needs when you are developing your

00:32:53,979 --> 00:33:05,789
technology get the systems view the

00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:11,049
large view they'll get a big picture and

00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:11,739
contribute to the Commons now again here

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:13,479
at FOSDEM

00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:17,349
I don't have to really tell you about

00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:19,269
the Commons you know all about it but I

00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:21,399
like this picture because it also has

00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:23,259
the yin and yang sign so there you go

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:28,869
and there's a lot of information in the

00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:32,080
notes now the other thing to consider is

00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:35,200
how would the internet look like if it

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,200
would be built on the feminist ethics on

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,090
the feminist principles and actually

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,129
some of the technologists and the

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,739
scientists and the engineers the the

00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:46,690
female technologies scientists and

00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:49,570
engineers got together a few years ago

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:52,659
and came up with this document which is

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,940
called the feminist internet and so

00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:57,399
again in the notes you can see the the

00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:01,539
references to this and the logo is quite

00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:03,249
beautiful too and then there are all

00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,679
kinds of other movements and other

00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:09,460
alternatives that you can consider which

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:13,029
have very similar principles and ethics

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:17,589
to the hackers ethics so there is

00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:21,970
anarchism there is permaculture there is

00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:25,210
the ecological movement Buddhism hippies

00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:29,020
so all of these subcultures and ethics

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:32,869
are influencing or could be influencing

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,069
our development of the technology

00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:39,469
and this is the quote from the paper

00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:42,460
that I just mentioned but then he quotes

00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:46,909
the Nobel Prize winner and and his

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:49,909
reception of the of his Nobel Prize he

00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:52,569
is a nuclear scientist and and he has

00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:56,450
been calling out to his fellow

00:34:52,569 --> 00:35:01,759
scientists to take the responsibility

00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:04,369
for the not destroying the world and not

00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:07,069
destroying all the other humans and I

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,960
say well since we are there let's also

00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:17,390
make sure that we don't destroy

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:20,479
squirrels because maybe our internet is

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:24,079
not the only internet maybe there is

00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:34,099
also an Internet of trees or the

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:36,289
Internet of mycelia and our way of

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,719
looking at things doesn't have to be

00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:42,289
like this doesn't have to be the

00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,960
hierarchical way but it can be the

00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:48,769
decentralized way the way how the nature

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,200
is the cyclic oh and so that we are not

00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:53,809
at the top of the hierarchy of life

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,190
between a part of life on this planet

00:35:53,809 --> 00:36:01,880
and so our technologies can be so

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:06,279
inclusive that are also not harming and

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:10,009
maybe even contributing to the life on

00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:12,829
this planet and so this is the message

00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:13,869
that I want to leave you with question

00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:19,160
everything

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:23,110
embrace alternatives and contribute to

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:41,550
the life on Earth thank you

00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:41,550
[Applause]

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,620
okay question everything starts with

00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,620
questioning me

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:07,869
[Applause]

00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,230
okay perfect

00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm a thank you for your talk I mean as

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:19,359
a community or Packers developers I a

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,790
I'm a scientist okay in computational

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,800
chemistry it it looks like an oxymoron

00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:31,440
but it exists I think at some point of

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:35,440
your talk you trap pass soffit similar

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,280
the difference between optimistic and

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,930
pessimistic views or of the world and I

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
can agree with you I mean it's not a

00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:47,020
matter of optimistic pessimistic views

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,050
and similar responsibilities the

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:54,400
community how we interact each other's

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:57,240
each other how we distribute our

00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,460
knowledge that's a very big problem too

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:04,869
vigor eyes I will say that it's it does

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:07,599
not mean to make our stuff stupid for

00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:12,059
people who are not in our field it means

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:19,859
how to communicate to them and my

00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:26,260
question is do you feel the hacker

00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:27,240
scientist developer communities though

00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,329
do they

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,910
question do they question so much the

00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:40,030
authority do they seek for power to

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:44,950
change this world and not made so ugly

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:48,609
something similar or do they go more and

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:51,910
more kind of individualistic I mean I I

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:55,839
looked up a very few groups that

00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:58,960
question authority a collective way and

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,280
not anyone with ease or air or star own

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:07,630
ethics okay that's that's a very good

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,089
question and I think that you already

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:14,920
answered it yourself so there are

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:16,010
hackers that do and but they do actually

00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,420
question authority

00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:25,730
and work into enabling other ways of

00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:30,970
distribution of power empowering those

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:33,859
that are weak but I'm afraid that

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,000
majority of hackers do not even think

00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:38,080
about that

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,390
majority of hackers are more like

00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,820
technological thinkers they like to play

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:49,070
with technology and do not like to think

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:53,570
about how is this technology used to for

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:56,960
political purposes and that my can be

00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,550
dangerous because then all the advances

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,740
that they make through their work

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,900
through their tinkering can be then

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:07,190
abused by those in power to get even

00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,470
more power and one of the positive one

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,869
of the examples that actually do have

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,960
that vision is a group that gave a

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:17,840
presentation few years ago at CCC

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,820
Congress which is a group called the

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:26,600
invisible committee and they have now a

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:29,180
book called to our friends which covers

00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,600
a lot of these questions and I would

00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:36,950
recommend that to you any other

00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:41,720
questions thank you very much for the

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:43,760
talk let's be practical and so I'm

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,670
maintaining an open source project what

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:51,619
can I do practically to make sure that

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:53,420
everything is epic ethical in this

00:40:51,619 --> 00:41:00,710
project are there some guidelines is

00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:04,520
there manifesto or whatever do you know

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:08,690
of a series of guidelines or a manifesto

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:12,070
something clear that can make me so I

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:16,790
can be sure that I do everything I can

00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:20,210
ethically for my projects yes so there

00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:23,390
are a lot of references in the notes of

00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,980
my slides and in the paper that we have

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,350
published about the ethic

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,510
in ripe Atlas measurements that is also

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:32,480
referenced from the force them talk

00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:36,350
there is not one paper you will have to

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,270
read let's say ten papers to see which

00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:42,710
one is relevant for your field of work

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:45,290
and if if it would be that easy to just

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:48,520
put it in one paper we wouldn't have

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:52,130
such a conference so there is a lot of

00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,070
thinking to be done and questioning so

00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,500
if you are concerned about something go

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,070
deeper and deeper and ask questions of

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,470
yourself of your colleagues of your

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,600
bigger field until you are happy that

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:12,170
you are actually doing the most ethical

00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:16,670
work possible so so you mentioned the

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:19,730
ipv6 earlier of course it's a sorry yeah

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:23,840
it's the new standard and everything so

00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:25,850
I dig a little bit in the standard

00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,940
itself recently for developing purpose

00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:31,130
and so on and I discovered well I knew

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,460
it partly but that it doesn't have

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,859
nothing masquerading so basically you

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,730
have a very huge number of IP addresses

00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:44,720
and you'll end up probably having each

00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:49,880
device having an ipv6 like maker for mac

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:53,359
addresses so how does the ripe or you

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,090
know the Jana Jana like justify that

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,790
like because that's actually the

00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:02,380
tracking device yes

00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:05,859
so there is an RFC that actually

00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:09,830
describes how can you implement the

00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:12,800
security extensions for the ipv6 so you

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:15,770
do not have to record the MAC address in

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,700
the ipv6 address you can have the

00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:22,790
pseudo-random number that hide your MAC

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:26,570
address so then your ipv6 address is

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:29,350
your identifier but not your MAC address

00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,350
is not visible

00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:37,720
indeed your comment is you're still

00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:39,790
trackable by the IP well that can be

00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,190
solved by using some other security

00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:46,300
privacy whatever measures which I'm not

00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,410
an expert in but from the ethical point

00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,690
of view and I already had this

00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,330
discussion over lunch with somebody we

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:55,840
can actually try to find all kinds of

00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:59,190
ways to go around the Big Brother or we

00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,190
can get rid of the Big Brother

00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:09,119
[Applause]

00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:33,259
hi first thanks for your target was very

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:36,259
interesting I have two questions for you

00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:40,430
and then I'd like to have a short

00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:43,460
position on that the first thing is auto

00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:49,089
updating the Atmos Pro if you enable all

00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:51,440
the updates you're in the opportunity to

00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:55,609
penetrate a private network just by

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,269
pushing a backdoor if you're not you are

00:44:55,609 --> 00:45:02,150
not able to fix a critical security

00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:04,969
vulnerability and the second thing I'd

00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:07,759
like to hear position is the freedom of

00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:10,460
use and open source software it usually

00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:13,069
includes military use and I don't like

00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:16,460
this and this is my biggest problem at

00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:20,799
open source software so can you explain

00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,799
your position on these two issues please

00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:31,009
so the first one that it was do we have

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:37,029
the automatic updates and how for the

00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:37,029
right what was firmware so they are

00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:46,579
pushed by us so that's the only way of

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,410
updating so the the probe tell the probe

00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:51,380
only connects to the centralized

00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:54,710
infrastructure by ripe NCC and when we

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:57,410
decide that there has to be an update

00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:59,930
then we let the probe update itself so

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:02,269
in the meantime if their vulnerabilities

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,099
then they avail I mean they are

00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:06,499
available there the probe is not not

00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:09,170
updated so in that dilemma that you

00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:13,849
presented we have we have chosen one

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:16,969
certain way and the other question is I

00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:17,569
think discussed very much as a topic at

00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:19,789
FOSDEM

00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:23,329
and I'm sure you can find people who are

00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:25,400
more knowledgeable than me but if you

00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:32,150
want my personal opinion then we can do

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:34,130
that over a beer okay if it's okay to

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,650
the presenter I have a short reply to

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,960
the second question

00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:41,830
sure but we have to hurry I know it's

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,190
Charlene it's basically it's your your

00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:49,240
ethics that decides that it's not okay

00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:52,060
so you're asking for contributing giving

00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,830
