	Ethics in Network Measurements  Moral obligations of engineers, scientists and hackers, based on example of RIPE Atlas

At: FOSDEM 2017

When designing technologies, networked systems, and measurements on theInternet, we must be aware of their implications and consequences for thesociety and participants. As engineers, scientists, programmers and otherexperts, we have moral obligations towards our peers, users of technologies wecreate, and the wider communities.

In this talk I want to talk both about general ethical considerations, andspecific examples of moral dilemmas that come from building the RIPE Atlassystem, and conducting measurements that reveal workings of Internetinfrastructure and services.

RIPE Atlas is an extensive measurement network, where the vantage points(sources of measurements) are hosted by volunteers: mostly individuals athome, but also some institutions (ISPs, IXPs, academia, various otherbusinesses). RIPE Atlas users are using someone else's Internet connection todo measurements. In order to recognise ethical considerations surrounding useof RIPE Atlas, we looked both into the historical considerations of engineersand scientists, and into practical constraints users should keep in mind, andwe published some findings in this article:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/kistel/ethics-of-ripe-atlas-measurements
