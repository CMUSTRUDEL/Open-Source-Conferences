At: FOSDEM 2017

The goal of this talk is to give a simple insight of what quantum computingis, what makes it so different; to see when it poses a threat to existingcrypto solutions and when it is not.

This talk will show what quantum computing is: how cubit is different from anordinary bit and what new opportunities this provides. We'll take a look atalgorithms important for cryptanalysis. QCL — a free software tool to simulatequantum computer will be discussed as well.

In the second part of this talk an impact on widely used cryptographicalgorithms will be discussed. Algorithms resilient to quantum computing willbe reviewed. Codecrypt — a free GPG-like software for postquantum crypto willbe discussed.

Note: this talk is intended to be an understandable overview, not a completelystrict and full introduction to the subject.

_Erratum:_ As was noted after my talk by one of the listeners from the OxfordUniversity, slide 9 "Qubits: implementation" contains outdated informationabout quantum storage progress: the latest result allows to store it forseveral hours instead of 1.75 sec I mentioned. Impressive progress. Thank youfor your input, friend, sorry I don't know your name.
