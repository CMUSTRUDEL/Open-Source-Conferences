To offer supercomputing services to all Cuban institutes of higher education,research centers and industrial partners is the mission set forth by a groupof ambitious young system administrators working at various universities ofthe lush Caribbean island of Cuba. With the assistance of the Flemish Inter-university Council (VLIR), lots of hard work and hardware donations by GhentUniversity they have succeeded in setting up a nation-spanning architecturecomprised of three datacenters, in Havana (West), Santa Clara (central) andSantiago de Cuba (East). Their campuses are spread geographically across the1000 km long island and are interconnected by a 20 Mbps network that covers upto the furthest regions of the island where remote rural universities aregiven the opportunity to take advantage of the magnificent capacities ofmassive parallel processing.

Thus was born "HPC Cuba" the national center for academic supercomputing.While fully depending on Free Software for their operations, HPC Cuba has alsojoined the global Free Software community by producing installation packagesfor software not yet covered by EasyBuild.

On a tropical island where access to resources is being limited by a USimposed trade embargo, setting up a datacenter capable of hosting a propersupercomputer "no es fÃ¡cil" ("it is not easy", a Cuban saying). Come learnabout the specific challenges poised in the Cuban context, calling forresourceful solutions and unique problem-solving capacities standing proof ofthe high standard of the universities of this so-called third world countryand its relentless human resources.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,599
next up is

00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:14,969
so Hector and bitter we're gonna talk

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:19,500
about the birth of HPC in Cuba hmm good

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,100
morning my name is Aaron I happy to be

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,640
here to tell you what we are doing for

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:31,430
for making a PC service available for q1

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,600
scientists the laws you can see

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,680
institutions that are supporting our

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,760
Pruitt's the build us that is the

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,129
Flemish University Council also with red

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,710
dots you is a collaboration project with

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,020
Flemish University and six human

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,950
universities were three of the harbour

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,950
involve display the week called HPC Cuba

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,750
we want to make a p-series service

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:07,470
available for all Q and scientists so

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,820
our mission is to provide centralized

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:15,780
access to HPC infrastructure also to

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,090
offer training to our HPC staff and also

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,060
to support our users belonging to the

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:28,710
higher education system also to earth

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:32,329
research institution in Coover the HPC

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,390
Cuba Prewitt that we can also call to

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:40,680
Center for academic supercomputing it

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,950
was thought with Yaffe distribution of

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,060
the HPC infrastructure in three main

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,700
points in Habana Santa Clara and

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,939
Santiago de Cuba in three universities

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,009
the University of infirmary science in

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,840
Havana the Central University of Las

00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,939
Pinas in Santa Clara University of

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,180
Oriental in Santiago de Cuba

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,049
so facts about Cuba so Cuba is the

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,329
biggest island the Caribbean also with

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,390
the tropical climates it's a dual

00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:15,510
destination also they our high

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,940
educational standard is true so we are

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,410
friendly people so

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:26,430
is also a safest place in America but we

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:31,560
are still living upon the USA embargo so

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:34,680
it calls also on limitation lie the

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,780
language also received access to the

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,950
information in internet because some

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,830
sites are broken our Qi piece so also

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:48,720
the artists to the infrastructure become

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:51,150
problematic sometimes it's the Americans

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,920
locking their sites for Cuban access

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,020
it's not the Cuban government blocking

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,280
the access for the Cuban population it's

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,480
the other way around many people think

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,840
if thank you for the clarification that

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:09,720
this is Cuba we are very close to us say

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Florida so you can files them up okay

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:18,630
this boy idea starting in 2015 when we

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,600
saw two more HPC clusters one in Santa

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,700
Clara is Herbie and the other one in

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,300
Oriental University in the eastern part

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,250
of the country but our goal is to

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:32,430
provide the access to the whole country

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,300
now it's turning a new one in Havana in

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,940
the university of informal science maybe

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,400
you have heard about the leanest nova

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:49,280
distribution de was was the world there

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,840
but also in Cuba you can take a walk

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,900
riding nice old cars

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,440
I enjoy this mark on during the evening

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,300
so in Santa Clara you can find the

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,670
central university of latvia with very

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,560
nice university campus in aberdeen

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,080
natural environment with a lot of

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,290
streets also you can find beautiful

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,109
beaches in the north code of the

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,720
province so in kayo Santa Maria or we

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:25,050
have heard many workshops regarding ICT

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,900
in Oriente is also a nice place with a

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,590
very friendly people were been young

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,600
virgins become Q ones

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,300
immediately so it's difficult to

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,420
recognize to deter but maybe because he

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:48,030
is taller than Cubans so highlighted in

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:51,990
red the HBC closer in University of

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:56,730
Oriental also in University of Las

00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:00,030
Villas what we are doing right now so

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:04,140
our plan now immediately for 2017 is to

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:09,060
insert to IBM a clustered with the

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:12,210
capacity of about seat 600 course I want

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,620
Arab Iran in Havana and Santa Clara also

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:24,960
in Santa Clara a bit data cluster with

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:28,050
20 servers and two NVIDIA GPU cards in

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,030
Oriental University a Dell server with

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,390
similar they're closer sorry with

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:37,940
similar capacity ball using infinite

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:44,750
Valentin orgy for the interconnectivity

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,750
so that is what we are talking about so

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:54,480
what was this in Oriente was already

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:55,680
start were either Jo order specialists

00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,270
are working hard

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:05,760
mmm-hmm to make this possible so there

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,330
is our goal for for this year market the

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,130
hardware is donated by Ghent University

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,520
it's impossible for Kim universities to

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,460
buy IBM or Dell or HP hardware it's

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,560
illegal for Dell to export to Cuba if

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,130
Adele salesperson cells to accumulate

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,900
her university you lose this job okay

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,340
but okay with collaboration with the

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,700
Flemish universities we've been able to

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,700
establish some infrastructure in human

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:41,939
so everything we are using is free

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:46,590
software so so far we have Debian as

00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:52,680
operating system using Turkey PBS and

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:54,029
Maui for managing Kiwis and jobs also

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,560
using a gunked-up for monitoring

00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:00,509
purposes but we are exploring a new

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:06,960
alternative for the new implementation

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:10,830
may be using scent of flu maybe or

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:17,400
anything so that is what we are thinking

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:22,310
about we are exploring to do that we

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:28,740
have offered web portals to support

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:31,650
users so this is another example in

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,599
University of orienting also a wiki and

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:39,560
sorry for the language scores for

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:43,860
queuing users also building different

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,889
ways to access to the cluster of for

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:52,949
monitoring purposes for example you can

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:57,449
access using SSH for Luke the Cubist

00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:00,360
state you can do that also using the web

00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:04,439
interface the same for the job states

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:10,620
it's more comfortable for no IT user to

00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:13,409
use the web access and also we are

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,879
creating zone templates for a script

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:23,430
tool so many jobs in the word web via

00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:26,909
web also is possible so now we can see

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:31,379
how many institutions in Cuba are using

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:36,479
our HTC facilities also you can find so

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:39,300
a user from be weak so I have no idea

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,779
what he's doing our poster but ok it's

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,879
here also people from

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,490
Brazilian from Brazilian University

00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:52,300
because you are helping off we are

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,759
helping resilient guys so so we are

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,399
happy with that with the uses we are

00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,399
that it's a lot of EQ my University in

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:12,279
University so we have infrastructure in

00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,769
the three main the biggest three main

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,269
universities of the island and as you

00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,949
can see the infrastructure is working

00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,259
well already on a high level using

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:23,170
nothing but free and open source

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,930
solutions and all kinds of institutions

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:33,129
and research institutes are using

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:36,759
already our infrastructure ok so some

00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:40,180
examples at different resorts accusing

00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:43,350
our HPC for a sample for a video

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:48,339
encoding in the Q one detail television

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,949
broadcasting for example also for sign

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:54,579
are processing uses neural net neural

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:56,889
networks for health applications also

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:59,800
from the environment also for the

00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:02,259
chemistry application where they

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,170
couldn't do the job with the very good

00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,059
lat talk with CCG around it was not

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,430
possible but in our closing oriented

00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:15,519
University in 50 minutes it would solve

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:20,050
so all scientific papers so it used to

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:24,689
have an idea that our scientists in Cuba

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,759
are using our what we are doing so now

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:31,120
we have a national strategy that

00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,509
includes capacity building so it would

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,679
be important for us to train our HTC

00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:43,470
staff developing training or work shows

00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:47,889
it could be in Cuba or in Verger also

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,459
supporting the users and establishment

00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:56,470
of synergies with our institution so is

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:57,670
this our national study this is it was

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,990
our our first

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:09,870
worship in Santa Clara the participation

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:15,190
of HPC as perform gain University was

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:16,240
sponsored by Blair so we can see Alvaro

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:23,200
you can see here

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:28,750
so our is here so Albert would be very

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,570
good reference of Cuba our job also rudy

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:36,880
is here and dieter okay of course but

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:39,670
also some people from Ecuador Peru were

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:47,140
trying because it had regional inputs

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:50,709
also of course for our national strategy

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:56,820
we had to face some drawbacks for

00:11:50,709 --> 00:12:00,970
example the language also also they

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:05,380
access policy because sometimes the SSH

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:08,380
port our rocket when you go from another

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,740
institution to another so we have to to

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,579
face that also broadcast we have and

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,370
score the US a trade embargo is still

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,250
present and nobody knows what would Ron

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,269
do in the future regarding Cuba so we

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,209
are to see but now we are we are focus

00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:33,630
and to develop centralized

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:38,140
authentication system with a national

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:41,980
from and also to improve our grades our

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:45,940
storage capacity train our people make

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:50,050
easier the users installation by using

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:55,260
so facility that we will show now this

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:59,769
is our user management approach with

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,079
national front end with centralized

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,790
authentication with redundancy also the

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,660
login nodes are connected to the head of

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,870
the cluster and also access to scratch

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,940
using InfiniBand

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,000
to the home of the user over the data

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,320
user Novi City so it is a that so

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,330
actually the the infrastructure is

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,710
working at the separate universities and

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,050
what you're working on now is like a

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,820
layer on top of that national user

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,790
accounts so if you have a user account

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,920
for HPC Cuba at your home university you

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,670
can access infrastructure at another

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,900
University also for making easier the

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:42,150
installation for users we are trying to

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:44,910
use easy would were we say that we

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,910
already have a Cuban contribution to the

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,610
easy build a community developing the

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,730
Jade for example I know that Canada can

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,890
have been our guide and also supervisor

00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,450
our developers so we are also working in

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:04,560
helping sunset with the Clipper open

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:10,380
phones so maybe Kenny can spray much

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:13,529
more okay so it's a sample of the 88

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:23,430
installation the world for our staff

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:25,920
Akua so guys we need HPC as per like

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,029
youth to join us and this tree to make

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,880
it possible

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:32,270
okay so thank you very much for your

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,270
attention

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:41,669
[Applause]

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,600
well you see actually we're just we're

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,700
using the hardware that we can get our

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,190
hands on yes we don't really have to

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,050
Liberty to choose the hard way I'm just

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,850
happy to be sleepy these were good

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,660
clusters working very well at Ghent

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,160
University

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,100
they were decommissioned for all kinds

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,120
of reasons and instead of showing them

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,680
into the furnace we decided to export

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,410
them to Cuba and donate them to Cuban

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,930
University if you have another cluster

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:09,690
available for us please help us so just

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,180
wondering where can we find more

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,390
information about the ongoing projects

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:21,300
and that you're asking for HPC experts

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:24,000
to get involved please send us an email

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,770
so we have your email and then we can

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,390
see back yes in the future we are always

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,270
organizing trainings Cubans are coming

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,640
to Belgium seek accuracy right now

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,470
we are sending experts to Cuba every

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,540
time we have funds we get funding from

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,070
the Flemish Interuniversity Council and

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,860
the deal is basically that it's

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,330
volunteer work but you get your ticket

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,490
page your hotel there is paid to get a

00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,339
per diem and what we see is people go

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,050
there and then they

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,509
for an extra week extra two weeks to go

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:57,790
on holiday that's just fine yeah we are

00:16:52,509 --> 00:17:00,370
right now applying for for record so we

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,769
can promise anything but maybe for the

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,650
next year we can have some budgets

00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:11,559
supporting our projects so we will need

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:14,380
some Europe passports to support also

00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:17,770
teaching our stuff so our tuk can come

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,189
here and our trainers can go to Cuba

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,189
also

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:36,119
so the question is about the electricity

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:39,509
and do we use ups or do we generate our

00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,779
own electricity well the experience is

00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:44,999
that the electricity in Cuba is unstable

00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:49,169
it's very normal to have small outages

00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:51,090
we use UPS mostly to stabilize the the

00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:54,360
mains current and we have generators

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:58,950
also yeah but outages are quite common

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:03,179
so where we use UPS also some inverters

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:06,679
with batteries it's nice at the UPS of

00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,679
course also generators

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,499
[Music]

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,940
so the question is maybe we should focus

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:58,700
on open hardware or open the open BC

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:01,790
infrastructure instead of looking for us

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,850
Archer providers yeah we can look into

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,820
it but for right now I think financially

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,530
it would be very difficult for us to

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,140
start building or to start looking in

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:15,380
that direction from up until now we've

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,980
depended on three hardware free is

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,130
always cheaper than then maybe open can

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,130
be

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,120
okay it could be used for anybody so we

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,750
are focused mainly now in this first

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:46,940
step in scientific community because are

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:49,460
the people that have more needs well HPC

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,760
but for one of the example that I'd

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:58,250
shoulder regarding to the video encoding

00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:01,820
for the national q1 DITA television

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:06,710
broadcasting is know for scientific

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:09,610
purposes it was for storage the the

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:13,340
materials in the format that their needs

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,820
also for the broadcasting to the Cuban

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,820
people

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:32,759
No

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:32,759
