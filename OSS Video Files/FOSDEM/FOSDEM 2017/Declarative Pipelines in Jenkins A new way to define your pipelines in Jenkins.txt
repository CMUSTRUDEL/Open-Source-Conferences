Pipeline is quickly establishing itself as the direction that Jenkins jobs aregoing, enabling the definition of a complete CD pipeline in a single job;Pipeline as Code via the “Jenkinsfile”; job durability across master restarts;and more. I’ll be talking here about the next evolution for Pipeline that isjust now hitting 1.0: a simple, declarative model to define your Pipelineswith no need to write scripts. This configuration syntax for Pipeline allowsyou to automatically configure all stages of your pipeline, the complete buildenvironment, post-build actions, notifications and more. All while providingsyntactic and semantic validation before the build actually gets going. We'llalso play with the just-released initial version of the Pipeline Editor, builtto work with Declarative!
