Implementing use cases on unified data platforms. Having a unified dataprocessing engine empowers Big Data application developers as it makesconnections between seemingly unrelated use cases natural. This talk discussesthe implementation of the so-called BigPetStore project (which is a part ofApache Bigtop) in Apache Spark and Apache Flink. The aim BigPetStore is toprovide a common suite to test and benchmark Big Data installations. The talkfeatures best practices and implementation with the batch, streaming, SQL,DataFrames and machine learning APIs of Apache Spark and Apache Flink side byside. A range of use cases are outlined in both systems from data generation,through ETL, recommender systems to online prediction.
