Apache NiFi provided a revolutionary data flow management system with a broadrange of integrations with existing data production, consumption, and analysisecosystems, all covered with robust data delivery and provenanceinfrastructure. Now learn about the follow-on project which expands the reachof NiFi to the edge, Apache MiNiFi. MiNiFi is a lightweight application whichcan be deployed on hardware orders of magnitude smaller and less powerful thanthe existing standard data collection platforms. With both a JVM compatibleand native agent, MiNiFi allows data collection in brand new environments â€”sensors with tiny footprints, distributed systems with intermittent orrestricted bandwidth, and even disposable or ephemeral hardware. Not only canthis data be prioritized and have some initial analysis performed at the edge,it can be encrypted and secured immediately. Local governance and regulatorypolicies can be applied across geopolitical boundaries to conform with legalrequirements. And all of this configuration can be done from central command &control using an existing NiFi with the trusted and stable UI data flowmanagers already love.
