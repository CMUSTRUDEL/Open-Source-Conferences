Hadoop has been touted as a replacement for data warehouses. In practiceHadoop has had success offloading ETL/ELT workloads, but still has gapsserving requirements for operational analytics.

Apache Bigtop now includes Greenplum Database in deployment of big datasolutions. Greenplum Database is, an open source massively parallel datawarehouse based on PostgreSQL, and is an excellent addition to the Hadoopecosystem.

In this session we'll cover: * Introduction to Greenplum * Bigtop Support forGreenplum * External tables in Hadoop by Greenplum * Parallel reads and writesto Hadoop by Greenplum * Running advanced analytics on structured andunstructured data in both Hadoop and Greenplum via Apache MADlib (incubating)* Geospatial and Machine Learning in Greenplum based on HDFS data * Storingdata from a data lake in Greenplum for high throughput analytical queries
