Title: All Ages: How to Build a Movement
Publication date: 2018-03-06
Playlist: FOSDEM 2017
Description: 
	by Deb Nicholson and Molly de Blanc

At: FOSDEM 2017

We want the free software movement to keep growing and one facet of successfulmovement building is embracing a multi-generational community. The good newsis that there is no age requirement for using, promoting and contributing tofree software. The bad news is that we aren't always doing a great job offacilitating a diverse, inter-generational movement. We'll take a look at whatwe're currently doing to bring in young people, how we are treating olderpeople in our communities and where there is room for improvement.

Using examples from other movements and inter-generational communities, we'llidentify tactics that aren't being used to build the free software communityand see what we can collectively port over. We plan to inspire the audience tofind ways to recruit and retain young people, inspire older people toparticipate and maintain an unbroken thread of free software conservatorship.

okay your neck

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:18,410
speakers are dead aunt Molly talking

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:19,160
about how to build a movement things are

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,940
coming

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:27,230
this is Molly de Blanc this is Deb

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:29,090
Nicholson that's okay go in it could be

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,010
someone else's problem we're going to

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,160
talk about how to build an all-ages free

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,739
software movement if you want to tweet

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,570
about that topic you can use this

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,940
hashtag or you can use it on other

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,860
social media whatever you like

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:52,399
I'm bacon and coconut and this is Molly

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:55,030
millions and millions and great we

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,649
believe that in order to build a strong

00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,629
successful ongoing movement that can

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:00,379
really create change especially on a

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,750
global scale

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,759
you need to have diverse and inclusive

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,770
communities where you have a wide

00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:09,650
variety of experiences and specialized

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,270
knowledge age is one of the particular

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,380
issues in which we aren't necessarily

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,790
great at so what we're gonna cover is

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,890
we're gonna go a little bit deeper on

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,020
why we care and then we're gonna look

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,180
specifically at what's going on with age

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,130
in our communities and then we're gonna

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,500
talk about some solutions we like some

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,570
that already exist and some that perhaps

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,680
we'll be able to inspire folks here to

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:38,119
help us create so going on to why we

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,460
care movements that are successful or

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,409
persistent and they last for a long time

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,990
and that means that you have to be able

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:48,170
to pass the torch from one generation to

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,659
the next without losing kind of what

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,360
really makes the movement special and

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,240
motivating and you know it can't just

00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,549
kind of degrade into this thing we show

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,960
up for and so that means not just

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:07,850
communicating how we do it but why we do

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,009
it so we're focused on talking about

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,450
movements right now free software tools

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,159
are great I use a whole bunch of them

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,779
Deb uses a whole bunch of them I hope

00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,840
all of you also use a whole bunch of

00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:21,280
them but right now we want to talk

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,580
about how to push a movement forward

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,470
right so free software is a philosophy

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,720
and there's a wonderful developmental

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,670
model that is enabled by this philosophy

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,709
when you're building a movement you're

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,810
really looking at a long term plan and

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,330
so sometimes you'll do things that don't

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,970
have short-term payoffs and that's what

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,299
we're really talking about now and in

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,400
fact the tools and the movement feed off

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,420
of each other like yeast and maybe they

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,940
create exciting things like beer but the

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,430
the things like shared decision-making

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,180
and transparency and consensus building

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,370
are often what that sort of mutual

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,590
feeding can look like and they tend to

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,680
produce exciting successful fast

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:10,340
projects when they're done Wow and then

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,349
that's it communities have to focus on

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,000
people so these folks I assume they're

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,829
having a lot of fun even though they

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,180
look half dead right

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:21,650
and so communities need to sort of focus

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,690
on individuals and making sure that

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,370
everyone's having a good time or people

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,500
will stop showing up no matter what

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,500
their age is so this is going to be very

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,600
much for communities some of it may be

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,980
helpful to you and your company but

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,609
we're really talking about the

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,380
communities which are people we also are

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,400
aware and think everyone needs to be

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,859
aware of the difference between

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,690
diversity and inclusivity these days

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,510
people are putting them together a lot

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,819
more diversity one way to think about it

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,829
is the picture on your textbook or in

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,079
the advertisement where it's like oh

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,720
there's the blonde girl and there's the

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,609
black kid and there's the Asian guy and

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,019
instead of space where people feel

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:02,260
welcome and feel like they're can

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,810
contribute and be part of a community

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,630
right so more than just optics this is a

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:12,829
whole study on how diversity makes

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:16,070
groups smarter and what this researcher

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,380
found was that when people are preparing

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,400
an argument that they perceive for

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,349
someone they perceived to be as

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,780
different from them they actually

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,880
prepare a better more thorough argument

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,610
they're like I did more of my homework I

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,449
did more of the work too

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:35,229
my point and this happens in politics it

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:37,479
happens a long different lines like when

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,069
someone is presenting something to a

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,830
different gender or a different race or

00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,840
a different political party they tend to

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,509
present stronger more well-thought-out

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,699
ideas which I think makes our movements

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:53,740
stronger and this one is also about

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,689
diversity but this is about not just

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,150
sort of like you were talking about the

00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,580
picture or like sort of the sprinkling

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,659
of diversity or the diversity on your

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,030
pamphlet only but diverse headcount is

00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:10,389
useless without inclusivity so people

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,819
need to want to stick around if you've

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,639
got one person who's like your token

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:19,120
woman they're not going to be very happy

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,870
being your token for very long so our

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,800
challenge is to not just go to the

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,689
letter of like your organization's

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,080
diversity statement but to really kind

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:34,000
of arms wide open and not not this is a

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,759
metaphor don't physically touch people

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,990
when they get to your community but

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,419
until you know them until you know them

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,129
but it means asking them questions and

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,659
then listening to the answers about how

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,759
they're doing in your community

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,529
it means incorporating their ideas

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,879
making sure they're at the meetings

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,789
where important decisions are made

00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,409
making sure they have access to the

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,180
information about like what is

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,029
successful and what's not successful

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,669
about your project another way to think

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,770
about this is as shared power so if

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,469
there's an invisible barrier between

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,169
like entry level you get to be in our

00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:10,360
yearly photo and oh the board which

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,419
drives all of our actual decisions over

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,389
here you're not going to have people

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,879
keep coming to your project to just be

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:22,000
part of your yearly photo so you really

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,520
need to share power if you want people

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,629
from groups that you haven't had in your

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:34,120
project before to stick around so who is

00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:37,539
a minority in tech you're all of these

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,200
people this photo was from women of

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,490
color and texture they did

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,110
session where they took a bunch of stock

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,120
photos that wonderful people like you

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,120
can now use when you need stock photos

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,350
[Applause]

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,240
though this is another person who's of

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,240
mine already a tech I love this photo

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,820
cuz it's like classic hacker computer

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,930
screen darkroom she's up to no good look

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,940
at that face oh yeah she's definitely

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,720
ddossing something I'm sure she might be

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,780
right

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,420
so to be more specific about some groups

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,930
that are minorities in tech now we did

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,820
our best to try to use terminology here

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,390
that seemed like the right terminology

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,460
to us if you know better words we should

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,610
be using please talk to us afterwards or

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,560
you could tweet at us so that we can do

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,090
better in the future

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,520
so there's there are minorities of

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,880
gender and that usually just kind of

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,620
means anyone who is in a man race and

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,380
ethnicity you're dealing with people of

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,370
color first introduced or native people

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,830
people who identify as latina or Latino

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,270
and background is also there as well so

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,490
there are people with disabilities

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,260
people who are blind if you have a

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,210
particular problem with your project so

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,100
it doesn't meet typical accessibility

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,660
standards some might not some one might

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,350
not be able to contribute but they also

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,900
might just not be able to use it non

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,150
college graduates kind of a side note on

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,460
that is it's it's still easier to get

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,390
involved in tech if you're a man

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,310
regardless of whether or not you have a

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,130
degree and it's a lot harder for women

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,200
and other minorities to get involved

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,940
when they don't have degrees people

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,340
outside of technical education and

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,900
skills like you didn't study computer

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,370
science you didn't study mathematics you

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,100
don't have a background in that but then

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,330
you decide it's a thing you want to do

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,010
working-class people so people who

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,860
aren't from middle class backgrounds or

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,470
aren't currently middle class and people

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,120
over the age of 35 and soon we will talk

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,660
about my 35 is a significant number

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,570
great

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,840
so for intersectionality the same kinds

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:52,050
of institutional mindsets policies and

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,500
social norms affect people across

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,510
different demographic groups so the same

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,150
kinds of things that could lead people

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,370
to make women uncomfortable are similar

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,540
and related to or the same as the kind

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,200
of things that could make someone who's

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,960
older uncomfortable like a grumpy

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,260
mailing list great so oppressive

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,970
institutions are interconnected but we

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,730
haven't really addressed age yet which

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,580
is why we're gonna talk about that well

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,440
there's more and now we have people of

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,030
all ages working in free and open source

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,600
software so it's a great time to start

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:30,990
talking about this so what's going on

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,050
with age this is a really interesting

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,020
problem because it's highly enforced by

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,740
popular culture and it's reflected in a

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:44,730
lot of companies ideas about culture fit

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,830
and we'll go into that this is a quote

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,290
from Mark Zuckerberg yeah Mark

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,660
Zuckerberg so we're from Massachusetts

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,660
in the state of Massachusetts what

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:02,220
Massachusetts no no okay

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,480
we live in the state of Massachusetts

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,180
the Department of Labor and

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,250
Massachusetts defines anyone in the

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,610
workforce over the age of 40 as an

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,440
advanced worker keep that in mind if

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:20,550
you're over 40 you're totally great

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:22,530
regardless that's what they told me so

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,450
Mark Zuckerberg is this guy he made a

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,470
website or something I hear some people

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,930
use it he said I want to stress the

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,050
importance of being young and technical

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,600
young people are just smarter why are

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,870
most chess masters under 30 he said this

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,740
when he was like 22 or 23 so you're

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,470
seeing this view of younger people and

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,400
older people in technology from someone

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:54,720
who's younger as well and then this is

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,250
from Vinod Khosla a people under 35 are

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,530
the people who make change happen and

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,060
older entrepreneurs fail to innovate

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,590
because they're falling back on old

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:08,130
habits he was 56 when he said this so

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,470
Tech has an age problem we're on this

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,750
the H problem doesn't is not limited to

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:19,140
individuals talking to one another it

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:22,360
really is an institutional issue in 2011

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,030
Brian Reid he was a Google employee he

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,890
was let go of her fired from his job he

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,410
sued Google as an age discrimination

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,350
suit there'd been a lot of conversations

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,540
on his team about his age and how he was

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,470
boring and he was old and his ideas

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,270
weren't any good and this created a

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,280
space where he didn't feel like he could

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,360
participate in the team but it was also

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,110
very clear that people weren't

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,250
respecting him for his experience 20

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,470
2013 Facebook also had a similar thing

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,600
but it was related to a job listing a

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,300
number of job listings really like to

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,060
focus entry-level job listings like to

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,180
focus on the concept of new grads rather

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:08,230
than people who are just starting in the

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,150
field here are some specific details I

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,490
found out about age median age of

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,870
employees Facebook comes in pretty young

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:21,190
for large tech companies at 26 and HP

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,990
comes in at 39 which is the oldest now

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,250
none of these people are advanced

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,160
workers according to the state of

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,810
Massachusetts I'm going to check my

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,730
notes to make sure I get the next set of

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,550
Statistics right because there are some

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,630
more remember

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:39,130
incidentally and this is this is from

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:41,110
like job rating websites HP lists or

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,300
it's consider that the average number of

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,390
hours of HP employee works during a

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,370
single day is 7.5 this is in comparison

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:55,750
to Facebook where people are citing

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:57,640
their averages between 9 and 10 so the

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,290
way we treat older people are older and

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,810
younger people in our communities often

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,580
based on assumptions and of course those

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,530
assumptions are pretty different for the

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,820
two groups and we're gonna look at young

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,860
people first young people is a pretty

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,990
wide breadth here we're using that to

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,730
refer to people who are not yet in

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,780
college or who are in college

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:23,500
and you know or for lack of a better

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,880
term are not yet of a working age and so

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,300
these are people that we want to have

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,490
drink the free-software kool-aid right

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,710
and we want to we're going to talk about

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,180
both pre college and then also college

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,220
student age so as Molly pointed out

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,800
Facebook has people working at nine or

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,050
ten hours a day which of course like

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,910
then it kind of like reveals what they

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,430
might like about younger workers as

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,220
opposed to older workers not necessarily

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,530
their sparkly ideas but their interest

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,380
or willingness to work for 10 hours a

00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:01,900
day and so those say things like class

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:03,730
of 2015 or 2016 preferred and they get

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,410
they try and convince folks like you can

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,180
treat the office like your home it can

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,390
be like your living room will do your

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,430
laundry for you you know encouraging

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,790
people to eat at the office like there

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,040
are companies that if you if you come in

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,110
for breakfast and stay till dinner and

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,770
then two more hours you get a free ride

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,630
home in an uber and so you know they

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,100
really have this go to a science where

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,950
they get you to come in and do 10 hours

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,570
a day for as long as possible another

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,950
thing that I think may be happening is

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,530
that younger people don't have the

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,410
experience to negotiate work terms and

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,450
that includes things like who owns their

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,100
software what kinds of licenses they're

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,830
willing to have their code put under and

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:50,020
of course like workplace conditions and

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:52,000
hours and things like that how many of

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,320
you got involved with free or

00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,550
open-source software before you are 24

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:03,100
Wow I hollered ain't cool okay now I

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,470
want it so who here is currently in some

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,060
capacity contributing to a project this

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,830
can mean you're using it but it could

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,450
also mean you're walking around telling

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,090
people how great it is you're trying to

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,220
get everybody using Libre Office you're

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:19,420
writing code you're going to conferences

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,800
you're running conferences awesome so

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,940
keep your hands up I like having the

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,769
hands up thing it's like you're

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,470
participating

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,720
great now how many of you are involved

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,629
in those specific projects before you

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,059
are 24 okay how many of you while you're

00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:37,959
still in college okay how many of you

00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:41,049
are actually Wesley Crusher next slide

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,179
yeah there's Wesley Crusher cool in a

00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:46,089
lot of projects similar to how you might

00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:48,790
see tok like other tokenism there's also

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,670
frequently like the token kid who's this

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,040
guy who's like super smart and super

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,720
bright and super sharp and he's involved

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,119
and he's everywhere and everybody's

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,569
really excited to help him and be

00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:02,709
involved with him but that's only one

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,179
person and that doesn't mean you're

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,649
actually creating a space for other

00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,239
people especially if there are other

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,860
people who aren't already coming at

00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:10,420
something as someone who feels empowered

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,899
to participate and to make space for

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,040
themselves the Gryffindor Quidditch team

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,889
is a really good example of this

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,509
actually because you have Harry Potter I

00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:23,290
love Harry Potter but she picked this

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:24,639
slide by the way this was not me so in

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,220
the Gryffindor Quidditch team you have

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,379
Harry Potter who's just like the best at

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,360
this random wizard sport and he doesn't

00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:33,309
need any training he just like shows up

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,709
and he's brilliant from day one the

00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,990
thing is generally younger people need

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,040
more training and then when you're

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,929
looking at people who are already

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,009
graduates people who've been involved in

00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:44,290
things for a while people who have

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,639
different kinds of backgrounds so you

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,980
need to be there and you need to be

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,939
ready to work with people to get them up

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,519
to speed next slide one of the ways you

00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:56,259
do this is mentorship having a mentor is

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,360
really great you know you need things

00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:59,649
you need handles you need identities you

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,249
need people to tell you when you're

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,049
being universally stupid okay some of

00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,889
you are hackers hackers fans at least I

00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,709
hear a few laughs

00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:09,610
um so that's where mentors come in and

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,470
there are people who are already

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,120
experienced and these can be peer

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,279
mentors so they can be people your age

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,959
peer mentorship is really great it's

00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,120
super useful it's one of the best ways

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,579
to get people to get people

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,770
understanding things and interested in

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,329
them especially younger people but it's

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,740
also just wonderful to have somebody

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,340
who's looking out for you and helping

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,919
you develop a kind of one particular

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,590
example of this is the tools a lot of

00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,909
free software projects use

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:41,400
our older tools I think I RSSI and in

00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,770
general I RAC L yeah another is a high

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,429
our SSI user over there similar Qaddafi

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,029
to high five yeah I a lot of like people

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:52,440
are now switching to slack or HipChat

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,299
but IRC is still there and you know

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,120
people keep telling me it's hard to use

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,799
I'm not convinced it is you know it took

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,779
me a few tries to figure it out but I'm

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,799
pretty sure I can generally do it now as

00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,010
long as they don't actually close the

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,789
screen so now we're going to talk about

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,620
older people culture impacts what we

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:13,380
think and what kinds of assumptions we

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,270
make so I spend a lot of time last year

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,610
looking at when when and if actually I

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,010
could find depictions of older women in

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,750
tech and I was gonna start looking for

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,700
women over 50 and then when I started

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,919
looking I realized like oh I have to go

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,409
lower I if I want to look at like

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,350
fictional technical women I assess see

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:37,169
if I can find any over 40 and I was only

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,539
able to find for like could all of the

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,669
TIA like I asked people all over the

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,620
internet if they could think of anyone -

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,149
were ones that aged up with their

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,830
franchise so we had send me at the

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:49,110
Carter from Stargate and lieutenant

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:53,010
Uhura from Star Trek and then the other

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:56,190
two were newer shows but women in a

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,070
technical / management role not like you

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,380
know coding at night and guzzling you

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,110
know redbull or whatever but managing

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,730
people there's there's also failed to

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,590
mention this there's the nurse in Star

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,330
Trek TOS I don't remember her name which

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,039
shows you how important she was but

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,730
later in the movie she becomes a doctor

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,200
I just heard a lot of people you like

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,320
someone to tweet that at us and we'll

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,120
add it for next time so the two that I

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,520
found in the technical management role

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,549
is Nina sharp from the fringe so if

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,740
people watched that and then and I

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:30,630
watched this you don't have to Avery

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,049
Ryan which is Patricia Arquette's

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:37,049
character and CSI cyber so those are the

00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,640
only two other examples I could find of

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,220
women in tech I think see you sighs

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,350
divers still on I've tried to erase it

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,659
from all my industry so I don't hear

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,879
about it but I really appreciate you

00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:51,479
doing that for me yeah

00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:55,019
and I was like nope that's my husband so

00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:57,299
so a lot of this is very you know so

00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,190
it's kind of not it's it's not

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,269
surprising that people can't picture

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,919
older women in a technical role and in

00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,729
fact we find this to be the case so I

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:12,449
didn't a number of interviews with women

00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:14,909
over 40 who worked in tech and this is a

00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:18,319
quote from a 57 year old woman and she

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:21,149
said that it was really hard for her to

00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,069
you know get interviews and new jobs so

00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:24,419
like this is during a time when Silicon

00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,029
Valley is poaching each other's

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,469
employees they're working really hard to

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,349
make sure everyone knows like our

00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:33,959
workplace is the funnest like we're

00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:36,239
doing the cutting edges software like

00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:39,209
you know recruiters are aggressive like

00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:41,129
I have I have like gnu/linux in my

00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:43,469
LinkedIn and I get stuff and I'm not a

00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:46,169
sysadmin they don't know I'm over 40 I

00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:48,599
guess but every single company in

00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:53,819
Silicon Valley manages to just manage to

00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:56,129
not hire older women in technology so a

00:20:53,819 --> 00:21:00,659
lot of the older women that you guys

00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:02,609
know this guy I love this one a lot of

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,869
the older women that I talked to they

00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:06,059
said you know I did this for a number

00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:07,919
years and I'm done I'm gonna go do

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,049
something else not because they want to

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,269
have babies not because like you know

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,039
the technology you've changed so fast

00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:15,690
that they couldn't keep up but because

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,079
they were just like I'm too old for this

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,719


00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,339
and they went and they go find another

00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:22,469
career some amounts to do where they

00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:25,169
don't have to put up with the like you

00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:28,649
know weird misconceptions and the you

00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:32,190
know failure to be taken seriously so

00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:34,289
and this finally for the women who do

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,739
stay some of them end up kind of getting

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,690
pushed towards management and so this

00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:41,999
woman said you know she used to really

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,369
like working on technical hard problems

00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:47,249
but over and over again she's been

00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:49,289
pushed to train young people so she get

00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:51,599
to the place where she felt like her

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:53,879
only purpose there was to mentor young

00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,309
people and have them realize their

00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,779
exciting ideas and you could like hang

00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,669
around and teach them how to do the

00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,920
tools and all that kind of stuff and

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,990
she's like I didn't want

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,820
be a manager but like because I'm a

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,970
woman they really wanted me to den

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,890
mother than you coders we're gonna talk

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,500
about volunteering now free software is

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,140
powered by volunteers there are more

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,850
companies who are producing free

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,110
software as and people have convinced

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,670
them that or they've convinced

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,410
themselves that what they're working on

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,910
should be released under a wonderful

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,150
excellent free software license like all

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,850
of your companies should be doing but a

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,440
lot of it is still people who are just

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,960
interested in projects and who want to

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,840
get involved great

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,970
volunteering is super wonderful it's one

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,300
of the places where you can really

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,150
create communities that are multi that

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,430
are multi-generational really diverse

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,020
really inclusive because people are

00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,430
showing up for them because they want to

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,660
be there they're people who want to help

00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,100
out they're people who want to be

00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,880
involved and they're people who are

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,230
really invested in what's going on here

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,150
are some statistics I really like

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,100
statistics and demographics if you can't

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,690
tell yet here are some stuff on

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,660
volunteering when you're looking at

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,780
younger people between the ages of 12

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,160
and 18 you're getting about 55% of them

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,520
volunteering they're coming in with

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,650
about 29 hours per year most of these

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,820
are in youth organizations so things

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,830
that are specifically geared towards

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:23,180
younger people and also religious

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,100
organizations as well get to that in a

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,360
second

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,490
one of the reasons for this in that

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,260
particular age group is that you're

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,910
looking at people who want to go to

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,530
college and while it can be laudable

00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,210
while it can be great while it can be

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,790
wonderful that you care so much about

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,760
something to put in 250 hours of

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,410
volunteer time while you're at universe

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,240
Oh while you're at high school that's

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,120
actually not that impressive according

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:55,280
to an admissions officer at some fancy

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:57,490
school in Cambridge when you're looking

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,890
at retirees you are getting fewer people

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:04,130
total as in rather than 55 percent

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,200
they're coming in at 42% what's really

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,150
great about this though and why this is

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,920
impressive is these are people who

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,720
aren't doing it because they want to go

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,370
to college they're doing it because they

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,540
just want to do something and they want

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,330
to

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,560
that's they're coming in at 96 hours per

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,060
year which is really great

00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,220
again there's there's a lot of

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,500
volunteering and religious organizations

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,390
across the board actually religious

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,280
organizations have the most volunteers

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,750
there are a lot of reasons for this

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,300
historically they've built community is

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,490
also at least in the United States

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,860
because religious organizations are all

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:39,010
nonprofits anything you do for one

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,510
happens to be volunteering there's

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,550
another metric when we're talking about

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,040
volunteers which is how many people are

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,270
hitting over 500 hours a year in

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,280
volunteer time so 10% of elderly

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,440
volunteers accrue that many and this is

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,620
the largest percentage of people in this

00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,850
like wonderful 500 plus hours per year

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:04,690
category and here are some organizations

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:07,090
that are multi-generational so one Molly

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,130
and I want here within bison is girls

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,760
rock camp and this is it's a

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,460
organization run by women for young

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,670
women to help them find a place feel out

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,490
would be proud and play an instrument

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:24,190
and so the there's there's roles for

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:29,440
women of all ages to do mentoring and

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:31,420
then the a lot of the a lot of the kids

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,490
who go through the camp end up being

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,830
camp counselors when they're 16 17 18

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,050
years old and so they've built this like

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,270
you know kind of like every single age

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:42,690
group is represented in there another

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,800
place that we see a lot of

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,560
intergenerational volunteering as

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,690
political campaigns and political

00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,880
campaigns are like show up we will find

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,620
something for you to do I used to work

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,680
primarily in local politics in

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,600
Massachusetts and you know older people

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,460
would show up and stuff envelopes people

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,460
would bring their kids in like all

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,110
different ages and and it was really it

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,580
felt like you know there was a real

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:10,410
torch being passed a lot of amazing

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,790
stories over the envelope stuffing table

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,650
kind of as a quick pitch for that if you

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,890
happen to live near one of the many

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,320
excellent free software and great tech

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,850
for good humanity organizations you

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,730
consider volunteering at them they

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,570
always need people to stuff envelopes

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,460
going back to religious organizations

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,870
you see people like the quake

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,520
they have like the Friends Service

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,840
Committee these are people who go all

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,700
over the world some of them are

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,820
volunteers some of them are employees

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,370
and they're bringing you know these

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,500
these wonderful things to other places

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,320
you also see see this with Unitarian

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,000
Universalists Habitat for Humanity is

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,520
another really great example of this

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,549
because it's an organization that values

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,429
like young people who can run around and

00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:56,169
swing hammers just as much as they value

00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,600
older people who are retired

00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:04,539
electricians who like can totally just

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:06,610
kill like wiring a house so volunteering

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:11,429
is great younger people and older people

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:15,760
like to use their time to do it no

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:18,130
there's also I think well what the point

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,950
of this section is that we could have

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,450
more volunteers if we were able to be

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,820
more welcoming to different age groups

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,320
and and I think it's it's integral to

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,260
the success of the free software

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,230
movement to have an unbroken chain of

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,010
people coming in so we're gonna talk

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,169
about some of the solutions we like we

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,850
would like to see a movement where older

00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,250
people with experience can pass the

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,809
torch to the younger generations while

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:48,370
empowering them to actually make the

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,380
movement their own it's I want people to

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,980
be able to ask each other for advice and

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,720
for folks you know we don't need to put

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,740
a small handful of older people on a

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,120
pedestal and looking to them for advice

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,820
are all kinds of different things that

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,200
they might not even be expert in I'd

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,399
like to see a situation where young

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,370
people and old people can put their

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,200
ideas out there and there the idea is

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,570
judged on its merits not by the age of

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,980
the person who floated the idea so

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,990
that's kind of the the vision there so

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,210
there is some great stuff happening to

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,809
get young people involved Penn manors

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,970
High School where kids help install

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:31,360
software on the computers for the the

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:35,710
rest of the students they also help do

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,389
some of the hardware fixes they you know

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,129
they're learning how to

00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:40,929
like the helpdesk and all of these

00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:43,899
different things and they feel really

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,269
part of the IT department at their

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:49,509
school which is really exciting

00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:51,459
OSU that's open Oregon State University

00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:52,989
they have an open-source laboratory they

00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:55,389
host a lot of amazing free software

00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:57,820
projects on their servers but students

00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:59,579
are training to be sis admins and

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,659
learning how to do DevOps type stuff

00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:03,279
through the school and so it's like a

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,829
really great place where they're

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,320
teaching their students about the

00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,729
importance of giving back to the free

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,919
and open-source software community but

00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:14,499
also like giving them the actual

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,440
specific skills to like host a server

00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:19,570
and deal with emails and calls about

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,879
outages and things like that kept a

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:24,459
quick sec yeah so if you are a professor

00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:26,649
or a teacher consider assigning projects

00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:28,559
where people can get involved in free

00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:31,629
software

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,089
oh it's more me okay great

00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:36,159
there are maker days some places have

00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:38,979
them you know there are simple projects

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,679
designed to be comfortable and welcoming

00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:43,299
and friendly and easy there are two

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,829
particular organizations who don't

00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:46,359
necessarily host maker days but I've

00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:49,690
taken the idea of what maker days

00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:52,419
accomplish one of them is like a summer

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,369
camp after-school program called parts

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,919
and crafts who've constructed these

00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,200
pretty simple kits based around

00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,669
interesting things in technology that

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,649
they then send out to you and you can

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,629
build them and play with them but all of

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,459
their documentation is under an open

00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:08,200
document is under the open documentation

00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:11,529
license which means that they're also

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,119
encouraging people to go and modify the

00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,649
documentation to kind of make notes

00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,359
about things that they did with it that

00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:19,269
were either difficult or exciting or new

00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,609
or how they changed it public labs is a

00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:23,859
citizen science group that also designs

00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:25,959
tools and they also you know they're

00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,089
part of the open hardware Association

00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:30,729
and they are also producing all their

00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:33,159
documentation under an open

00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:36,190
documentation license to encourage

00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,509
people to again make these changes to

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,309
share them to participate in these

00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:41,950
communities like in these free

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:44,859
technology communities in pretty simple

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:47,139
starting ways there's scratch and

00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,350
minecraft and maybe other things I

00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:52,000
learned recently that I'm old now too

00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:57,190
not an advanced worker but I'm old

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,330
according to some statistics I read so I

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,309
don't know what the kids are doing these

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,289
days but you know there are these

00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:05,260
wonderful tools that are designed to be

00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:06,809
easy and to introduce oh there's little

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,340
bits little bits is also super cool

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,799
there are these tools designed to make

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,510
getting involved in things in developing

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,059
some kind of technical skills or at

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,260
least technical understandings about how

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:20,260
things are put together and how

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,450
technology works also there are kids

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:26,730
days at big Foss conferences those are

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,110
super cool I hear they're really fun I'm

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:33,330
don't think I'd be allowed to go to them

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:36,100
unless I borrowed someone's child no no

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,929
kids actually give presentations and I

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,710
saw an adorable ten-minute presentation

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:43,929
on how awesome open hatches from someone

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:48,030
who had to stand on something to be seen

00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:50,530
over the podium that was pretty great

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:53,590
but yeah there's if you already have the

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,200
space then why not set some space aside

00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,789
for kids and you know then people can

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,590
bring their kids instead of leave them

00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:04,210
at home oh yeah so some great stuff

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,640
that's happening to get older people

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,230
involved if people are not already

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,990
familiar with outreach it's pretty

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,210
awesome it's a paid internship to work

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,270
on free and open source software but

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,470
it's not only for students and it's it's

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,030
specifically for people from

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,309
underrepresented groups like women and

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,840
other minorities but a lot of the people

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,610
who take advantage of it or women who

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,980
are returning to the workforce so it's

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,450
very exciting they're their fundraising

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,940
now because they're part of the

00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,460
Conservancy with a match they just they

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,340
just kicked off a donation match

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,690
supporter membership funding dry I just

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,919
threw too many words in their funding

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,360
drive so if you're not a member you

00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,799
should become one hundred fifty people

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,299
and they'll get a great match donation

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,309
they're great yeah that's our club open

00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,890
search comm which is a website that has

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,260
articles and interviews about people

00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,929
working in free and open source software

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:59,290
they have a really diverse age pool of

00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:01,010
participation it's great because writing

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,290
is one of those things

00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,900
it takes a little less time to get

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,030
acclimated to doing than code so it's

00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,950
really great for people who have like a

00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,500
little bit of time or don't want to do

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,560
something technical but want to help I

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,510
think there are also a number of online

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,730
resources that are designed to help you

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,800
learn how to code what's great about

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,810
them is especially code Academy is it's

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,820
not where it introduces you to some kind

00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,590
of technical concept and that in the

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,330
hopes that your beautiful wonderful

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,220
creative mind will somehow make the leap

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,160
to application like how to think like a

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,720
computer scientist does so those are

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,910
cool and and volunteering with the

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,430
community run conferences is also really

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,570
great a lot of them have spaces for

00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,760
people to kind of sit behind an

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,500
information desk and just like hand out

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,540
programs and talk about stuff and those

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,510
are all on ramps for becoming involved

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,670
with a community the key there is like

00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,440
the next batch of things is to make sure

00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:57,020
that the language that you put out when

00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,850
you're looking for volunteers makes it

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,040
clear that you know you're not only

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,470
looking for like young hipsters or

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,260
something that you're you have lots of

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,300
different types of activities and and

00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,810
that's the case with this with the

00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,360
things in this category like sure I'm

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,750
sure people are familiar with these

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,790
concepts but these can be really great

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,919
ways to bring in a diverse group of

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,620
people from different ages and different

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,780
backgrounds if the language is correct

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,600
and welcoming and you know you take out

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,639
all the rockstar stuff or like we're

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,220
gonna you know we're gonna hang out this

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,350
conference and never sleep and that type

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,850
of thing that doesn't mean you have to

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,000
sleep I'm not I'm not

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,950
well I die I'm a fan of sleep but but if

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,250
you put out language and you think like

00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:48,710
huh would I respond to that if I was 50

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,419
and then figure out why not you can also

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,090
ask people if you're not sure how your

00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:56,120
language looks actually in in studies

00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:58,970
done with language in advertising for

00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,640
jobs and like internship and mentorship

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,680
programs you get higher numbers of

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,240
applicants who are in minority groups

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,330
once your language switches to things

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,520
like mentorship and learning and

00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,900
community and groups and like spaces for

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,850
you to expand when you have that kind of

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,049
language as opposed to language like be

00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,369
a rock star

00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,230
the number of applicants is just

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,119
completely different right so the if you

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,589
set the expectation like we'll bring you

00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,880
in and teach you as opposed to you

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:28,089
should already be XYZ sort of person so

00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,549
some stuff that we'd like to see happen

00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:34,010
is ways for kids to do non code stuff

00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:35,869
like scratching minecraft are cool but I

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,490
don't know there must be nerdy children

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:39,650
out there that want to do documentation

00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,630
maybe or something like that but that's

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:47,569
the point of public labs and parts and

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:50,089
crafts yeah and more places for older

00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:52,990
people to do non code stuff I think you

00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:54,980
had a point about this that a lot of

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,359
older people once they're retired

00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,069
they've been in the workforce they know

00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,540
how to do accounting they know how to do

00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:02,420
event work they know how to do writing

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,460
and they could do it for us in the free

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,960
software movement we just have to make

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,869
sure they know that we want them to come

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:13,700
over that's yeah there are plenty of

00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,559
people who leave work to have children

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,660
some of them are mothers and some of

00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,040
them are fathers and making the

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,470
transition from being a stay-at-home

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,270
parent to working full-time or even

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,609
part-time is hard under the best

00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,380
circumstances as far as I can tell I

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,299
don't have children

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,799
neither does Deb no you didn't need to

00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,069
know that about that some of that about

00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:36,079
us I'm sorry

00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:37,940
and it's especially rough in technology

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,049
though when you're looking at things

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,270
that are moving forward that are

00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,980
changing pretty rapidly you know if you

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,359
have your experience from a few years

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,369
ago and everybody was doing cool stuff

00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,140
with Java and then suddenly everybody

00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,280
wants c-sharp programmers and you're

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:55,250
just like I don't you know what c-sharp

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,930
is o youth and junior affinity groups

00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,030
within communities there are a lot of

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,760
good examples of this outside of

00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,680
technology like there are like Young

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,460
Republicans and Young Democrats there

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,109
are youth groups within churches so

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,970
maybe we should have some more youth

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:13,790
groups and free software you had an idea

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:20,150
for the other vets you wanted for the

00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:22,640
debian yeah yeah and all ages events at

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,990
conferences we're really bringing back

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,549
this event thing again and again and

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,160
part of that is that events are really

00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:29,660
fun and it's much easier to be

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,730
excited about being involved in a

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,740
community when you already like the

00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,170
people there and you have emotional

00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,819
investment in them so one way this can

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,700
look is when you have your social event

00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:43,069
at night don't just go to a bar I mean

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,230
the bars are fun and we're not saying

00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:47,150
don't go to a bar at all the point is

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,420
have other things that are going on as

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:52,160
well maybe you want to have like a game

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,079
night or a game space next to another

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,640
space which is what scale does I believe

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,710
yes scale does it starts out

00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,440
family-friendly game night and then

00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,690
people kind of trickle in from the bar

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,089
and then it like the kids go to bed and

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,210
it switches over and I add one Deb Kampf

00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:10,250
in Portland the night started out with

00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,809
games and then it later transitioned to

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,809
all the adults just drinking lots of

00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:16,700
wine and the key is to be clear if it's

00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,990
gonna be family-friendly say so so

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,940
people know to bring their kids and then

00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,200
if it's not you also say so so you

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,299
couldn't have two different kinds of

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,109
events or you can have a mixed event or

00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:28,280
something like that so making space is

00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:29,630
really important we're running out of

00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,059
time I'm gonna talk a little more

00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,789
quickly I'm sorry making space is really

00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,500
important this doesn't just mean having

00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:38,119
places where people can be vulnerable

00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,039
and share that they don't understand

00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,859
things but also to make spaces for

00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,440
people to move up or progress right you

00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:47,710
need to be comfortable sitting down when

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,970
someone else has the turn to stand up

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,160
and some ways to do this you can have

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,510
someone shadow you you can make sure

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,329
that you're sort of spreading out your

00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:59,270
work and you have people who are always

00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:01,369
learning like a piece of what you do if

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,099
you're the senior person yeah having new

00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:08,930
people do keynotes is a great way to do

00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:10,400
that and I had another thought but I

00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,319
remember sorry so here's a call to

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,119
action which means you should start to

00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:19,160
think about your questions so uh we want

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,869
you to find ways to bring people in to

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,109
communities and make them feel

00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:26,150
comfortable and you know to communicate

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:29,150
what is awesome about your community for

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,250
people of all different ages so you know

00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,770
making sure that if if you do actually

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,140
want like a full age spectrum of people

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,750
that your language reflects that and

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,400
then when they do show up

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,830
sure you empower these new folks to

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,780
become like real decision making members

00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,210
of your community who are like truly

00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,280
empowered to participate and be involved

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,690
in all aspects so you gave them access

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,250
to important information make sure

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:55,580
they're invited to all the meetings and

00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,260
that kind of thing so that way then you

00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,200
can just like get out of their way and

00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:02,540
they'll bring in more new people so this

00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,830
is how you avoid having it be tokenistic

00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,780
real quick

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,550
kind of anecdote on that is sp I

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,680
recently added a member to their board

00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,880
who'd only been really involved with

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,710
free software for I think about a year

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,480
at that point and she was just super

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:21,740
enthusiastic cool so you can tweet at us

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:27,320
or other social platforms with that tag

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:30,170
or these are Twitter handles and then we

00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,050
would be happy to take your questions so

00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:39,380
thanks so much for listening

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:44,460
[Applause]

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:46,530
okay it's not Chappell by the way it's

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,180
not Chappell by the way and why should

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,370
being a doctor be any better than being

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,950
a nurse being a good nurse is fantastic

00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:55,380
[Music]

00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,680
anyway I'm standing up so people can see

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,300
that I'm old I don't look good in a

00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,460
t-shirt right

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,050
I can't I came last night to the

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,750
delirium tremens and the guy at the door

00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,430
quizzed me as if I were some belt fat

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,080
Belgian walk who was trying to wander

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,300
into the delirium tremens and I had to

00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,120
prove my chops by talking about penguins

00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:18,120
that I came to a little conference

00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,230
called off steam 17 years ago me and 400

00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,630
other people from Europe came to the

00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,460
original Austin conference people change

00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,310
people get older and we don't all have

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:39,990
beards and and t-shirts with with them

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:43,760
geckos and and on them ok great so

00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,760
fantastic talk thank you thank you

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:52,279
I guess I also have less of a question

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,099
but one of the one of the things you

00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:57,859
mentioned finding non-code of things for

00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:59,420
young people and older people to do one

00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,980
of the things I found that has been

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,109
super good for both the youngest and the

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,259
oldest is making kind of explanation

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:08,839
videos people love making these videos

00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:11,480
where they teach people their age how to

00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,799
do stuff or teach people in like in the

00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,809
older generations younger than them in

00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:16,670
many cases but like for the young people

00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:18,680
they love teaching like they're their

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,900
classmates and having videos explaining

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,339
how to do stuff and those are super easy

00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,839
to get people to do if you give them a

00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,700
video and as soon as they see a few

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,519
people liking their thing there don't do

00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:35,509
tons cool and there was a question over

00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:38,180
there you you said that you would say

00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:40,849
why 35 is important and I think I missed

00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,730
it because I only were 35 is important

00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:45,920
oh yeah 30 so 35 is important like as a

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,259
demographic point because like they

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,789
separate people into older than 35 and

00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:55,940
younger especially when looking at like

00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:57,829
shopping but the VC guy he said that you

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:08,869
know people over 35 don't have good

00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:09,549
ideas are they good yeah that's a great

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:14,990
idea

00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:18,380
other places oh yes hi great talk thank

00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,480
you and I work at a tech company and on

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,480
the diversity team and we often struggle

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,250
with representation on panels so I did a

00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,109
quick count of the number of speakers at

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,880
FOSDEM today there are men and the

00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:32,809
number of women what is your advice in

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:36,559
kind of inclusive inclusivity in terms

00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:38,839
of representation events like this so I

00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,400
think that like the biggest thing that

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,500
you can do to get a diverse

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,519
representation on a panel is to start

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,079
really early so if you ask the same for

00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,299
women that everyone asked to be on a

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,859
panel on a particular topic three weeks

00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:54,890
before that panel they're all going to

00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:56,480
be busy and say no so if you have this

00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,400
idea that you want to have a panel and

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,930
you want it to be diverse then you need

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,270
be asking people a few months in advance

00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,160
so especially women who may have

00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,260
childcare duties and other things they

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,619
have to jostle around before they can

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,599
commit you have to start early it's a

00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,609
lot of it's like it's pretty heavily

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,980
based on outreach so you really have to

00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,420
be willing to go where people are I

00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,099
don't know if you're talking about like

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,049
within the context of a company or a

00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:22,819
project but part of that also might just

00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:24,980
be trying to get more people like

00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:27,020
working for it in general and thinking

00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,700
about recruitment strategies one of the

00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,890
biggest things you can do is explicitly

00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,510
change your language and not just

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,970
focusing on things like mentorship or

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:37,220
learning or growth but also focusing on

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,559
like pretty explicitly stating hey you

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:46,940
know this is our anti-discrimination

00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:48,770
policy say like can you recommend

00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,230
someone up-and-coming that I might not

00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,990
be aware of who could participate on

00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,089
this panel I have a great secret list of

00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:58,160
semi secret lists of really awesome

00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:00,470
minority free and open source software

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,710
speakers so you could like hit me up for

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,710
it

00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,190
hi first of all I'd like to say I agree

00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,930
with you on the whole I think older

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,640
people like I think a lot about my mom

00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,079
who's interested in free software feel

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,720
like they're being told that this is not

00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,039
really for them and there is something

00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,329
quite subversive in telling them

00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,670
actually it is for you and you should

00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:24,529
not feel excluded from this and you can

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,630
understand it a lot of older people are

00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:28,190
basically being told give up it's not

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,930
for you or buy this expensive shiny

00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,760
thing they'll do it for you so I agree

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,029
with you on the whole my question

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,619
however is more about some some stuff

00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:39,950
I've seen online basically some sort of

00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:42,349
elitist old-school hacker Eric Raymond

00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,339
crap that is telling us oh yeah but

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:45,650
we're just going to try and get the

00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:49,460
special snowflakes in and dilute our

00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:52,190
elite skills how do we go back against

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,849
that it's it's clearly quite stupid we

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,470
need more people yeah what's your advice

00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,660
about that I want to make a really quick

00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:02,720
comment about your comment which is my

00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:04,309
mother works in IT and she's like oh

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,990
free software isn't for me it's too hard

00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:09,339
and complicated I'm not sure I could use

00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:11,559
it so I face this problem all the time

00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:13,269
yeah so

00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,809
I think what you're kind of getting at

00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:19,449
is that like this I think sort of

00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,099
mythical idea that by making our

00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:25,180
communities more diverse we're somehow

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:28,209
lowering the bar which I I mean one I

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,709
think that's Foss like it's really easy

00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:30,939
to create communities that are

00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:33,249
comfortable for the people who are

00:46:30,939 --> 00:46:35,199
already there and it's a matter of

00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:37,239
figuring out like do you want more

00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,299
diverse participation than it means like

00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,799
you know education is a really good

00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:43,989
example like you talk to people in

00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,119
they're like oh yeah like so I invited

00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:48,609
teachers to come to our 8:30 p.m.

00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,499
meetings guess what teachers at least in

00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,809
the u.s. think it up like really really

00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:55,989
early it's not that they want like

00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:58,630
special hand-holding treatment it's that

00:46:55,989 --> 00:47:00,579
they're in bed you know so so a lot of

00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,180
times it's something like that that's

00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:05,859
not that's like could be logistical or

00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,469
it could be a language thing that's like

00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:10,150
you know if your company has

00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:12,039
mustache-growing contest then you're not

00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,079
gonna have a ton of women applying not

00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,939
because they're like special snowflakes

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,739
but because they're like yeah that

00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:20,170
sounds like a bunch of man babies that I

00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:23,259
don't want to work with anyone who says

00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,939
to you that by including more people

00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,589
from underrepresented groups into your

00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:31,449
project as lowering the bar is actually

00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:34,029
just wrong there's been I hear some

00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:36,729
clapping yes there there you know there

00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:38,769
have been Studies on this right when you

00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,929
encourage you like when you encourage

00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:44,799
women to take math classes they do

00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:47,079
better than men do on average right and

00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:50,289
when you encourage like people of color

00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,989
to participate in like academic field

00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:56,589
that you know when you're like oh they

00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:58,150
can't you're like oh I'm sorry they're

00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:59,949
specifically a thing about swimming

00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,150
that's an example here there's this kind

00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:03,130
of like thing where it's like black

00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,439
people can't swim but it turns out that

00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:12,609
black swimmers do better than white

00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:13,959
swimmers frequently thank you for the

00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:16,689
presentation thank you for the

00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:18,789
inspiration the recipes the guidelines

00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:22,479
that you try can find myself in in all

00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:24,550
of those I myself also involved in a

00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:27,490
couple of

00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:29,920
public and social initiatives under the

00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:33,460
radar for the common good Chitra Chitra

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:37,270
now through the years what bothers me is

00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:41,350
that yeah in the end you have to find

00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:44,640
the kind of win-win situation where you

00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:47,680
can find a ensure balance between engage

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,380
motivation and interest and at the end

00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,170
getting a product or service that is for

00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:57,610
the common good because we are mainly

00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:01,510
here working on open source in this case

00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:04,119
now did you come to sometimes the

00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:07,810
reflection that despite all those

00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:11,080
recipes and guidelines you can not find

00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:13,900
every time on systematically the right

00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,730
balance the right match to get all the

00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,300
people involved that you would like to

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:23,350
involve and engage and that at the end

00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,869
you miss something that you can find in

00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:31,119
the private sector being paying people

00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:33,550
for work it's out and I don't have the

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,380
answer myself but it's a recurrent

00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:40,570
so-die I ask myself okay we're all

00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,280
engaging all those people for producing

00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:45,070
something for the common good for

00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:51,510
everyone in fact but and the other

00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:51,510
science work deserves compensation but

00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:02,200
later I have some thoughts on it thank

00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,430
you again for coming and we look forward

00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,359
to working with you on building and

00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,359
all-ages fast movement

00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,110
