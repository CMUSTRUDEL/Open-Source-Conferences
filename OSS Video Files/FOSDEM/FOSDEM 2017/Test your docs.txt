Documentation is essential for potential users to understand your awesomecoding efforts.

But I know that you'd rather get back to coding as soon as possible, so howabout automating as much of your documentation as possible?

In this presentation I will show you how to automate some of the repetitivetasks involved in documentation and make your colleagues jealous.

  * Testing docs  * Spell and grammar checking  * Generating screenshots  * Building different versions and formats  * Notifications  * Generating videos

I will show you how to build workflows and plugins for several populardocumentation editors and CI tools and give you more free time to watch catvideos, complain about important issues, or get replaced by a robot.
