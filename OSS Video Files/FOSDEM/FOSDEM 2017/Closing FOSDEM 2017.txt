section in your booklets there's a

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,920
feedback section on the internet there's

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,480
a feedback email address we really want

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,879
to have your feedback just to track

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,610
what's good what's bad what's got better

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,180
what's got worse please give your

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:45,850
feedback thank you there is something

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:49,220
rather important to say about what

00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:52,879
internet service we provide so basically

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:56,570
we do provide 2 SS IDs on the premise

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,750
nowhere else and these are false demand

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,119
fosston ancient we do not and did not at

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,830
any point provide any Internet I said

00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:09,200
after when you or with a different name

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,909
we have been informed and confirmed that

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,689
there were several attempts to steal

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,179
usernames and passwords of people one

00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:20,420
example would be the usage of fosston

00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:25,460
free Wi-Fi by Google as the SSID it

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:28,789
showed a login page this was not us this

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,359
was not Google this was someone else we

00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:36,530
are taking action with whoever's

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:39,560
responsible for this if you think you

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,929
might have been affected by this please

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,149
go through that URL we will also put

00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:47,659
this on the website we will send out

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,030
email we will put up the slides versus

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,009
the URL you want to go to if you have

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,719
been or might have been affected by this

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:59,950
or anyone you know might have been

00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:02,869
affected anything also if you want to

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,439
contact us regarding anything regarding

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,100
this matter

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,869
security at FOSDEM org use this GPT

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,130
fingerprint again we will be publishing

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:17,570
this on our web site we will be putting

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:19,510
up the slides that's all to be said

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,400
about this

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:27,249
so this is a lot shorter than usually is

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,769
we had four keynotes we had six 644 650

00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:40,489
50 40 thank you

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:43,400
45 we even have one more room for next

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:50,719
year which is totally awesome so we get

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,950
in more tracks more deference and all

00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:57,500
the other stats will probably be

00:02:51,950 --> 00:03:01,040
uploaded later some ipv6 or it some

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,599
interest ATS these are the number of

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,939
addresses we have on the different days

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,879
for link-local on ipv6 on globally

00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:11,000
routable people who manually configured

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:16,519
ipv4 and D configured v6 you are bad

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,430
people please stop and if things break

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,569
file box with your vendors or your

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,519
developers or whoever found you that and

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:28,009
also as of this afternoon

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,709
we had a total of eleven thousand six

00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:32,870
hundred ish MAC addresses this is

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:37,060
probably quite a bit more by now

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,949
and we didn't have weird people claiming

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,759
tons of MAC address so this is actually

00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:46,729
about the number for devices for video

00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,439
we had 600 megabit in peak if you want

00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:51,799
more details you can also look at -

00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:55,159
portavoz de morgue something which I did

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,659
not manage to put into the slides most

00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,180
of the videos are a lot of the videos

00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:01,879
are already cut and should be available

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,040
shortly if you're a speaker if you're a

00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,229
deaf room manager you will have got an

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,359
email for review links please do this

00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,129
this makes it unlocked quicker for

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:14,469
everyone to get your content and also a

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,469
lot less work for us so that's nice

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,280
something just to show and fill fill

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,709
space basically this is our new video

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,300
dashboard at the NOC or at the walk we

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,729
can see the stream the input the output

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,580
and the life updates of what's happening

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:31,770
in braking you can also have a look at

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,990
our one server and router this

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:39,690
a lot better than last year because it's

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:43,830
not balancing on chairs we have an

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,080
actual rack which is really nice and if

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,229
you want to see a really

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,349
state-of-the-art render farm which is

00:04:48,229 --> 00:05:06,539
modern tuned like if it was done like

00:04:52,349 --> 00:05:10,380
five years ago that's that okay

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:12,900
and also we solved those off at coast to

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,159
attendees and will most likely do the

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,030
next the same thing next year

00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,280
because this is cheaper than renting

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,360
which is kind of perverse but that's the

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,819
way it is so to go to this thank yous

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,580
there should be logos up here and that's

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,550
entirely my fault so any sponsors please

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,520
come yell at me and not force them as

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,680
general this was a time issue next year

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,880
it'll be better so first of all for the

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
venue you'll be

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:57,120

00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:04,280
say all right also it goes back way way

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,740
way back to the traditional fossum which

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,810
has been taking over and which is really

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,060
great so it's very nice to see for some

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,980
live on this way the story goes back

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,260
even to people before us who were in a

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,730
hurry and and they were explaining how

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,920
much they were in a hurry and running

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,390
around which led to the following

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,450
awesome dance move for which you need to

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:26,630
stand on one foot and then the other

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,640
foot will be shaking backwards together

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,860
with our movements going forward and

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,630
that's because first time is always in a

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,850
hurry and always doing their best to

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:42,520
make this awesome for you

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:43,690
