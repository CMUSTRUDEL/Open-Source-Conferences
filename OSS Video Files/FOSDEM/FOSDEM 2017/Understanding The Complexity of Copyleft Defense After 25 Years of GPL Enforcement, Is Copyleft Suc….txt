	Understanding The Complexity of Copyleft Defense After 25 Years of GPL Enforcement, Is Copyleft Succeeding?
by Bradley M. Kuhn

At: FOSDEM 2017

After 25 years of copyleft enforcement and compliance work, is copyleftsucceeding as a strategy to defend software freedom? This talk explores thehistory of enforcement of the GPL and other copyleft licenses, and considersthis question carefully. Attendees who have hitherto not followed the currentand past debates about copyleft licenses and their enforcement can attend thistalk and learn the background, and can expect to learn enough to providesalient and informed feedback of their own opinions about the processes behindupholding copyleft.

The [first GPL enforcement action was done by Richard Stallman against NeXTComputers in 1989](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.en.html),regarding Objective C support in GCC. For 25 years, GPL enforcement hasremained a regular but rarely mainstream activity in Open Source and FreeSoftware projects. Very few projects enforce their[copyleft](https://copyleft.org/) licenses; most live with regular violationsand merely ignore them, or simply beg violators to comply.

Even under the now-published and publicly discussed [Community Principles ofGPL Enforcement](https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html), co-drafted by Software Freedom Conservancy andthe Free Software Foundation, GPL enforcement is regularly criticized andquestioned. Those of us who enforce the GPL get wildly inconsistent feedbackfrom the community: some copyright holders recruit organizations likeConservancy and FSF to enforce as much as possible, others often complainingthat we simply don't enforce enough, and still others call for a completemoratorium on GPL enforcement.

Meanwhile, not all enforcement abides by community principles. For-profitenforcers, who have existed for decades, use copyleft licenses in a manner notintended by the license drafters: to captiously convince "customers" that theymust buy proprietary licenses, or otherwise pay, to incorporate Open Sourceand Free Software into their products.

This complex landscape has become almost impenetrable for the average FLOSSdevelopers who merely wish their code to remain forever free and libre. Thistalk will provide the basic history and background information about the stateof copyleft in our community, and set the stage for all developers to giveinformed feedback to organizations that stand up for copyleft.

um GPL

00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:12,650
enforcement or GPL compliance and with

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,160
the experience of doing that for 25

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,470
years

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,490
and I'm running really happy to

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,890
introduce you

00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,140
Bradley Caan who's one of the very few

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,000
if not the only person on this planet

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,640
who has this experience of doing this

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,220
GPL work for 25 years so I'm all

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,350
thrilled to listen to what he has to say

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:43,100
give him a very warm welcome Bradley

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:44,750
come please so I think the most

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,760
important thing to remember about my

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,100
talk is not what I'm gonna say but how

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,800
important this event is this events run

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,660
by a community of volunteers it is the

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,699
most important free-software event in

00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,820
the world every year it has the most

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,600
attendees and it is non-commercial

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,109
community oriented and fair and friendly

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,109
and

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,450
there are only three or four events like

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,160
that left in our community because

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,920
they've been taken over by other

00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,960
interests and this is by far the largest

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,840
so that's the most important thing I

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,710
have to say you can only know my slides

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,110
are online

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,970
anything that's in blue is a link so

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,470
feel free to follow along and when you

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,150
get bored just click through the links

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:37,000
and read those instead I've done a lot

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,729
of talks about copyleft as most of you

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,450
probably know I see people out there who

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,920
have seen a lot of them I work for an

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,619
organization called the software freedom

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,869
Conservancy we do a lot of different

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:51,759
things we spend a lot of different time

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,100
on things that are not licensed

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,950
informatin forcement or anything to do

00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:01,479
with licenses my colleague stayed up to

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,550
4:00 a.m. this time zoned to get a bunch

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,410
of logistics done for a conference for

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,560
one of our projects last night while I

00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,910
was working on this talk I spent some of

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,690
the afternoon working on this talk but

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,690
also importing our donation system and

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,370
fixing it but people always want to hear

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,080
about copyleft so I tend to talk about

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,670
that more than any other topic that we

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,370
do I suppose you don't want to hear

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,700
about how our paypal imports Perl script

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,780
works

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,959
yes it's written in Perl I'm sorry so I

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,489
think most importantly free software

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,850
developers need to know the whole story

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,370
of what's going on there are a lot of

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,560
things happening in the politics of

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,060
copyleft and my colleague Karen Sandler

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,920
my work with keeps telling me not to use

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,140
the word politics but there are lots of

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,700
politics so I'm not the type of person

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,160
that's going to cover up what things

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,340
really are and most of you don't know

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,049
what is going on with those politics

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,570
fortunately because I work for a charity

00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,549
not a company not a trade association I

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,049
have a tremendous amount of freedom it's

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,190
the best job I've ever had I hope to

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:08,739
retire from it someday and I have not

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,570
only the freedom but an obligation as an

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,190
employee of a charity to really tell you

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,130
what the real story is at least from our

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,660
point of view in fact Conservancy I

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,389
think is even more transparent than most

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,579
charities and we operate I think as the

00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,019
most transparent organization in the

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,139
open source and free software community

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,139
by

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,220
those of you have seen my talks before

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,580
know that I like to put stuff about

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,160
philosophers up on my slides I like

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,240
first principles I like the idea of

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,340
applying the humanities to this world of

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,100
science I think interdisciplinary

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:50,200
thought is important I'm capable of

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:55,240
laughing at it as well but I really

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:59,530
cared about ideas and morality and right

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,880
and wrong and doing good in the world so

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,620
I want to start out by giving the brief

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,320
tale of how I ended up caring so much

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,460
about copyleft I went to what we call in

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,680
the u.s. a liberal arts university I was

00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,410
primarily studying computer science but

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,989
we had excessive requirements some

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,200
thought in going to philosophy and

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:23,230
literature courses but I was a geek of

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,630
course and I had never owned my own

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,190
computer I know that sounds bizarre to

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,900
the younger people in the audience but

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,690
until I got to college I never on my

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,310
computer and my own computer so I wanted

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,140
to buy one so I bought something that

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,880
looked a lot like this I actually got it

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,460
from Sager I could not find any picture

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,500
of 1992 era Sager laptops so this is I

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,220
think it's a Shiba model but it looked a

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,900
lot like that

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,400
I couldn't find any personal pictures of

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,980
it well apparently I didn't like take

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,230
photos of my computer like I did with my

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,870
dogs now so there's not any photos of

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:56,230
that computer I don't think but I got it

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,180
and it was well known around campus one

00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,190
of my literature professors whom I liked

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,070
I went back to see him in the early

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,360
2000s I had him for three classes I

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,100
didn't expect him to remember me he said

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,570
of course I remember you you were the

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,070
first person to ever bring a laptop to

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,520
one of my classes now they all bring

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,520
those things

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:15,749
and now I got it this way I didn't have

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,909
an internet access

00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:20,069
you used to buy this magazine was called

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,680
the computer shopper it was giant it was

00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,689
this thick it was like six dollars and

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,389
fifty cents which was a pretty expensive

00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,650
magazine in 1992 and you'd page through

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,509
it and you look at all the computers for

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,699
sale and you'd use this thing called a

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,139
telephone and I'm not talking about like

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,460
that that device you have in your pocket

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,560
now this was a thing connected to a

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,509
twisted-pair line to a central office

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,949
that sort of stuff and you call him up a

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,409
new door a computer and they send it to

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,020
you now I had already been using UNIX I

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,889
had access to a UNIX system at work

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,840
unfortunately that point only access to

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,210
a VMS system at school but I knew UNIX

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,990
was the best operating system available

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,150
and I need to find one for my little

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,669
sager laptop there well X wasn't so

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,110
little it was like 35 pounds I don't

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,699
have a exercisin kilos it was it was

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,199
heavy that's why I think every laptop I

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,789
had is like I'm free rolling because

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,770
every laptop I've ever had is lighter

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,870
than that one ever since then so hey I

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,330
carried around 35 pounds around campus

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,069
what's the big deal so I started reading

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,960
this news group because I had Euston

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,629
access but I never access so I was

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,490
reading compo s MINIX and read this well

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,509
in what Usenet was called real-time it

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,250
was a few days after it was posted

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,779
because it took that long for the

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,000
message to get to you but a few days

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,529
after this posted I read it because I

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,719
was reading Campos mimics to see if I

00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:34,409
could get mimics running on that sager

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:35,939
pc and then found out that hey this

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:38,039
linux thing might be coming along when I

00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,680
get my sacred PC I can install this

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,120
Linux thing and one of the things that

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,819
was very interesting to me was that word

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,899
that's still very interesting to me

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,310
because for me software was going to be

00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,629
a profession but it was also going to be

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,180
a hobby had already been a hobby for

00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,000
many years and I like this idea of

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,319
writing something as a hobby because

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,719
hobby is for people who bought this

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,310
thing every month hobby is for people

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:04,589
who would buy a device like that and

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,569
carry it around a campus it was heavy I

00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,710
to batteries for it too because that you

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,629
need to switch batteries in the middle

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:15,479
of a 45-minute class because you ran out

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:21,029
and the great thing that when I

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:22,879
downloaded the 30 floppies of SLS slack

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,840
we didn't exist yet when I installed

00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,419
Linux for the first time

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,100
I actually was able to patch Linux I was

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,090
able to change things I changed Linux

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,290
and I should have submitted them

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,820
upstream I'd actually be a copyright

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,260
holder now and they wouldn't be able to

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,270
accuse me of not being a copyright

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,580
holder but I've never seen any my

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,860
patches upstream by the way that one of

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,720
the patches I made the the did you know

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,280
that there was no that there was the

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,650
fight over Nitin systemd but there was

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,780
no NIT system in the early Linux when

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,540
you hit control-alt-delete it literally

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,070
called halt in the source code I

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,150
commented that out so in case I hit

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,229
control-alt-delete I didn't want the

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,320
computer to halt

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,700
so I gots a patch right so I discovered

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,740
copyleft because of this I started using

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,870
free software and started using Emacs as

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,090
well and since all a copy of the GPL I

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,620
now this definition of copyleft didn't

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,570
exist at the time when I discovered it

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,070
but it's a really good definition so you

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,960
have the benefit of the years of people

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,790
honing this definition which originally

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,490
comes from what keep from Wikipedia and

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,110
now is on copyleft org but the most

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,130
important word I want to draw to your

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,949
attention is strategy copyleft is not a

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,460
principle it's a strategy it's not a

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:32,610
moral imperative as Kant might say it is

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,130
a method to achieve an important moral

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,250
imperative that's the moral imperative

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,130
from my point of view making sure that

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,690
every individual who has software on

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,940
their computer has the right to copy

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,880
modify distribute and install those

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,800
modifications on their laptop or

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,620
whatever Hardware they have and share

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,029
them with other people that's in my view

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,589
something that should be an inalienable

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,040
right I think it should be in the UN

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,690
Declaration of Human Rights in fact

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,839
copyleft on the other hand is not a

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,850
principle like that is it is a strategy

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,720
that we invented particularly Stallman

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:14,060
invented to help us get there to that

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,830
moral imperative help us reach that goal

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,480
so since it's only a strategy it's not a

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,670
principle you could throw away

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,870
strategies and make up new ones you

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,310
should be very careful about throwing my

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,010
principles particularly first principles

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,290
but we can ask the question of copyleft

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,820
is working at all people keep asking me

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,529
that over and over again in fact so I

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,990
have find myself answering it very often

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:37,620
I'm pretty sure the only way we can

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,339
answer it requires us to have access to

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,379
multiple

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,910
universe is one of which all the

00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,889
software with free software was copy

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,110
lefted and all the software and the

00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,339
other universe was non copy lefted if we

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,860
could look at those two parallel

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,699
universes we could figure out what the

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,620
better strategy was but even if this you

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:59,370
know the many worlds of quantum states

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,870
whatever that is is true I only know it

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,399
from science fiction I'm not actually I

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:07,050
didn't take any physics I was busy

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:10,889
taking literature and philosophy I think

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:14,089
we can't analyze the parallel universes

00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:16,290
so we have to look at what we have

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,439
what's happened in the past and what

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,240
seems to be happening now and as we do

00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,399
that there are two things that are

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,230
happening more and more these days it's

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,509
reached I think in our entire political

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,649
culture not just the free-software one

00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:36,180
quite a crescendo in recent years months

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,800
and weeks and days there's a lot of

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,600
truth in us I love this word it was a

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,610
word invented by a u.s. comedian named

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,769
Stephen Colbert and the word basically

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,319
means something that has no evidence of

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:49,350
whether it's true or not but it sounds

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,629
if it's as if it's true has the quality

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,639
of possibly being true and therefore is

00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:54,959
easily believed when expressed over and

00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,360
over again

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,939
it's what Noam Chomsky calls concision

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,129
this idea that if you can state an idea

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:04,379
briefly because it's fitting with ideas

00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,999
people already have you're more likely

00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,899
to convince them over to your argument

00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,939
because you're basically just

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,499
reinforcing their confirmation bias

00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:12,899
whereas if you want to explain something

00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:17,459
complicated that might have a lot of ins

00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,870
a lot of outs needing more time what

00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,189
also happens is there's a lot of

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,379
revisionist history happening with

00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:25,829
regard to copyleft here's an interesting

00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,540
example David what house who is a Linux

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,699
developer he's part of our coalition who

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:35,249
enforced the GPL with us asked this

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:38,279
question of Greg cage and Greg said that

00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,959
he does want to see compliance with the

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,480
GPL I think Greg and I have always

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,429
agreed about that but he thinks suing

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,439
them is the suing any violators the

00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:48,120
wrong answer because we've been so

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,650
successful with that without ever suing

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,240
anybody

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,460
that's a bit of revisionist history

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,620
we've been enforcing the GPL for a very

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,870
long time and not just on busybox which

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,200
is probably what I'm better known for

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:04,790
being related with it's been on Linux

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,320
since the advent of the embedded system

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,720
this thing came out

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,360
it ran Linux it had no source code offer

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,650
source code was not available in the

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,120
spring of 2003 a coalition of developers

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,890
whom I helped particularly I helped Erik

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,620
Anderson but also involved was hard

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,990
Delta we all did a GPL enforcement

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,850
action that took about 10 to 12 months

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:32,070
to accomplish at the end of it we not

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,140
only got source code we created a free

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,210
software community if you go back if you

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,130
find the old SV entry of open wrt you

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,400
will see the first check in it matches

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,420
almost byte for byte what we were able

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,240
to achieve from Cisco and Linksys as the

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,430
compliant source release for that device

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,810
that community is still vibrant today

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,020
mitad lee has a fork at the moment but

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,560
both sides of the fork oh this action

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,990
this specific enforcement action for all

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,840
their history I don't know how many code

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,920
got how much code got up streamed from

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,930
open to bare teeth there's a lot of

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,670
upstream crossover now but I don't

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,070
expect that revision Wan had tons of up

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,000
streamable code but it was incredibly

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:17,190
important not just forever w net every

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,740
wrt54g owner but for everyone who has

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,260
ever installed an alternative firmware

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,280
on the router ever in their life they

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:30,930
owe it in some part to this GPL

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,880
enforcement action now Rob LAN Lee who I

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,670
worked with quite a bit on GP law

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,490
enforcement for a while he's against GPL

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,100
enforcement now quite publicly he even

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,930
used he's recently publicly said that he

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,880
used some of the funds he got from GP

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,940
law enforcement to fund a non copyleft

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,040
replacement to busybox I think that's

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,180
great actually I think it's good to

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,310
write more free software whatever

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,700
license it's under but his main

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,290
complaint was that and all the

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,270
enforcement he and I did together I

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,730
never gave him a single upstream patch

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,649
patch to busybox which is true

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:09,510
and I had the good opportunity to see

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:13,139
Rob at Linux contra just last week and

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:15,690
we settled this issue and I think we now

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,519
understand each other I never thought

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,139
that up streaming code was the top

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,899
priority because I don't think it is the

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,870
top priority of the GPL the top priority

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,870
of the GPL and its primary goal is to

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,779
make sure downstream users who wish to

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,790
be developers either knowing it or not

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,230
ie they're gonna serendipitously become

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,070
a developer or they already want to be

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:41,339
have the code to the device in their

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,050
hands and can make actual real use of

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,320
that source code to build a new binary

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:49,440
and then over time as happen with open

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,070
wrt and now the lead project also become

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,750
upstream developers so it's not a

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,610
immediacy of getting upstream code it's

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,560
about developing and building a

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,660
community of upstream and downstream

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:07,709
who's slowly and well and work well

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:11,779
together over time and expand because of

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:15,569
the code promulgating under copyleft

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:17,279
that's why GPL v2 even GPL be to a

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,930
common misconception and people think

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,899
this kind of language is only in v3 it's

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,930
right there in v2 compilation and

00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:28,980
installation matter they really really

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:31,740
matter they mattered when I had my PC

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:37,019
when this was the standard version of

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,220
GPL and that matters even more now in

00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,589
the same conversation this is what

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,760
Mathew Garrett had to say about it he

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,529
put it better than I did I think this is

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,180
what it's really about but certainly

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:52,860
what it was about for me certainly I had

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,060
that thing at 19 and I was doing what

00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:00,240
Matthew is talking about here now the

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,160
kids today as we old people say won't

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,399
have one of these but they're gonna have

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,110
this and it's gonna be running Linux and

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,339
they probably won't right now how the

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,069
source code for it and they'll have one

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,350
of these they probably already do that's

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,660
running Android which is Linux

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,620
underneath and they probably don't have

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,310
the source code for

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,530
and now the refrigerator is gonna have

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,060
Linux we used to talk back in those

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,230
compost MINIX days that eventually your

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,760
toaster will run Linux

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,680
it was a joke then but it's not so much

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,520
of a joke now refrigerator is one step

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,340
away now from toasters and this thing

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,020
now I like TV and most people in our

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,380
community it seems don't like TV shows

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,880
so much but some of us do and your TV is

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,190
probably running Linux if you have one

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,240
in fact this is the first device that a

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,660
lot of people are going to interact with

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,980
this one and that one are the first two

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,470
devices they're gonna see in their lives

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,100
most of the time these days and if

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,160
they're running Linux they might

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,330
actually become a developer but if

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,800
they're running Linux and that's

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,380
violating the GPL which is the case

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,060
right now they won't have the

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,650
opportunity to become a Linux developer

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,930
they will think of his devices as shut

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,920
down and we need enforcement to make

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,870
sure that they can Conservancy has

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,610
fought exactly one busybox lawsuit

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:23,400
against the number of defendants one of

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:25,410
whom was Samsung and in fact Samsung was

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
violating the GPL came into compliance

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,790
which is very good of them to do and it

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,070
spawned yet another community like the

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,540
open debate to you not as big not as

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,910
many people have Samsung TVs as have

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,050
wireless routers but there is a vibrant

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,870
community of people developing an

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,790
alternative firmware for Samsung TVs you

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,490
can actually run your own DVR on an SD

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,440
card on a Samsung TVs exam ego that's

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,530
the kind of innovation that happens when

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,660
you have software freedom now long ago

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,980
when this all started there wasn't tons

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,940
of different markets tons of different

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,820
products running links there were

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,680
wireless routers and there was a guy I

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:04,230
just mentioned Herod Volta Herald ironic

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,170
to say now who's really really angry at

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:11,640
me that I didn't push to sue Linksys in

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,230
Cisco right away and from 2004 to 2013

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,730
he went off and did his own enforcement

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,470
because he thought the enforcement that

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,920
Eric and I were doing on busybox

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:23,580
was not good enough and that more

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,000
lawsuits needed to be filed and he filed

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,580
a lot of them over the years this is of

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,510
course the timeline when Linux was

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,430
rising

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,500
lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit as

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,380
linux rises to be in every device in the

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,200
world so when people say that we've done

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,620
so well without ever suing anyone with

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,520
linux we didn't live in that particular

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,060
quantum reality

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,070
I didn't anyway maybe I've crossed like

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,330
Worf did in that episode and you all

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,310
remember a different history than I do I

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,600
don't know but as far as I know we

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:59,310
didn't I think in fact the GPL is a

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,990
reason that Linux was successful it's a

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,350
reason it was more successful than the

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:09,180
BSD s and it's enforcement was part of

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:12,500
that I think it's fun to say that we

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,090
don't need GPL enforcement because if

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,410
lawsuits and GPL enforcement endanger

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,530
Linux they've been endangering it since

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,190
2002 so if this is the world that

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,760
endangered Linux makes I think it's ok

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,500
not so bad

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,940
we have Linux and lots of lots of lots

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,810
of devices but meanwhile compliance is

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,090
more and more rare most devices on the

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,130
market are violating the GPL I used to

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,360
keep count I just have a giant email

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,150
folder of all the ones people have

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,140
emailed to the Conservancy I I couldn't

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,860
even count them anymore

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,510
I made a about because eight nine years

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,250
ago I made a bet with the world that I

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,920
could find a GPL violation for debt per

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,200
day for a year I did that of course it

00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:00,390
got boring after like day like 80 or 90

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,770
but I did it and what's even bigger now

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,860
is I'm talking a lot about Linux because

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,330
that's sort of where the the political

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,610
pressure and the political fight is

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,320
happening but it's not just about

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,690
busybox and limits there's Samba in

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,760
these devices there's ffmpeg and whole

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,190
bunches of other GPL software that

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,530
people put the GPL on because they

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,290
wanted software freedom for their users

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,910
and they're not getting it and it's not

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,070
just about Linux now we talk a lot about

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,520
Linux about the GPL I think for the

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,560
obvious reason because it's a kernel

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,390
which means the center of something so

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,580
it's the center of the operating system

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,800
so it's the kernel it's GPL so it's

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,790
obviously going to be the one that we

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,690
talked about first

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:46,630
and it's in all these devices and it's

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,680
violating and all those devices and

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,350
plenty more as well how about this kind

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,510
of my hero I told him recently that I

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,520
should have listened to him back in 2004

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,690
he was absolutely right

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,770
and it's unfortunate that he's gotten

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,500
busy with other things which are really

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,000
great projects but he's not available to

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,470
do enforcement the moment he wanted to

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,870
get started again but has not been able

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,900
to find the time so for the moment with

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,190
regard to Linux at least and Samba as

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,280
well Conservancy is the only

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,010
organization doing community oriented

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:24,010
enforcement what do I mean by community

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,090
or enforcement we have a list of

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,350
principles these are not first

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,210
principles these are sort of the

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,220
principles that fall out from the first

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,020
principle because if your goal is to get

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,540
software freedom for users there are

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,760
certain ways that you have to do GPL

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,590
enforcement to make sure that you're

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,500
doing it in a principled way that feeds

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,090
into that first principle now these are

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,220
principles that I followed for many many

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,290
years myself but I'd never written them

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,820
down so when Karen started working the

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,320
software freedom Conservancy she

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,590
suggested we actually write them down

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,420
and we actually codify them in a formal

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,400
way and make a public process to allow

00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,410
people to comment now people have not

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,450
joined our public process they sort of

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,830
are complaining off to the side and I

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,030
hope they will join and talk about our

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,170
principles but I think they're pretty

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,670
good and the one that is most pertinent

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,350
to the current political debate is this

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:15,400
one because we've always said that

00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,960
lawsuits are really bad if you have to

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,910
get to them and you should try to avoid

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,980
them and we've avoided and avoided and

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:25,210
avoided lawsuits in every case where

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:28,030
we've had to file one and because of

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,840
that the fact of the matter is Gregg and

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:34,390
I agree on almost everything about GPL

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,180
compliance and enforcement there's a

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:41,590
tiny tiny place where we don't agree

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:43,600
very very tiny and it's on I think a

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,900
relatively minor point and this is how

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,700
it goes I asked Greg if you have a GPL

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,910
Beiler's been violating for ten years

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,620
they're completely savvy they understand

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,180
completely what their violation is

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,010
in fact you've figured out that they

00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,570
planned from the start to violate the

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,850
GPL and try to get away with it and

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,550
they've told you to the face there's no

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,100
way they're ever gonna comply and just

00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,260
go away I asked her what should I do in

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:13,270
that situation you said you should walk

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:15,070
away so what that means is the worst of

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,440
the worst of wireless routers people who

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,850
actually try to make you know sneaky

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,040
little proprietary kernel modules that

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,170
do weird Network stuff are the ones who

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,059
will get away with violations and the

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,490
tablets that try to have proprietary

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,710
video and all sorts of other device

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,730
drivers and Linux that are not free will

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,170
get away with it because they're the

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,120
ones that are gonna stand firm and say

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:39,010
fine sue us and that TV when somebody

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,450
writes a DRM module for Linux and that's

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,740
to make a proprietary to the DRM

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,970
actually works they'll get away with it

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,100
cuz they're gonna say no you'll have to

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,580
sue us if you want us to liberate that

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,140
code so the worst in that strategy the

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,780
worst of the worst violators the ones

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,340
who really really planned to hurt the

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,510
free software community get away with it

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,630
and the ones who just made mistakes

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:03,790
actually come into compliance it seems a

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:06,520
little backwards to me now the fact of

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,440
the matter is it's companies who are

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,910
most upset that there have been lawsuits

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,830
about the GPL it's company

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,860
representatives hangar destabilizing our

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,600
industry they have destabilized their

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,400
industry pretty well already there are

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,809
hundreds of lawsuits everywhere but

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,059
every year between various tech

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,010
companies all the time there's this

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,510
service called pacer it's actually free

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,309
for your first 10 services if you want

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,260
to search the US legal system you can

00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:30,700
search for companies and see wow there's

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,800
all these lawsuits between them I never

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,660
heard about I tried to count earlier

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,429
today I went through every single

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,260
lawsuit I could think of and I counted

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,240
many of them twice like I counted our

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,860
one busybox lawsuit against fifteen

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,179
defendants is 15 it's like okay call

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,860
that 15 even though it was only one

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,929
because there was 15 defendants if you

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,590
count in the maximum possible way I

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:52,840
couldn't get past the mid-40s and that's

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,920
in the entire history of GPL enforcement

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,220
at least in the quantum reality I'm

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,140
living it so how is it that companies

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,640
can be so angry at us that we filed 50

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,170
lawsuit when they filed thousands

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,760
against each other

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,130
they continually a politically attack us

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,810
even companies that have countersued for

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,930
GPL themselves come back and attack us

00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,550
for violating the GPL and specifically

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,770
they're really really angry about

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,450
Christoph's case and in that case we're

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,100
funding Christoph to do what's right

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:24,320
about his code on code he holds

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,850
copyright on the funny part is is it's

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,550
not just that side that's angry that

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,170
being Karen for doing enforcement our

00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,880
friends are mad at it it's too because

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,270
of this one this principle they don't

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,970
like this year at renewal time for for

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,160
Conservancy supporters who joined last

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,940
year to donors wrote to us and they said

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,660
beside pretty much the same thing that

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,310
well you're just not being aggressive

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,540
enough you should be getting so much

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,760
money out of these companies that you're

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,990
funding a giant operation to enforce and

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,160
get everybody into compliance but

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,020
everybody has the source code they

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,550
deserve and you're just not doing it

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
right you should be making them pay

00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,580
through the nose so you can roll the

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,690
money forward and keep enforcing and

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:05,060
keep enforcing now we did a little bit

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,740
of that we got those defendants in that

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,630
busybox lawsuit into compliance and if

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,570
you go and read very very transparent

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,340
you can see exactly how much money

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,410
Conservancy took in from those lawsuits

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,390
and we did use some of that money to

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,070
fund future GPL enforcement but we've

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,490
been doing this Linux enforcement for

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,370
five years and I'm slightly ashamed to

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,470
say and all the Linux enforcement I've

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,900
done I have not gotten a single company

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,850
into compliance yet i we have matters

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,990
open that I opened the day we got the

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,600
first people signing up for our

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,610
coalition's those matters are still open

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,580
today Karen there's two emails you have

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,900
to send on those you know but yeah I

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,450
mean we're still working on those

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,900
matters Karen and I after five years and

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,580
the reason is proprietary kernel modules

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,930
they come into compliance on all the

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,970
easy stuff right they're like oh yeah

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,230
well we have a we fix our build system

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,770
and now you can build the software and

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,840
everything and we say that Cato file is

00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:01,580
a combined work with Linux you have to

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,990
give us a source code to that they say

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,160
well let's talk about all these other

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,420
issues we're fixing let's talk about

00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,070
those for a little longer we talk about

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,600
we dutifully say well we'll talk about

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,000
those let's get it we'll put that aside

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,800
we'll talk about that last finally we

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,500
get to that being the only

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:21,050
and they don't do it they don't come

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,790
into compliance now if we wanted to do

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,860
what our allies are asking us to be more

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,380
aggressive I don't think we can in that

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,970
scenario because of this principle this

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,270
principle is the most important one to

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,000
me I think it is complete corruption if

00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,430
you take a dime from a company who is

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,020
still out of compliance because

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,450
basically you're at that point being

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,430
paid off to look the other way so I will

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,590
not work for Conservancy I will resign

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:51,320
the day we take a dime from a company

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:52,910
that's in an active violation but that

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,190
also means I have to do this which I

00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,700
hate doing but if we're gonna go this

00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,770
way

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,410
and we're gonna say let's never be

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:04,510
corrupt let's never take money from

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:08,600
anybody who's in active violation then

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:09,830
we have to ask you to donate as was

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,480
mentioned in the last talk in this room

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,830
there is a supporter mat running if you

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,120
sign up as a sport for Conservancy of

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,250
the donation will be matched by an

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,590
anonymous donor for the next week so I

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:24,470
hope you will do it I also want to tell

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,310
you that we don't like this work it's

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,020
not like I'm enjoying it my political

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,120
opponents who have attacked me and

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,640
attacked Karen as well have kept saying

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,620
that somehow we you know we this is like

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,360
we're trying to make our careers out of

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,090
this you don't make your careers out of

00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,470
something that's boring in fact my at

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,640
least my career is screwed like I can

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,230
work two places for the rest of my life

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,610
that's all for freedom Conservancy or I

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,230
could go back and work for the FSF I

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,270
guess I could go be like we're gonna

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,780
coffee shop or something but that's it

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:56,750
because no one will hire me so why would

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,070
I do that to myself for any reason other

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,310
than because I care about this community

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,540
and I want to do good things for it

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,810
there's no other reason I wouldn't

00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,340
bother I'd love to be a developer again

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,710
I used to be a software developer it

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,240
used to be a sysadmin I guess I would be

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,360
antiquated because I don't say DevOps I

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,220
still say sysadmin but whatever I would

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,960
love to do that work again but this is

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,580
too important and there's so few people

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,020
doing it it's what Harold did Harold is

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,270
a software developer and he said

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,950
enforcement is pouring and annoying and

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,090
I care about it but I want to write new

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,549
free software for the woman's

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,169
some great new free software he's

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:31,610
written an entire GSM stack that's

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,710
completely free software it's really

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,539
amazing but he doesn't want to do GDP

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,270
enforcement so it leaves people like me

00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:41,659
and Karen to pick up the slack

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:44,720
I was asked in my pretty awesome

00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:46,730
interview which you can read online the

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,990
conference organizers this wasn't really

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,679
a question they just sort of stated it

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,029
but I took it as a question I answered

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,909
that it's absolutely I agree with this

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:58,100
completely I want every developer in

00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:59,390
this room to know I

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,850
I want to live in a world where you

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,890
would know if I put the GPL on my code

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,870
if I'm editing code that's under the GNU

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,090
general public license or any of the

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,990
similar licenses like the affero GPL or

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,909
l GPO that my software is forever free I

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,539
want that to be true but again I don't

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:19,520
live in that quantum reality copyleft is

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:20,960
not magic pixie dust we don't sprinkle

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,820
it on code and clap our hands and

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,059
suddenly it flies that's not how it

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,490
works it's difficult to keep copyleft

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,500
working there's a back-end process that

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,909
you have to do and we have someone has

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,909
to take care of that for Linux

00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:39,950
now I care a great deal about both GPL

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:42,230
and Linux so it's strange the care and I

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,159
have been accused of caring more about

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,260
one than the other

00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,399
a credits have said well you care about

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,799
more you care about copy oh if you don't

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,090
care what happens to Linux it's as if

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,809
they're saying we're gonna sacrifice

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:57,039
Linux for it the altar of the great GPL

00:30:53,809 --> 00:31:01,220
as if GPL where principle not a strategy

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,110
the thing is is Linux and GPL both are

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,970
not as important as people think they

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,590
are and I'm probably going to get that's

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,539
going to be the little sound bite that

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,059
my political opponents quote but it's

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,380
true and I will say the truth what

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:14,929
matters about Linux is it's a community

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,159
of people developing software it's a

00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,659
community that has some bugs that need

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,179
to be fixed that's much more important

00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,500
than anything else in some ways about

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,960
how they treat each other and so forth

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,640
on the mailing list but the key thing I

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,890
think is valuable about Linux is that

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,919
it's GPL then gets to the next

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,330
generation in these devices who pick it

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:33,559
up start hacking on it and then join

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,600
that community the community grows

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,010
that's the world that I wanted to live

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,389
and that's the world that excited me

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,589
when I got that laptop in 99

00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:44,219
- and that's the world I want to

00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:46,769
preserve really code and licenses both

00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:48,179
are ephemeral maybe I'm too much of an

00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,379
academically trained computer scientist

00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,389
but my professors always said the code

00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:54,389
doesn't matter the ideas behind it the

00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:56,009
ability to express computation is what

00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:57,690
matters and you rewrite code all the

00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:59,570
time Linux is being rewritten from the

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,239
ground up inside the Linux project

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:05,279
dozens of times over the years in the

00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:06,570
long term freedom matters long term

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,039
freedom matters more making sure that

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,809
everybody has the right to copy share

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,839
and modify the software that they have

00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:14,219
today matters more than what happened

00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,749
yesterday or what happens tomorrow and

00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:18,679
making sure that they can do it in

00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:22,889
perpetuity is what GPL is designed to do

00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,269
matters I want to make sure new

00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:27,149
developers can hack their devices that's

00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:28,259
the most important thing to me and I

00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,029
want them to be able to join the

00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,359
communities that don't require

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,099
proprietary software to join them that's

00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,349
the world I'm trying to create Linux is

00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,999
an excellent project to do that with the

00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:41,549
GPL is an excellent license to do that

00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,950
with but we can't mix up the principle

00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:45,659
with the specifics of success of one

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:51,329
particular project under one particular

00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:55,379
brand Conservancy is actually really

00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:57,119
just an agency for all of you we don't

00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,739
do anything unless developers ask us to

00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,389
do it that's true in our conference

00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:02,089
organizing work we don't organize random

00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:04,619
conferences we organize conferences that

00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:07,440
developers asked us to organize and it's

00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,269
true and our GPL enforcement work we do

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,129
it because developers came to us and

00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:15,299
said I would like you to enforce my

00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:17,549
copyrights for me so the future of GPL

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,979
the future of copyleft as a strategy

00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:23,609
does not really rests with Conservancy

00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:25,619
at all it rests with those of you that

00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:27,629
write GPL code those of you that

00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:29,419
generate copyrights assuming you're

00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,950
actually generating their own copyrights

00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:33,089
this is happening in pretty much every

00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,409
it's not just Linux it's happening

00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:37,619
pretty much every project except for

00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:39,929
Samba what some Bahasa policy that

00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:41,519
developers should be allowed to keep

00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,749
their own copyrights and it's preferred

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,579
for the developers to have their own

00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:45,899
copyrights and if you want to contribute

00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:47,339
to the project you have to get an

00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,649
agreement from your employer that you

00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,559
can do so most other projects don't work

00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:53,200
that way and

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,820
four time companies have moved to the

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,399
top and things like unknown and none

00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,779
which it's pretty mean to tell call

00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:01,330
independent developers it really should

00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,509
say independent developers there because

00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:07,440
that's who that probably is as is

00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:09,339
consultant and this unknown and so forth

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,790
everything else is companies there are

00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:15,069
company strong company up there whom

00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,649
when I met with a person in their

00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:19,089
open-source division told me you will

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:22,060
have to keep watching my company forever

00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:25,270
their plan is to violate every time

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,310
you're not looking and that company's on

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,649
that list so if we're in that world

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:32,079
if those kind of companies are holding

00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,849
the copyrights of Linux they can disarm

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,099
copyleft with a stroke of a pen

00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:40,419
eventually once they get all the

00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:42,280
copyrights everywhere so what's most

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:44,109
important for the future of copyleft is

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,260
for people to keep their own copyrights

00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:49,510
which is a position that key Linux

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,929
developers believe deeply in leanness

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,819
has always kept his own copyrights Greg

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,440
KH keeps his own copyrights James

00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:58,540
Bottomly posted to a mailing list

00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,460
recently saying that he has done as much

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,900
as he can as in career to make sure that

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,569
he and other developers can keep their

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,760
own copyrights I had a conversation with

00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,710
leanness and he told me actually I would

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,660
I know you used to work for the FSF and

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,980
you do that copyright asana I'm against

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,839
that stuff every developers have the

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,920
right to choose for himself or herself

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:21,420
well he just said himself what license

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,069
they get to put their software under and

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,720
how it's enforced and when it's enforced

00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:27,280
and who helps them with enforcement that

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,619
was stated to me by leanness as a

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,030
principle of his and I pretty much agree

00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:36,099
about that I think Karen and I both

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,780
agree about that and that's why we do

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:39,160
what we do because developers who do

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,750
hold their own copyrights have come to

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,450
us and asked us to be the who why and

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,109
when and where of their GPL enforcement

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,760
efforts and the nice part about that is

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:52,390
it's a very transparent regulatory

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,400
mechanism eventually if everybody's

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,349
angry at how we're doing enforcement we

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,750
will dismantle the project cuz everybody

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,910
will leave and if it grows because

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:04,410
people join it will grow

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,850
the interesting thing about all this is

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,470
out of these politics got worse we

00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,119
actually went to our coalition's and

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,410
said maybe this is too politically

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,860
enviable maybe you don't want to do this

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,230
anymore

00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,750
and they'd rather vehemently said no

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,760
please do not stop keep going keep going

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:22,410
this is important for me because that's

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,290
why I put GPL on my coat ironically

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:28,800
that's what's caused this battleground

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:32,369
and that battle ground was created by

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,869
the people that opposed the GPL I wish I

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:38,540
was good as a politician as they are

00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,540
some days I'm just too honest I think

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,910
we're only going to do what our projects

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,250
asked us to do and enforcement again I

00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:50,010
say is just one of the many things we do

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,450
to advance software freedom we worry

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,780
about logistics of projects we run

00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:57,300
conferences and pretty much anything

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,590
that comes along that we think is going

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,140
to impede software freedom if our

00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,570
projects are feeling strongly about it

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,070
we feel strongly about it too that's why

00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,660
Conservancy last week made this

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,859
statement this is actually just an

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:13,380
excerpt the full statements online I

00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:15,119
don't think we can stand silent in the

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,660
current climate as somebody from the

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,250
u.s. coming to Europe I felt an

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,619
obligation to put this on a slide and

00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,270
let you know that we are concerned as an

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,340
organization because these kinds of

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,220
larger global politics impact our

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,430
ability to share free software with each

00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,430
other

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,460
yeah it's weird living in the US I was

00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,530
born there I grew up there you know it's

00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,300
it's hard to leave your home so I really

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,369
didn't even consider leaving beside you

00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,380
don't want me to leave because that you

00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,970
know you can guess that I didn't vote

00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,470
for Trump so that's one less person

00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:05,500
there that's gonna vote for somebody

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:07,119
else so the politics of it are sir I

00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,070
think politics have a way of seeping

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,750
into everything and I think that the

00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,640
global politics the truthiness the

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,920
revisionist history it has seeped its

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,340
way in and I see this weird thing

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,170
happening Karen mostly but I as well and

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,550
some conferences have been running these

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,840
compliance feedback sessions where we

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,160
asked developers to come and tell us

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,230
what we're doing wrong we hear all this

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,190
vitriol about what we're doing

00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,600
constantly from company representative

00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,070
we figure well are the developers mad

00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,290
too they tell us the developers are mad

00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,970
we should ask them and the responses are

00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,200
basically almost overwhelming

00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,730
compositive they have these little tiny

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,900
tweaks like most developers they want to

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,800
come and sort of tweak the system be

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,910
like well if you did this slightly

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,040
differently wouldn't that work better

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,840
but other than that they're just giving

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,050
us positive feedback and saying we're

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,910
doing a good job and meanwhile we get

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,980
these constant criticisms coming at us

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,230
and all sorts of different it's kind of

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,060
sneaky political ways people do sneaky

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,520
political things to come after us all

00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,010
the time I don't know why they're doing

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:06,220
it I'm truly baffled

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:10,270
I'm truly baffled my best guess is that

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,410
they're actually afraid that you'll all

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,830
figure out that you're actually in

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,450
control I often say that if every single

00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,100
software developer woke up in the world

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,450
woke up tomorrow and said I will never

00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,310
write in line a proprietary software

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,710
code again the free software movement

00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,390
would win overnight now it's a silly

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,760
example because that's not going to

00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,520
happen but it goes to my point that each

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,760
developer individually has a linear

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,369
incremental influence on what happens to

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,540
software freedom so you're going to have

00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,540
to get your control back

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,619
the most important thing you can do is

00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:46,809
go to your employer and tell them you

00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,249
want to keep your own copyrights you

00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,349
should decide your licensing strategy I

00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:52,959
don't even care if you all go and do

00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:55,450
that and say I'm gonna use the IFC

00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:57,489
license I think developers should be in

00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,109
control of which free software license

00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:03,279
they pick not companies but if free

00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,499
software's going to succeed it's going

00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,229
to be dependent on developers being in

00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:10,059
control to policy not just code

00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:13,779
companies will trick you they've they

00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:15,789
understand what we do and they will give

00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:19,209
you lots of exciting technical problems

00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:20,469
to distract you from policy work on the

00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:23,440
technical problems but don't forget

00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:26,279
about the policy while you do it that's

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,279
all I have to say thank you

00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:46,969
I know the university needs us to leave

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,789
quickly do we have time for questions

00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:51,529
yes I think we have time for a few

00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:55,189
questions I'll pack up during questions

00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:57,109
so we got here so if brevity is a gift I

00:40:55,189 --> 00:41:00,169
know this is a topic where it's tempting

00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:02,149
to present your opinion but please try

00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:03,799
to focus on on the question so we can

00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:06,349
have lots of questions and if you leave

00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:10,119
the room please do so quietly so we have

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:12,739
two microphones and I will start here

00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,630
thank you for the door when you were

00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:16,069
discussing the business of not taking

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,439
money from companies to overlook

00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:21,049
violations which yay

00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:23,929
you then went straight to therefore I

00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:25,909
have to ask for contributions to the SFC

00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:28,159
which struck me as a bit of a false

00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:31,299
dichotomy it seems to overlook the

00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,299
question of costs Awards

00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:36,829
it seems to overlook the issue of costs

00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:38,959
awards could you discuss briefly whether

00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:41,929
you think those have any role to play in

00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:43,939
making violators pay for being sued oh I

00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:45,679
think that it's absolutely reasonable

00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:48,039
and we wrote the principles very very

00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,039
carefully

00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:02,770
so I think that we were very careful

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,359
interacting the principles to say that

00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,190
monetary gain shouldn't be a priority

00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:08,440
and you shouldn't take money from

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,480
somebody who's still violating but we do

00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,730
in our enforcement actions ask for them

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,530
to cover the costs of compliance that

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,849
they that they incurred and in the

00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,650
busybox loss stage you can go read our

00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:19,960
form 990 s and see that we received

00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,790
money from those violators because they

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,460
were fully in compliance the weird

00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:26,740
situation we have now is that and this

00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:29,050
is what I said in my LCA talk in 2016

00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,460
that everybody attacked me for but the

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,510
fact of the matter is is the only way

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,430
we're gonna get any of these Linux

00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,290
violators in the compliance is probably

00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,640
to sue them because they keep saying we

00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,410
will not release the source code to that

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,890
proprietary module for years and years

00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,569
and years

00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,069
which is exactly what VMware did which

00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:44,400
is exactly why Christophe had to sue

00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:46,630
them and that case is still pending I

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,819
hope that the German system would be

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,920
faster than the US it's turning out that

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:52,720
it kind of isn't it's taking just as

00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,310
long as US cases tend to take so we have

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,920
to wait for the courts to deal with it

00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:00,359
and while that's happening we have to

00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:06,520
keep funding it and I hope you'll donate

00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:08,650
it's up here the next question yeah hi

00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,480
my name is Peterson Achuthan and I am a

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,680
Kano developer and what you do in

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,660
situation is in which you have a

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,369
developer that simply completely

00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,109
disagree with you I don't feel that you

00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:19,089
represent my interests as I cannot

00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:21,310
develop what what you do in situations

00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:25,270
like that and I consider myself a

00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:26,560
community guide so it's I what you do in

00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,720
situations like that I'm not I'm not

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,920
defending that companies are good or

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,160
anything from the community perspective

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,079
you simply don't represent me so what's

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,910
your take on that is that you're saying

00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,349
you don't feel Conservancy represent

00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:42,700
your views yeah so you shouldn't sign

00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,500
one of our enforcement agreements they

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,210
are public online you can read them you

00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
should tell people why you don't agree

00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,880
with you should tell us why you don't

00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,940
agree with this and maybe we should

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,380
change our behavior so that you could I

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,880
think the most important thing is that

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,109
you are in control as a developer

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,089
whether you agree with me or not

00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:59,109
right and suppose you're like a BSD

00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:00,579
developer which means you probably

00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:02,380
disagree with me about a lot of things I

00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:03,010
think if your BSD developer you should

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,930
have your own

00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,980
rights to and license them under the BSD

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,650
license because that's what you believe

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,050
in that's what I think is most important

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,060
in all this and that's important as a

00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,760
meta strategy right I talked about how

00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:18,910
copyleft is just a strategy well it's

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,950
important that we try all the strategy

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,450
at once including licensing things under

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,060
non copyleft license isn't a whole host

00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,310
of other things but I really put my face

00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,040
and develop with basement faith in

00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,630
developers developers are the people

00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,700
that created this community and they

00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,530
understand it and they care about what

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,570
happens to their software for their

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,550
users so I want you in charge of that

00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:47,220
decision-making process not some

00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:52,090
corporate lawyer over here I've got it

00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,070
so I'm one of those people who thinks

00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,390
you should be more aggressive I heard

00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:59,470
you donated anyway thank you

00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:03,430
yeah so you say on your slides you know

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:05,800
the GPL to projects you know violators

00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:09,040
should get the benefit of GPL v3 like

00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,870
termination clauses um personally I

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,580
wouldn't even go that far I think they

00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,200
should be encouraged to switch to GPL 3

00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,290
because the GPL two's termination

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,240
clauses are terrifying but if you don't

00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,280
want to go that far you could give them

00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,530
the benefit of something very like the

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,320
GPL 3 termination clauses come into

00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,450
compliance within 60 days otherwise well

00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,210
in that case when you have come into

00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,930
compliance we will need a fat wad of

00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:37,420
cash as well to restore your rights and

00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,920
I think that's roughly what happened

00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,460
with the busybox lawsuits that

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,980
conservancy did I wouldn't say we asked

00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,560
for a quote fat wad of cash at quota as

00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,380
you put it I think we asked for our cost

00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,480
to be covered reasonably and and making

00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,130
sure that we had a sustainable model I

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,350
believed at that time we could make a

00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,390
sustainable model but I didn't I I

00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,770
basically underestimated when I was

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,490
doing this before Karen work with us

00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:06,340
that that these Linux violators would be

00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:09,670
so strident and ready to basically go to

00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,200
court I'm amazed to this day that VMware

00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,390
just didn't remove the Linux code

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,340
they're trying to do it now for the new

00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,720
products but not the old ones but they

00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,310
could rewrite their current

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,740
such that they took all Linux credit out

00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:23,830
it is possible to comply with the GPL

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,140
just by not incorporating the code that

00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,400
sheep yelled anymore they don't have to

00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,440
release vmkernel

00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,260
they can remove the GPL to stuff from

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,390
vmkernel why they didn't do that for the

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,920
years that people were complaining to

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,480
them that they had violated I don't know

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,530
I don't I truly don't understand it it's

00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,810
bizarre to me I and and so because of

00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,700
that situation it means that there's not

00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,080
revenue coming in because I'm not gonna

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,090
take a dime from any of those companies

00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:52,599
I'll stop and I don't think Karin would

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:57,010
agree to that either right so up here

00:46:52,599 --> 00:47:00,220
very up here yep so I was wondering if

00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:04,540
you are able to attract people who are

00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:09,160
who don't have a software background but

00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:14,369
have a legal background so you can sort

00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:21,640
of bring people into the Conservatives

00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:26,589
conservancy yeah yeah so are you able to

00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,060
bring in fresh blood with more of a

00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:30,310
legal background than a software

00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,690
background half of our staff have we

00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,550
have a staff of four and half of them

00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,230
have law degrees so I think we've been

00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,710
successful in that Karen and Karen is

00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,089
one of them but yeah there aren't many

00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,010
lawyers who will work for a non-profit

00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:44,349
wages though a lot of people go to law

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:47,260
school to get rich that's a fact of fact

00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:48,430
of life and so cuz you that's another

00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,050
thing you'd see on a farm damage you can

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,640
see how much we get paid as well you

00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:55,330
will notice that we do not get paid as

00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,480
much as law firm lawyers by far we're

00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,480
we're

00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:12,890
Sarek does the software freedom

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,690
Conservancy maintain a list of active

00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:18,619
violations and companies that violate

00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:20,539
the GPL so that consumers can look at it

00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:23,059
and say I don't want to buy products

00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:25,520
from those fenders anymore so that's

00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:27,410
very similar to what Eric Anderson once

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,980
maintained called the Hall of Shame for

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,750
busybox

00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,940
one of our principles you might have

00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,710
noticed is this idea of maintaining

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,470
confidentiality now that particular

00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:39,079
principle has been criticized I think

00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,420
that that principle is important because

00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,130
it is still true that while the most

00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,140
strident violators are these ones with

00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,990
these proprietary Linux modules the

00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,089
overwhelming majority of violators often

00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,039
have no clue that GPL software's in

00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:53,960
their product so going and publicly

00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,700
shaming them doesn't seem right to me I

00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,130
would rather work with them to get in

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,049
compliance and so we have looked at the

00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,940
idea of trying to get community members

00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:03,079
involved to help those types of

00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,180
companies that are likely to be

00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,400
responsive to engineers but there are

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,230
very few people that can do that and it

00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,980
also has a public shaming expect if we

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:14,569
run that as a individual project okay

00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,359
they want to give me the next question

00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:19,760
sorry yeah it will be the last questions

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:22,010
I think you will talk to you later to

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,359
hallway talks if yeah you can be found

00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:27,470
tomorrow so your last question yeah

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:32,240
thank you so this is a question about

00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:35,869
paragraph 2 of the GPL b2 if if I were

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:39,319
to distribute a subsection please the

00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:41,180
final paragraph the final paragraphs the

00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:46,250
three final paragraphs out you mean the

00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:49,339
penultimate that it is so if I were to

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,910
distribute a phone with a GPL 2 app and

00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:53,210
userspace

00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:58,210
is that phone a whole work or is that

00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:02,210
phone a volume storage medium so the GPL

00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,069
doesn't decide that in a sense that is a

00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,289
question of the copyright regime you're

00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:08,240
operating under never forget that GPL is

00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:09,890
a copyright license which means it

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,390
operates under the copyright law in the

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,720
jurisdiction you're in

00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:17,300
when you go to act about it and that was

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,349
by design it's what is called Stallman

00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,520
called strong copyleft so the goal was I

00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,780
Jeremy or Michael Meeks invented this

00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,180
phrase I'm not sure which

00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:29,359
it's the judo move of copyleft it takes

00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:32,210
the force of copyright and says I'm

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,760
gonna push back with maximum force using

00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,830
that force against itself and so it's

00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,020
trying to get as far as copyright law

00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,940
goes and as copyright law expands ie

00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,880
declares more things derivative works

00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:46,010
then of course GPL will cover those

00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,140
things as combined or derivative work so

00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,080
it works or as gplv2 puts it works based

00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:53,060
on the program so I can't answer that

00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,950
question every buddy always asks it and

00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,599
that's the the phrase that makes people

00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,520
angry it makes corporate lawyers angry

00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:00,050
because they're their anger as well you

00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,060
won't tell us what we're allowed to make

00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,200
proprietary well you were gonna wait for

00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,589
the court to do that creates uncertainty

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,680
etc etc that was how it was designed in

00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:12,830
1988 that was the plan from the start

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,450
and my glib answer is always if you're

00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:17,750
not sure make everything you do free

00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:20,210
software or don't put any GPL software

00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,770
in it you can always do that that's the

00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,560
classic place where I clash with a lot

00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,119
of people because I still believe what

00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,250
Stallman said about this which was if

00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,160
you want your software to be maximally

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,020
popular use a non copyleft license if

00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,089
you wanted to maximally defend freedom

00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,160
use the strongest copyleft license

00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,780
available so it's a trade-off right I

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,430
know people are going to be afraid from

00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,619
that issue you raise and say oh my gosh

00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,150
I can't do this and I know it's painful

00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:46,010
if you work in a company where you're

00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,020
trying to get free software adopted but

00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,820
remember the GPL was designed to defend

00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,980
your freedom and the conversation you're

00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,080
actually having is how much freedom can

00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,040
we take away please tell us and you say

00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,720
you're not allowed to take away any

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,880
freedom but can't we take a little bit

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,349
of freedom well you'll have to ask a

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,430
lawyer why should we have to ask a

00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:02,869
lawyer how much freedom we should take

00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:05,920
away you should tell us how much we can

00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:09,010
oppress you don't fall into that trap

00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,010
[Applause]

00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:23,300
I'm happy to take more questions you'll

00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:25,400
find me tomorrow either in the

00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,410
Conservancy booth in H or across the

00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,980
hall in the legal and policy dev room

00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,980
