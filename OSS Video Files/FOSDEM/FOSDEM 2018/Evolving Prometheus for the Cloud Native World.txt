	00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,660
that's where it happened I haven't the

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,670
list yeah and so my name is Brent grovel

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,410
and I live spoke about a balton

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,380
prometheus forward it's now made of room

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,380
so if you don't already know me I'm one

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,239
of your main developers reaches by

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,710
something the Trinity of Google for a

00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,439
while and contributed to many

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,810
open-source projects and also be found

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,610
under most perception bridge stuff is

00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,239
trying to do something sporting for

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,400
breaches but enough about me why are we

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,740
actually going to talk about today right

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,430
so firstly I'd like to talk about how we

00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,630
got where we are in terms of poetry and

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,480
actually like to talk a little about

00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,120
three days party I know things about and

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,630
then looking at how previous has changed

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,420
over time

00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,420
speech that made environment has evolved

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,110
and so if you look at a lot of

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,360
monitoring and what's going on a lot of

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,119
attitudes to mother frankly have today a

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,499
lot of is based on tools techniques from

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,569
like the 90s and 2007 awesome at the

00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:21,630
time like I remember my first engakuji

00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,609
gap in your working after like an hour -

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,829
that was like this is listening units

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,770
usually network usage it's amazing and

00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,600
it was and we're also the situation as

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,090
well where we have not that many

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,789
machines and not that many services and

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,770
they were lovingly cared for by citizens

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:40,889
do you know treated them kind of like

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,579
their own their own children and we call

00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:46,859
pets these things special cases and

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,450
we're going once every service was

00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,520
special every service of the special

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,520
case being special of caring attention

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,520
and they have tools like Nigel's

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,619
thank you in this world were machine

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,349
their pets and the services they promote

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,349
machine we have the my sequel machine

00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:11,370
the apache machine the male machine

00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,870
right one machine one purpose and for

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,660
situation where if any one of those

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,640
machines deviated somehow humans would

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,080
jump off right and fixes an

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,820
investigation and we're going to make

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,720
sure it's absolutely perfect

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,660
that's lovely care and but this also

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,970
means that all this parallelism and this

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,550
great attention to detail was basically

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,170
also loaded branch because they're

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,910
jumping at all these things with not

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,160
much actually practical effect that's

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,070
basically feeling the system's we've

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,040
tracked human blood not listening

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:48,510
usually yeah ramble can be very strong

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,790
and but you know perhaps I want to avoid

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,110
and I was willing to the Canadian

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:59,040
environment we need kind of a new

00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:01,800
perspective and so what's kind of

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,410
different these days so well it's no

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,300
longer the case that we have one service

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,070
on one machine and that machine the

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,560
service is going to be there of the Liu

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,360
Shan finally dies often interfaced every

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,220
several times

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,680
instead we're in the world with systems

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,500
like docker and kubernetes for services

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,660
are being emphasized machines and those

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,610
we moved around on an hourly basis due

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,660
to all this dating or releases or

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,660
anything like that

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,830
we're also living active situation where

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,570
we're going from

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,660
motherland's you know Mike minima

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,490
handful of outlets to might have tens or

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,370
freedom of the hundreds of micro

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,900
services and this means that not just do

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,110
we have these more dynamic services

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,640
we've got far more of them so the old

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,800
war was over this is a much more dynamic

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,840
system or teams are journeying moving

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,860
around a lot more and is much much more

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,400
monitor that's kind of different and

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,790
more difficult so we've got this setting

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,530
so let's talk about Prometheus's so the

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,200
radius is a metric space monitoring

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,319
system yeah they're answering every

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,980
satisfactory was

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,389
this but it is for this event and

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,980
there's a lot of people they are talking

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,139
some of the previous talks you saw I'm

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,709
talking about tracing from logging and

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:17,019
so on

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,489
after all this will techniques important

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,079
and complementary techniques you need

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,270
all of them but important in our

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,360
previous is it doesn't care about every

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,949
single request that comes in right if

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,840
you were 100 requests in last-minute

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,599
Carini's are not going to remember every

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,310
single words but in insolence remember

00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,919
statistics are kind of aggregated across

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,620
time formats so it's going to ever hate

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,599
there were a hundred requests in total

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,120
they took two seconds

00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,250
and forth and hit the cache for you to

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,440
print out your code path and one of the

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,870
results of nerve so how has that overall

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,560
view but all different subsystems they

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,570
look how long they took my use vintage

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,759
as well Lucas has a time series data

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,259
base at its core a time series that

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,919
makes just means a database that has

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,020
time as the dimension so this does you

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,050
know describe twice of all different

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,669
systems with very different I distance

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,050
but you know three these implement those

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:16,630
as well the radius also has a pretty

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,580
powerful data model and so produced the

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,440
graphic you have like the don't strain

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,509
things for you not to know the position

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,340
of polka dots they played out Center

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,820
that's the name of an application that's

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,650
named by region and that's pepper draw a

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,509
great is instead its key value pairs

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,060
with arbitary existance

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,620
no one cares short order so you can day

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,810
and aggravate my goals like anything you

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,490
watch go an aggregate by developments

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,220
your path if you wanted to know either

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,690
gauge by Europe you can if you want

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,550
either make my actually I don't care

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,080
about any of the vicious so we have the

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,419
same body array because I can smooth

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,550
weird soil off that by it you can do all

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,710
that and never how many laying about

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,250
previous is the bodies among integers

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,380
there tons now this is not different hey

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,310
I've got a 64 with double versus the

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,849
64-bit integer what's the difference and

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,250
the difference is take about links if

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,840
you actually make a mistress quite

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,039
usually going to use are you going to do

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,569
seconds milliseconds microseconds

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,089
nanoseconds

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,379
and it turns out that people choose all

00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:23,309
of these depending on the personal

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,709
topics and ten never put the met the

00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:30,389
human name in the metric name so all I

00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:32,369
have is latency okay looks like

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,229
milliseconds hope seconds the verb real

00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:38,909
some of it is and and in case of water

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,639
visit here a quote at one point three

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,080
distances of all four of those units on

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,610
the same suspects yeah we're not the two

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,180
now we won't believe on like a sense of

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,499
seconds and so instead previously just

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,020
say the conical floating point numbers

00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:54,330
it doesn't matter because you know we

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,860
taking care of my boy just have every

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,860
second it's not probably kind of goes

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,990
away as well you do all the math you

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,779
walk that all those values signify an

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,259
aggregation even join two different time

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,219
series together and these stuffs can

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,319
take quantiles

00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,849
and you can do predictions using mirror

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,830
connections because when it comes to my

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,399
heart this is filling up spanning

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,080
specials

00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,449
I don't percentage or rien just be

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,029
device don't work however linear

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,729
regression is better it's not perfect

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,830
but it's better and the poor contain as

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,050
well is that you can use all these and

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,759
rats but anything you can breath you can

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,369
immerse on there is no division between

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,969
Ralphie and we're just kind of happening

00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:37,889
and in fact these are the Wi-Fi metrics

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:41,879
for Boston which has been using previous

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,289
now for traders to know and just knocked

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,579
off from earlier because of course mean

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,180
why play it's not working here in

00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:52,169
aspects but it's all actually has the

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,240
benefit and for that we have increases

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,449
we support session okay because I want

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,019
small to my home switch that's really

00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,189
exciting

00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:06,959
but hey pretty girl I have some other

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:08,039
aspect of ladies is - reliability and if

00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,199
you look a lot of sisters in there

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,229
they're like clustered or complicated

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,909
very difficult capacitive watch the

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,709
radius the Corbitt is a single binary

00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,259
single go by very succulent

00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:22,169
any speeding servers independent all

00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,510
means is local SSD you can also do an

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:29,210
artist

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:31,490
and let's say people ask you if it's a

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,780
single server what happens you know when

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,290
they kind of talk there something else

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,850
for a while

00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:38,120
isn't the point today now the answer is

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:40,669
yes there will be a gap I happens

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,590
dealing now this might seem at the cost

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,729
but turns out this is one of those

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,130
things as well that's actually very

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,960
difficult to get much so let's say that

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,790
I'm a previous or your service got

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,740
overloaded and one and that's the reason

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,300
why we span is great you know you can

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,360
close with that I'd like to say

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,090
everything you know the salsa moves from

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,980
the camel's back and you know we started

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,320
metrics again that's like right let's

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,090
back it so suddenly they're going to

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,890
double the load at least getting all

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,030
that pulled out and back in and we're

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,880
going to take out all in the services

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,980
again so you just caused the outage that

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,810
you know they're trying to stop so

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,730
backfilling is not this means we're very

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,990
cautious because a proposed have

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,060
physically additional three some load

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,720
the services potentially just about

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,840
overload

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,250
so a simpler approach is you know the

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,080
lengths are gonna happen anyway because

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,570
the network weirdness and you know you

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,720
just exceed human is wrong if what

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,390
happens every few hours two years and we

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,050
just buildings to more reliable but this

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,000
failure happens failure is normal and of

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,980
course the company case is based on a

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,650
single machine apparently there's a

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,150
space of a single machine and so for a

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,730
longer term storage if you do want for

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,620
some clustered storage system so nothing

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,420
involved well remote storage which can

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,420
send it out I have to clear it back in

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,360
this is not right

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,190
and so they come up to more cloudy

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,930
balance right so we have thematic

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,730
environments where it's not the case

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,280
that ordering a new machine takes six

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,140
months and the whole stop paper but

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,330
instead that they can just appear as if

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,970
by magic because they're sufficiently

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,680
advanced technology and you know you

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,870
need to be able to technical matter you

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,650
can't rely on with human pushing out and

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,330
floor check the water so we discuss

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,030
plainclothes services company which we

00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,610
talk to kubernetes the reason to or GCE

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,100
or console and just damn old machines

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,110
continues to develop it so allister's

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,330
mean occupational apps as all the

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,070
standing as even new applications are

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,650
added it can also have a pick those up

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,720
the structure crumble if you can finish

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,450
and even better

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,070
my 3ds the pull based system and that we

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,740
use that because of our list of you know

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,890
easy to of usual instances that exist if

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,960
we you know don't have information in

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,180
turn is rape us and it fails you know o

00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,440
in standard but the bush based system

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,350
room babies tell the difference between

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,270
a system that is download and never talk

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,670
to us and the system that simply doesn't

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,520
exist so it's kind of handy you will

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,620
find that if you do have like one log

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,350
systems that are telling you how I exist

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,940
after all cross goes up with instances

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,740
that are there then I told this when you

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,750
more but you're still paying for so you

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,860
all doing stuff for reconciliation to

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:27,070
connect tones that's gonna be another

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,340
thing keep in mind and share is hexes a

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,730
Navy the OPM will pronounce and spell

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,860
that correctly and so only if you have

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,870
services on like my friend machines the

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,330
chances are the machines are identical

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,250
like reasonably identical but if you

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,870
suddenly have you know tens of

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,550
microservices with tens of replicas

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,310
spread across like 100 machines

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:51,820
those aren't so whole genius anymore

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,770
because sure it's sustaining since

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,660
neither you want an Amazon or from

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,850
Google or Microsoft but actually they

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,890
have the big news with very fantastic

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,080
are a very even higher voice

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,930
characteristics

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,760
and as level stylized Wells's sharing

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,230
that virtual machine which you might be

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,080
losing your hash lights or something

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:14,160
like that that's going to you know make

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,779
some of your instances slow and if

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,250
you've got you know all these instances

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,959
spread around the places for your

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,450
service I saved a hundred replicas your

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,980
service and the fuel is slow because we

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,240
alerts when you individual instance

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,190
being slow because that's going to

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
happen all the time and that's not a

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,269
good use of your time

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,410
because it's gonna be paged continuously

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,019
access them that you know wake up Manila

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,149
life's like Oh danke but it doesn't

00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,040
matter really because it's not that can

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,630
be any user that's probably saying is

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,980
red cloak there you know we should be

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,630
looking at my facts again using your

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,089
escalates so you don't care about

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,399
individual instance being slow we care

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,560
about is overall user experience across

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,019
all instances is it all right

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,140
is the overall latency okay is the

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,120
overall error rate okay and prompt well

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,890
that is that aggregated cross-match so

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,870
it's better to know this one's a bit

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,820
slow and linking up with obviously

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,459
actually the whole services with an SLA

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,260
or ok the docking instance we can do it

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:12,240
in the morning you know after you've had

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:14,520
30 staff coffee in the morning and this

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,240
brings it forward down the point that

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,670
for impairments now which are far more

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,370
complicated than any one human mind

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,170
Hannah Hannah

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,510
the Fargo moving particle is left

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,740
overlays they've got the kernel is

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,329
getting more more complicated the

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,880
application more publish but all these

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:35,640
Midlands there's so many moving parts

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,589
and it cleans you so much over time that

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,779
others and everything that might pose a

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:43,140
problem is just not tracking you can't

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,610
do it Cynthia taxi even trying to

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,170
enumerate in this copernica

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,660
you know the kind of rock thought it

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,850
work so instead you do meet the set of

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,010
things that could cause a thorough look

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,779
at your symptoms look at what your users

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,329
needs which is maybe see a narration or

00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,130
whatever get them disaster assistance

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,260
and then I should call show quite nicely

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,510
you can drill down to your service based

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,670
on your race your agency for their holds

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,220
this service here and I mean in some

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,810
systems this is what the common is then

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,770
you pull up your tracing the kolenda

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,770
profile you create a loss

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,339
so that's that all of you some things

00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:20,680
Greece is doing I kind of do to help you

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:24,250
to deal with the Taliban for holes

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:29,170
behind this ISM it's sure but previous

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,819
was always you know this good out and it

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,740
started off pretty basically like well

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,990
the four years ago that it had very

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,269
intimate wing service discovery problem

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,399
Kalyn was not gonna win today the mind

00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,519
actually over these years things have

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,160
evolved to zero for example which came

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,569
out there a few months ago and

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,220
improvements in two major areas do they

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,769
won this new time series database just

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,420
borrow our mission and also new

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:55,000
stainless my links I worked on which

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,430
better sports instance is going away and

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,560
because well in an old stock environment

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,680
machines KOCO Elena

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,509
you know maybe whatever you want we're

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,490
in Ezekiel walk off that happen if you

00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,410
don't finish so we need a little more

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,069
careful and the artifacts that holes are

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:14,980
actually the problem so virtually one of

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,689
three is from v1 storage so at the start

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,730
this life previous like the first two

00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:21,759
years or so if it was in another we need

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,620
all the actual time series data and all

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,839
the master bath so the magnet after I

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,130
mean the Maples the ultimate intentional

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,139
key value pairs and then finding the

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,930
series because we need to like Amex them

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:34,839
to say hey give me all no exporter

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,009
sayings more CPU and then we need to

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,410
find all those metrics of both events

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,810
there's a two-step phase little Korean X

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,410
then clear back all that for now feeding

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,670
it radius with shutdown or kills you

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,880
know we're going to lose 15 minutes

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,130
about potentially in terms of reforms it

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,769
top dives and around 50,000 samples per

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,139
second which was still shall we say

00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,110
compress them within the space at that

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,819
time you know that not quite myself is

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,769
this a new context if you had why other

00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,000
machines they were scraping every twenty

00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,490
seconds for the temperament to teach

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,160
that could be a match so that works

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:13,329
pretty nicely and even on like a

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,220
reasonably large system my grass is the

00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:18,160
quality you're trying to use my sequel

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,250
for basics and these not this sort of

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,410
volume because problem you have is if I

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,750
play data from the machine

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,399
the senator I'm getting like a Towson

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,310
metrics at this time with different

00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,110
names well what I want to do a read

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,720
I don't want those Towson ones that I

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,819
have for the scrape to our stream what I

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,600
want is this would metric known as part

00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:42,790
of a hundred straight across tell you so

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,060
we must situation or everything

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,160
admiration is the most recent value work

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,410
or is the reading kind of her result oh

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,389
so you might end up having to do is

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,189
multiply at the data so it's official to

00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,829
read and all the given matrix is

00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:58,120
together on this so that means you

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,000
basically need to buffer up your rights

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,949
a lot and basically right in time series

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,990
data base for these metrics basically

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:08,890
transcending to having lots and lots of

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,589
light buffering and that brings us to

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,559
version two is storage entity which is

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:17,770
also increased more than four - so this

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,089
was part of previous zero nine and which

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,260
we launched just about three years ago

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:25,179
and if you're burning and it moved the

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,829
time series data to evolve the time

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,830
series which means thought that that is

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,000
all going to be together on this and

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,100
then the rights are spread over six

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,320
hours broader than we've lost reading 15

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
minutes or so there's also 10,000

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,190
compression so we went down from

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,860
Tennessee like 16 mics per sample down

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,059
to two point three bytes which happen

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,429
cousin you know principle you have eight

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,409
bytes with NASA eight bytes for self so

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,330
it points that I've been major exact

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:53,919
points in memory stage so lose 150

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,390
minutes a bath no longer gone and over

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,370
time as well because we have this

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,710
database for a few years and not

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,480
learning the truth we added some

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,090
extremely basic threw sticks in the

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,890
indexing and Facebook these produced the

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,870
gorilla paper we need background over

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,130
the progression so we adopted - when we

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,590
got like four point three mics per

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,200
sample just pretty good and go some

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,400
memory optimization to result so like

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,320
get out of here without here yeah I was

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,850
trying to be benchmark so previously was

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,820
something this is how much CPU and how

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,740
much RAM you need and you spent on the

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,149
Spanish instead of copies or seizures by

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,859
30% so you know you win some

00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:34,409
but those are things like the most

00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,299
savings and I felt that one I think

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:38,519
you're they made it easier to configure

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,679
memory usage because anything corporate

00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,799
databases you know how this might define

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,569
for ten or twenty novelty - and it's

00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,299
funny gasps how much memory this might

00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:51,179
be reading it's not like by you this

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,349
poor thing and go away that's we just

00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,119
said here's the most ground I want to

00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,409
use the people I think would just adjust

00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,479
things and the big things to make a

00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,949
happen which most work from the main

00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:04,379
administration far easier it's all good

00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:06,569
so the outcome of Egypt and it was the

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:08,689
Fargo reformed so the lead one storage

00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:11,519
engine with a 50,000 samples per second

00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:14,699
the me chase or attention you record a

00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,309
congestion is about 800,000 sample per

00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:21,899
second so that's a nice little boost

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:24,299
sales have 16x world performance yes 14x

00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:26,279
that wasn't perfect but those we won we

00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,309
didn't stop there it's not working the

00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,649
display this healthy and because well it

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:35,489
takes 40 50 minutes to check the data

00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:37,409
and previously in v1 it was changing you

00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:39,689
know 15 minutes so this is even more

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,399
data loss potential II know this is all

00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:42,989
falling back to her after fifty thousand

00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,699
sounds per second where in your

00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:46,709
checkpoint was still taking 30 seconds

00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,619
but I forget to larger and larger and

00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:51,809
larger and advocated for problem and

00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,579
sure which is to say new tiny series new

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,889
targets new machines appearing and

00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,559
disappearing that affects bmxing so the

00:19:55,889 --> 00:20:00,689
indexing is impractical embers of

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:04,619
somewhere around 10 million tiny series

00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:06,659
within anomalous and some people here

00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,269
that five million large be pushed it's

00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:10,559
20 30 40 but you know though you're

00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,959
going to run of problems somewhere

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,879
around 10 billion mark and that's a

00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:16,709
 tire retention period so if

00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,299
you've got a previous the two sets and

00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,519
you know keep that up for three months I

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,179
in Turkey unfairly instances to reduce

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,499
and so on even burns without pretty fast

00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,539
and well we've got the fall for time

00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:29,219
series so the ones bleak the oldest

00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,559
meant to change you for me right in our

00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:32,480
body because only X the best supports

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,100
one

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,230
from Beijing the files and when we have

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,299
those in dentists so that's a 10x

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,040
magnification factor and it is though

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:44,030
Prometheus this version where they

00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,570
killed SSDs on several occasions yeah

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,970
yeah that's like johannes fish first

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,490
prize in the Raspberry Pi until the SSD

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,960
welcome to surprise here oh my gosh but

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,230
also more production stuff is also

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,450
significant application thoughtfulness

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,610
as well level TB is using Co

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,169
implementation and we did get to the

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,210
point in from you disk where we start to

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,540
discover issues like bosses who loves

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,620
kernel bugs back hardware so we are

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,799
likely should where we're starting to

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,330
see weird stuff and we're seeing

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,790
corruption and crashes which we tinker

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,290
inside them to be and but we've not

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,260
really bumped up with the state C code

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,600
we kind of we the Bugaboo go that's not

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,780
perfect so where can we go from here

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,690
because well something that I really

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,400
will be dealing with Kleiser that's more

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,780
efficient than all is Lately next things

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,330
we don't have these ten million image

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,370
and avoid right application it all

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,169
speaking the dice be able to take

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,780
backups and some users want to do that

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:43,280
because it's like if you really expense

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,960
read asleep leaving 20 minutes to do a

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,179
checkpoint that means an acquaintance

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,540
shutdown time then you think the snaps

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:53,120
off pain trainer comedians back off you

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,070
know rank 30 taking your three days out

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,990
for 20 minutes is probably not that you

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,390
want to be doing for backups like you

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,330
can tolerate five minutes once a week or

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:06,559
once a month and but you know 20 minutes

00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:08,090
a day not elect you to coach so this

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,549
brings us the version three stories

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,880
which in 3ds 2.0 and it's written by

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,740
Duggan and principally is that the

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,870
state's been two blocks which are two

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,700
hours long initially the bill book locks

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,860
memory and you ranking them every two

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,500
hours those office compaction later all

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,660
together they're using virtually nexus

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,730
with posting this so nice one of the

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,770
ropes and everything is accessed by

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,120
in math so radius recreate this is

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,340
already doing its own memory management

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,440
now we just set the curl to clear an

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,030
occupation so now the situation the

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,410
previous just uses as much where we have

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,510
needs so there's no longer any

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,940
configuration at work and is also

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,190
writing it log for crafts restarts so a

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,600
restocking all within the workspace take

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,010
that finish this pretty scene so the

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,280
outcome is like we're still not rainy

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,660
days - the start taking loans which and

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,330
millions of Snapple suggests per second

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,420
is certainly possible and if you look at

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,740
other similar systems not dispensaries

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,440
on bases motor databases

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,170
I see how much performance they can get

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,300
to a single machine the numbers top out

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,940
somewhere a million to four million

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,530
sounds a second ranking so it does seem

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,360
that we're getting pretty close to the

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,400
theoretical maximum of what she max we

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,070
got out of a single machine it's nice to

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,950
them and the reports also improve quite

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,290
Loft is feverfew nexus those something's

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,780
has done elevation and memory CPU usage

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,090
without man factor three due to heavy

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,280
micro optimization it's been optimized

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,710
the health of that base of it and this

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,540
price because we're going to rank all

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,120
these files look basically officer down

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,980
by a factor of a hundred which they're

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,570
not people thanks for it's good so

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,900
that's just look better off previous at

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,290
least 2.0 now has because it is based on

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,060
years of monitoring experience and the

00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,550
new plank series database is far more

00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,080
able than the previous systems deal with

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,590
he's been caught in the net requirements

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,970
so please Hasbro the season is broke the

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,920
service discovery at don't want to

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,750
monitor Cromwell allows American on the

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,000
team's actually character rather than

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,070
obtains a panic alert from jail after

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,350
our PCB usage in highly non-spherical

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,330
latency is highly problems were actually

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,860
scared of that

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,110
this means that really is a pretty good

00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,420
choice for the campaign of metrics model

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,700
drink because it has developed thousands

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,890
of companies using there are hundreds of

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,780
exporters there's like both of fifteen

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,410
different libraries these fifteen of the

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,240
language to apply it by really great

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,720
the patient for today is a big community

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,970
and he's only growing and also have to

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,070
announce that there is a book that I am

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,470
present in writing coffee house in a few

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:47,910
months and no news that on a stage

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:50,340
playing or action figures at the moment

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,250
so I would like to invite you to the

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,830
stage so we're going to have questions

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,220
right so let's make a toast okay in

00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,220
question

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,240
so the question is that we said that I

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,370
said using actions and this implies

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,760
grant application so how do we avoid

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:22,100
that so yeah you're right

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,240
so it's not as bad as previously and so

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,280
I think it will know if the only way to

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,520
think two or three times on repentance

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:33,110
what's that and I think the exact

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:37,160
numbers special who would blame in the

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:41,470
film it's the pump asking the thing in

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,470
the Phil I hope your parents tonight

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,990
despondent and what's next when you're

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,050
okay okay so the question is if not

00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,380
fully four previous drop out so Caritas

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,520
is a door Community College there is no

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,670
one company behind them

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,230
so how is work funded so for example my

00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,110
company we're going to support with

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,970
consulting Rouge for radius so you can

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,350
give us money for a support contract and

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,570
I will hire more reward without

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,660
historical reasons there are companies

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,840
like and coral s now right happened and

00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,820
who you know they have products that

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,470
includes prometheus for the roller rink

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,640
because payments now became these model

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,620
thing for me these looks good

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,910
they're pretty development on that even

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,590
before that as well right half between

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,600
the final consultant sound tekzilla'

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,890
some developers did map is also

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,810
integrating three days into their

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,370
products in some pretty cool ways so

00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,080
they are hiring two thumpers closer

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,760
they're also represent general tools and

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,130
plus a few hundred people will wouldn't

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,110
bother to be around but the answer is

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,880
largely the same is most open source

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,710
context which is it's coming more for

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,390
interest whether you're using 3ds

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,310
internally I want to expand this or

00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,900
they're providing support services and

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,040
you know

00:26:52,900 --> 00:27:00,760
a way to advertise in relation to the

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,910
roadmap service folks about confirming

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,150
to Bui using the rewrite and obviously

00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:10,060
want to make some more polish expanding

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,190
like maybe I see lakhs to the various

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,780
and 20 supposed to be having actual and

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,000
people resources be able to do that

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,740
because nobody is a bottleneck how many

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:27,460
people we have especially with the

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:31,390
growing community the state system or

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:37,170
network in the here and now and this

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:37,170
utilize for service system what's the

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,350
weirdest thing the critical factor which

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,710
preaches satellites there's a turns out

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,210
does this company stop spacing out which

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,610
is pretty something like that to

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,920
basically have a satellites in orbit

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,500
which are like to you size and take

00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,050
photos and they're attracting cool to

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,700
remonstrate with radius one of

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,680
satellites I think just the know these

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,050
for possibly wearing those as well we

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,910
also know that boy Japan is running the

00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,310
node exporter on all their like natural

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,860
signaling things those very useful uses

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:18,100
of course someone's the Bitcoin and some

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,140
of them their local petrol prices you

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,020
know temperatures been done environment

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:28,540
I've been done people are doing

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:30,320
everything he tell us a little bit more

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,540
about this

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,600
mr. Sperry this is something we'd

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,870
welcome describe some memories and some

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,150
time series databases already okay and

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,290
so the question is tell sophomore amount

00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:47,220
of time series not a basement in

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:49,830
committees okay so if you look at

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,080
systems and how databases are designed

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,490
there is only so many models for doing

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,440
it and so we're using like simple

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,240
sciences emphasis also equal see these

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,190
big tree design suspiciously similar

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,680
because basically what it to design

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,050
studies so you've got your two hour

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,850
block creation is just getting it old

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,710
enough and something that's old tucking

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,290
up the memory through our community and

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,970
like a nice so in the queries needed

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,760
comedians has all these knocks on this

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:20,640
so birthday go three blocks says only

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,370
next same life do you know that a little

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,160
explore to see news I go preach of those

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,420
and then is something that all together

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,860
and then that thought has contains we

00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,080
written to to take ahead block which is

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,030
entirely new memory and today and that's

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,590
all free eating down through so it's a

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,500
pretty good to go down because I think

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,750
if a be a movie has a good talk or the

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,460
story of sixteen bytes of scale the last

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:47,090
bump up which we probably get most

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,090
