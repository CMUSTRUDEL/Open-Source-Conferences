long tail of web applications so you may

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,629
have heard the concept of long tail

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,299
which was made popular by Chris Anderson

00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:16,160
and and particularly mention it in

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,650
relations to bookstores

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,019
so if you look at the red the red part

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,519
on the graph of the graph so if you're

00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,500
talking about bookstores for example

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,000
that would be the traditional bookstores

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,999
the physical ones the brick and motar

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,499
ones and our auras on telly you would

00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:32,210
see the number of books available on

00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:34,579
those bookstores so you have only a very

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,980
few of you number of books there but

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:40,489
they are bust bestsellers so you sell a

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,590
lot of them and what habit Amazon did

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,590
for example is that they were able to

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,170
mate to put a lot of books online but

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,480
sell only a few number of those as low

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,430
as one one book for example but if you

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,260
compute the surface of the yellow part

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,489
or the red part they actually they're

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,929
actually the yellow part is actually

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,620
quite large and can be larger than the

00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:02,420
red one so for applications it's a bit

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,489
the same we have traditional ways of

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,800
developing software and that's on the

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,750
right part so you have when you

00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,580
developing a few applications globally

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,740
because it cost a lot you need to gather

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,870
a team of developers and it takes time

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,120
to do so that's why the application cost

00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,790
can be quite high on the other hand

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,370
every day when we go to work we have a

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,080
lot of very small needs you're you're

00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,390
taking some information from one place

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,030
taking it from another one merging them

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,470
together display in a certain way or you

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,390
would like to do something very specific

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,160
to your needs and you can't find an

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,470
application for that because it's very

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,090
specific for you need and if you had to

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,380
gather a team of developers then that

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,750
would just be take too long and too

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,480
costly and you wouldn't do it so this is

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,310
what we wanted to address and this is

00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,900
this was typically addressed with Excel

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,760
for example which is a good tool for

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,940
creating some small things with macros

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,010
but not so great for the web so xwiki is

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,660
one of the solutions to try to address

00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,730
this so what is X we T so it's a it's a

00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,740
wiki you probably all know what a wiki

00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,780
is so it's a good place where you can

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,050
edit edit content very quickly at

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,360
content etc so this is a X wiki's an

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:15,530
advanced wiki but that's not really the

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,840
focus here it's also a web a runtime web

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,560
development platform so this is just a

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,709
quick arc

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
texture so very quickly it runs on the

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:28,160
Java servlet container and it provides a

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,650
lot of features a lot of api's and UIs

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,170
in various domains you know a notation

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,630
dashboard blog whatever there are over

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,790
700 extensions but what's important is

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,090
the part at the top is that you are

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,390
actually able inside wiki pages to put

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,670
some squid and call those api's or call

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,680
any of the P is that exist to create

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,950
your own application so this is what I

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:59,060
want to I want to demonstrate quickly in

00:02:51,950 --> 00:03:02,420
a demo so if you install X wiki this is

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,430
what you will get on the first run so

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,680
this is a page typical page you can edit

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,739
the page so this is normal wiki can

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,690
change it in WYSIWYG or wiki but the

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,760
important part is here on the left you

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,349
can in more application you can install

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,420
new application but you can also create

00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:19,489
your own so imagine that I'm somewhere

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,989
in my wiki and I'm using the wiki for

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,850
various information and suddenly I would

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,100
like I come in in the morning and I

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,350
would like to create holiday request

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,750
application for for people who are

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,299
working with this wiki for example so I

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,470
can click create your own here and I

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,780
enter an application called application

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,970
within minutes allowing me to create

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,760
very quickly a small application so

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,620
let's call that holiday application so

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,380
this is this this is wizard is actually

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,690
going to create wiki pages making up

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,450
this application so the case second step

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,560
is creating the structure for my from my

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,850
holiday request so I need ok user that

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,470
would be the employee be for example

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:05,030
requesting the the holiday it might we

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:14,480
need a date for example a start date for

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:17,180
the and then oops sorry I hit enter what

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,209
we will need also a static list for

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,970
example for defining the different

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:30,850
options like pending a pending

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:33,440
application a refused and accepted

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,490
so I'm just going to remove the default

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:41,660
being proposed here okay

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,450
done and I can add a number a number of

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,510
days for example okay that's good enough

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,580
for now let me move to the next step so

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:56,600
next step is is I can choose some icon

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,360
for my my application let's take this

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,630
one and I can say where I want to create

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,280
those new holiday requesting the wiki

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:08,270
I'm not going to enforce that right now

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,400
and the last step is it's going the this

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,850
wizard is going to generate a table a

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,070
life table of the different fields for

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,580
me to view the entries so I can choose

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:24,950
to display the fields that I created in

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:30,500
do in this table for example and I'm

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:34,100
going to remove the default ones and

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,690
that's it so here what this is the

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,460
application now if you look on the left

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,880
top you see there's a new application

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,500
being available in the wiki and and I

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
have a table an empty one right now but

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,840
I can add a new entry so let's say

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,120
Vincent one and you see instead of

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,010
adding unstructured data I'm able to

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,080
enter structured data corresponding to

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,490
the model that I've created so I don't

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,450
have a lot of employees in my wiki so

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,050
I've got a nice trader

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:04,010
let's say it's starting tomorrow and

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,860
let's say that it's going to be for 105

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,590
days I don't I can say pending for one

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,720
year I didn't put a default value okay

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,600
so this is creating a page rendering it

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,820
and if I go back to my life's table have

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,070
now one entry that can be filtered etc

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,010
so easy in a few minutes I've been able

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,200
to create a data structure in the wiki

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:29,060
to make this very small application so I

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,680
want to go back to the slides now so

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,540
that's a very quick application what

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,030
I've demonstrated here demonstrated here

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,060
was the ability to create structure in

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,520
wiki pages but we can do a lot more of

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,800
course you can have scripting in wiki

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,940
pages to do any actions you want based

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
on the data query the

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,930
data that you've created for example

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,230
send an email or do whatever you want

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,000
you can inject CSS JavaScript you can

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,910
install or remove existing extensions

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,580
and those can bring new api's on your UI

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,150
in your wiki and of course you can

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,900
modify the skin the themes and various

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,060
parts of the UI as you wish so if we go

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,980
back a bit step back a bit if you take

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,800
the traditional ways of creating an

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,260
application so you use a general-purpose

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,420
language for example such as C or Java

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,490
or Python or whatever so you have

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,740
building blocks and you build them to

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,570
build a runtime something that executes

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,610
that's the traditional way what we're

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,860
doing here is we're taking a wrong turn

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,650
that exists that the xwiki runtime and

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,020
we're able to actually modify as much as

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,450
we want from it so remove pieces add

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,580
pieces create your own pieces to morph

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,220
it into exactly the application you want

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,120
it to be that's the capability of of

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,460
xwiki

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,500
and that's what make it a web

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,230
application web development application

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,080
platform so just quickly to show you

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,240
here we this is an example you don't

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,790
need to read those it's very small but

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,070
this is an example of what people have

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,740
done with xwiki on this is coming from

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,060
the xwiki dot org website I just wanted

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,710
to show you because they're all very

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,419
different they're all using these

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,010
different capabilities to actually do

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,900
something from widely different and

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:15,050
using xwiki really as a web application

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:18,260
platform for all their needs so in

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,180
conclusion what we see here is that we

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,040
have a way of developing application in

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,840
an actor iterative way because

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,110
everything we do is in wiki pages and

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,120
wiki pages are versioned so you can

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,520
progressively do make modification in

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
places in the wiki go back do that

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,719
collaboratively with several people

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,969
compare what they've done with this etc

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,680
it's continuous delivery of course

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,930
because as soon as you make modification

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,729
in a wiki page and you save the page

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,890
then the action executed the change

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,690
execute immediately and you get to see

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,900
the result if you don't like it you can

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,580
roll back or make more edit to make more

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,070
modification it's nice for working

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,050
collaboratively together with several

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,620
people on the same application

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,300
and it works from day one yes because of

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,740
course the runtime is there you able to

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,120
go to have the runtime

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,770
sometimes when you're starting from

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,740
scratch it's quite a while to actually

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,180
get something know that you can show and

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,540
you can really work on because you need

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,920
to put together all the bits and pieces

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:20,209
so it's open source and on

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,860
community-based - thank you very much we

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:37,730
leave the time for questions now thank

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:40,220
you so the question the question is I

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,470
said that we have api's can we use those

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,570
api's for example to query the data that

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,730
were entered in for example the holiday

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,529
request application and yes so we have a

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,170
lot of api's one of them is a query API

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,750
and we have a query language we call it

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,709
X wql X wiki query language it's just a

00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,230
super set of data ql that exists and is

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,240
standard in the in the java world and

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,570
you're able to say finally all the pages

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,079
that have metadata of this type of this

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,970
holiday type and with the additional

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,640
criteria for filtering if I want and

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,800
this gives me a list and then I can I

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,660
can iterate over this list in various

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,300
languages I mentioned some languages

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:25,660
here you can you can code this in in

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,779
velocity in groovy in Python in in

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,510
Patel's

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,850
Ruby and and there are a few more

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,410
actually in JavaScript so you can use

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,209
the language that you want a scripting

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,910
language that you prefer iterate over

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,290
this list so you get the data and you

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,149
can do whatever we want with the data

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,180
you can present them the way you want

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:48,020
you can do action on them and that

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,380
everything you want more questions yes

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,380
here

00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:22,780
this one so the question is do I need to

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:24,730
care about safety issues so there is a

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,530
so the question is should I be concerned

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,170
about xwiki safety because there are a

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,780
lot of parts that exist already the we

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,640
have a security model that exists based

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,350
on permissions so you've got permissions

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,140
at various level at the level of the

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,750
wiki itself the full level so like edit

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,470
who is able to edit content who is able

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,730
to delete pages create pages etc

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,470
permission for writing scripts in pages

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,360
so you can do that at the global level

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,510
you can do it at the level of each page

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,790
also or each subset of pages the page

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,620
and the children so at all levels you

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,970
have that so you can you can set it if

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,850
you're concerned about that and you want

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,650
only to give access to some people so

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,940
you can do it at the top level for

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,580
example and that will that will cover

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,680
the whole the whole thing or you can

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,600
decide to recover to disallow for

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,970
example at the whole level but allow at

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,430
a very given level so you want to give

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,820
access for some sub parts for example in

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,550
the wiki so they all they all all those

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,880
all those blocks are are built under

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,170
this constraint of this security model

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,110
then it's up to you whether you want to

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,150
use this security model not or not but

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,580
by default it's it's built in and it's

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:42,180
there and it is used yes yep another

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,180
question may be I don't see up

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,740
so the question is can we also work with

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,510
anthologies and build semantic wiki I'm

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,430
not very familiar with this I know there

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,230
was a research project in the past that

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,610
was doing that what it was doing I don't

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,390
know if that answers your question it

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:04,330
was trying to take freeform content in

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,550
wiki pages and derive some structure

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,920
from it automatically so maybe that's a

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:22,000
bit different it was like a semantic

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:24,220
understanding of content yes well that's

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
okay yeah so that's the so we have the

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,900
we have the structure in the wiki then

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,360
for exporting that it's just it's a

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,740
matter of for example creating a page so

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,570
we have that for example when we

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,380
generate if you want to generate RSS for

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:40,810
example you know in a in a wiki page we

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,640
have some scripts and we do the query

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,650
that's what was mentioned before to

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,350
gather the data and then we just put the

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,420
format that we want in output so you can

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,430
you can generate RDF or anything there

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,860
and then you just need under URL you

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,750
just need to provide the URL to

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:03,400
something external or anywhere and this

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:05,200
will generate the ID RDF one more

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,590
question and that's the only the last

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,850
one no okay

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:17,970
thank you very much

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:17,970
