all right people quiet

00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,170
thank you

00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:30,160
well good morning fuzz them whoo so it's

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:40,310
a celebration year this year this year

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:42,020
free software is 35 years old and that

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,000
that's that's one of the things I'm

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,930
celebrating but today specifically

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,640
February the 3rd is the day that

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:55,550
Christine Peterson first proposed the

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:58,250
the words open-source as the slogan or

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,100
the name for a marketing program for

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,720
free software to help it get adopted by

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,270
businesses in the way that in 1998

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,729
Mozilla had just been created as a

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,860
project they're a whole group of people

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,740
who felt that that was the time that

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,200
free software was ready to move into the

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,450
business sector and so that there is

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,870
another celebration today which is today

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,990
is the 20th anniversary of the start of

00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,510
the open-source movement in software my

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,760
name is simon phipps i am the president

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,560
of the open source initiative and I've

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,299
got my colleague it's olivine Yali over

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,380
here who is my bodyguard and the

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:43,729
co-director of the of the organization

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,520
and he'll step in when I flake out so

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,119
let's just look back before open source

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,790
and before open source there were two

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,830
significant movements in what we now

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,229
call free software and open source

00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,260
there was the BSD movement and that's

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:03,259
why Bill joy is on the screen there and

00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:06,259
in many ways that was the progenitor of

00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,289
what is now open-source taking BSD UNIX

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,530
and using it very successfully for

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:14,919
commercial purposes and then on the

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,749
other coast there was Richard Stallman

00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,530
Richard Stallman being very irritated to

00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:21,319
have his

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,620
it's abridged in connection with some

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:28,819
software and deciding that he would do

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:33,290
something about it and he codified the

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:36,620
idea of being thoroughly decent to each

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,560
other into four freedoms which in my

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,590
words rather than his are the freedom to

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,080
use software for any purpose the freedom

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,910
to study it and understand it the

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,680
freedom to improve it so that it better

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,200
fits your needs or the needs of people

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,870
you care about and the freedom to share

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,350
the original or modified versions with

00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:01,100
whoever you wish and those four freedoms

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,920
are resident of other attempts to codify

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,420
freedom in the history of philosophy and

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,660
they still ring true today as the core

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,140
of what makes software succeed in the

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:20,120
21st century now for a whole variety of

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:23,900
reasons that idea was beginning to be

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,269
adopted in the mid 1990s I was working

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,640
for IBM in the mid-1990s and I worked on

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,480
a project involving the java programming

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,420
language and although people tend to be

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,709
cautious about referring to java in the

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:43,010
same breath as open-source the release

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,590
of java in 1995 showed the power of

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,750
releasing software freely with the

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,850
permissions provided it was

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,890
revolutionary to put the source code of

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,410
a new product on the internet which

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,820
itself was only about three years old in

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,489
public terms the source code of java was

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,160
published freely in 1995 and it was that

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:06,440
that led to its massive adoption in

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,410
business and that made it clear to

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,980
everybody that using openness as a

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,739
business tool actually had some legs and

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,220
so that the movement gradually grew and

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,500
by 1998 it became obvious to a whole

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,680
group of people that there was the need

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,860
for a way to explain free software to

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,979
business in terms of its benefits rather

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,210
than in terms of its ethics this is not

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,120
to say that the ethics were

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,250
relevant people have ethics should have

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,490
ethics and should live by them but

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,919
corporations live by by laws and by

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,650
shareholder benefit and you can't

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,960
persuade a corporation to be ethical

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,759
because corporations aren't people that

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,840
they're much closer to reptiles in fact

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,419
there's an essay about that if you want

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,069
to go look it up and so a group of

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,349
people decided to start a marketing

00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:02,060
program for free software and bruce

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,570
perens who's one of the founders of ice

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,830
I explained recently in a blog post that

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,349
open-source is the proper name of a

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,690
campaign to promote the pre-existing

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:14,680
concept of free software to business and

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,930
the certified licenses to a rule set I

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,599
want to make it absolutely clear that

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,639
from the beginning open source and free

00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:25,340
software were never intended to be

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,070
different things now there were some

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,229
people who had a grudge against the GPL

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,750
and Richard Stallman who wanted to make

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,580
you think that and some of them got

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,659
involved in the early life of the open

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,699
source movement but today open source is

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,039
back in this place it is a marketing

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,610
program for free software it is ground

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,030
for collaboration it is what unites us

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,520
rather than what should divide us it is

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,590
their providing a signal about the

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,690
difference between freedom and commerce

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,900
this is the dock cranes in New Jersey

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,240
and Statue of Liberty obviously Statue

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,889
of Liberty in her famous pose signaling

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,330
Liberty I believe this has been

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,330
discontinued in America now but

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,340
the dock cranes are in the same posture

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,220
they want you to think that Commerce is

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,260
the same thing as Liberty and we

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,940
discover in the four freedoms that

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,140
actually Commerce and Liberty are a

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,870
little different they're connected and

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,850
there is no point in diminishing either

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,540
of them but they're different things you

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,210
have to guard them open source as a

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,980
concept I believe was wildly successful

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,360
I believe that it was the the key to

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,780
helping software users and developers

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,169
advance software freedom at work as well

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,450
as in their private time and I don't

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,150
know how many people here are working

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,490
are actually paid salaries because of

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,100
free software how many just let's have a

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,570
wave how many people that's a lot of

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,300
people how many people wish their

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:10,860
salaries were paid by free software okay

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,770
that's everybody else it turns out that

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,960
open source was the key to unlock the

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,120
move of software freedom into business

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,360
and so we started the first decade of

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,490
open source at the end of the 1990s I

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,520
would say that that first decade was

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,880
characterized by advocacy I was it was

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,310
Punkie advocacy it was willing to call

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,990
companies what they really were it was

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,979
willing to publish the Halloween letters

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,070
on a website and harass Microsoft it was

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,330
willing to say rude things to people and

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,770
sometimes to nice people

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:49,140
and it was also characterized by the

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,720
evolution of open-source licensing and

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,910
it was characterized by endless endless

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,490
debate about open source business models

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,740
now to be clear open source projects

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,780
don't have a business model companies

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,130
have business models open source

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,530
projects have developers and

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,180
collaboration and so there was a lot of

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,100
confusion in this decade where people

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,020
thought about the business model too

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,870
much and thought about the community too

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:19,500
little and tried to exploit licensing to

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,800
try and advantage that back then OSI was

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,450
pretty clear it was in existence to be

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,540
the steward of the open source

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:30,190
definition

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:32,979
and to be the the Nexus of deciding

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,890
which licenses actually delivered the

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,470
Four Freedoms the way that OS I went

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,970
about that was by having Bruce parents

00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,720
take the Debian free software guidelines

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:46,180
and adapt them into a set of rules

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,150
called the open source definition to

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,310
decide which licenses deliver on the

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,170
four freedoms and which don't and I

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,290
believe this was crucial to the success

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,990
of open source because it meant that we

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,050
as developers don't have to go ask a

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,970
lawyer if that license gives us the

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,440
freedoms that we need to collaborate

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,970
with the other people in the community

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,620
and by having that consensus of all of

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,500
the people in the open-source community

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,960
that these licenses are okay and we can

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,990
safely collaborate with them and well

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,230
the other licenses I'm not so sure about

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:26,380
by gathering that consensus in

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:29,800
crystallizing it and remembering it the

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,020
open source definition created the

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,120
freedom to make open source software all

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,270
over the world and I think that was

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,620
crucial a few things happen in that

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,380
decade that's how little looked through

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,650
here you know so I was formed Linux was

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:48,630
apparently a cancer there was a whole

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:53,380
load of new licenses came out in 2002

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:56,290
SCO's sued IBM just as I was just having

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,570
to somebody a moment ago about how all

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,220
the crooks all flood in whenever there's

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,980
a big money opportunity they're doing it

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,630
now in cryptocurrency and they did it

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,380
then in the world of Linux where there

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,180
was obviously an opportunity the the

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:15,220
halloween' documents kind of got boring

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:19,480
around 2004 unix when open source in

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,800
2005 in the tape of sun solaris we did

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,510
some stuff around open standards we're

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,470
going to come back to that did you know

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,750
there's a thing called the open

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,570
standards requirement for open source

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,640
software was extensively discussed in

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,160
2005 and we thought we'd put the subject

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,870
to bed but it's coming back it's it's

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,890
woken up and it's looking for its

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,520
cookies Java became open-source I was

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,880
one of the people

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,030
volved in doing that that was cool yep

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,480
so by the end of that decade most CIO CI

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,340
CI o--'s understood the idea of open

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,960
source and most of them thought it was a

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,330
benefit there were still a few who

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,610
thought it wasn't and the things that

00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,490
made open source succeed were first of

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:04,110
all that crystallization of consensus

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,630
about which licenses are okay

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,120
secondly the the idea of those licenses

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,250
being the consensus of a community about

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,010
what freedoms are needed rather than

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,350
grounds for a lawsuit and finally the

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,840
idea of communities creating safe spaces

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,820
where the mutual interests of the

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,370
participants were insulated from each

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,050
other that crystallization of consensus

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:32,560
process the way that works is well a

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:35,110
while back someone accused OSI of trying

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,270
to play King it was you know who died

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,670
and made you King of licenses they said

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,350
to us and I thought about that well

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,450
we're not actually the king of licenses

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,420
we're more the speaker of the house of

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,130
licenses we get all of the delegates of

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,860
the community which is well all of you

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,780
if you want to and we all discuss

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,930
whether a given open-source license

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,540
delivers the Four Freedoms and then

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,570
somebody summarizes that discussion and

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,150
if there's no dissent the OSI board then

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,910
vote to say that that license is

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,250
open-source or to say actually the

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:12,040
consensus was that we we didn't think it

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,850
was open source OSI doesn't actually

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,710
decide which licenses are open source it

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,270
crystallizes the consensus of the

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,250
community that gathers on the license

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,220
discuss mailing lists and that's what

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,400
gives it its power because it isn't my

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,980
opinion about which licenses are ok by

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,140
the way if you're a corporate lawyer it

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,540
doesn't do you any good to contact the

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,740
president of OSI and asked for help

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,170
getting your license approved because

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,530
actually I don't really I only have one

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,720
vote and my one vote is cast along with

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,540
the other 10 directors and the directors

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,950
only cast their vote after they've been

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,080
given the consensus from the

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,120
conversation on license discuss

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,680
and so that's not the way you get your

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,600
license approve it in fact if you come

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,310
and ask me for help that's a reasonably

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,630
good indicator your license isn't going

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,190
to get approved secondly about licenses

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,740
now if you if you're involved in

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,710
business you know that licenses are the

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,840
grounds for lawsuits or rather they are

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,150
the the peace treaty between two

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,050
reptiles about who is going to get to

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:22,240
control the territory and it turns out

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,400
that open source licenses are sometimes

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
taken that way sometimes people think

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,310
that an open source license needs

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,800
negotiating or needs discussing between

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,960
the parties who are involved I don't

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,810
believe it's like that Evon once said

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,450
that licenses are constitutions for

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,670
communities and I very much agree with

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,050
that as an idea I think an open-source

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,880
license is the the multilateral

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,240
consensus of the permissions and norms

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,040
of a community and this is why another

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,590
word to anyone who's involved in

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,980
corporate open source this is why gaming

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:03,730
the license makes people hate you it's

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,820
because the license is not the thing the

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,010
community is the thing the license is

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,070
simply the summary of the freedoms that

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,350
the community needs and so if you go in

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,270
and gain the license and your game

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,700
doesn't reflect the behavior of the

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,240
community then everybody will hate what

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,430
you were doing and and that's the reason

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,100
why so many people dislike it when

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,830
companies like VMware decide to mess

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,740
with software in violation of the way

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,880
that the community feels it should go

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,310
forget whether they're doing it legally

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,380
or illegally they're doing it

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,360
dishonorably and that's the reason they

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,980
should stop doing it unfortunately

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,210
they're a corporation and not a person

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,210
than you know what corporations are

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,980
open-source communities also create safe

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,540
spaces I mean the exemplar of this in

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,840
many ways is the Apache Software

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,560
Foundation a community creates a space

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:03,150
in which the control points of what's

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,130
called intellectual property are are

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,030
defined they are their poison is taken

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,770
away

00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,080
we're the business models of the

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,740
participants are left outside the room

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:18,070
and we're code is made available even if

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,990
I don't know you I do hear some people

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,570
who worry that their code is going to be

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,000
used in a way that they don't like

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,160
I'd suggest you that if if that's one of

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,620
your fears that you don't make it open

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,810
source in the first place because one of

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,780
the points of open source is to make

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:39,400
code available for the unknown others it

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:42,030
is okay to go into a code base and pick

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,690
up the algorithm that they're using for

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:48,970
whatever it is great to go harvest body

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,800
organs from big open source projects and

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:56,260
build your own zombie that is the whole

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,670
point of open source is that you're able

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,000
to do whatever you want with the code

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,950
and if that's what you want to do saying

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,540
that people shouldn't do that because

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,120
they're not contributing to the project

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,920
is kind of somehow strange and so we

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,980
protect that right of code for the

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,280
unknown others along with the idea of

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,110
getting the control points out and of

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,400
well getting the control points out

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,100
there there are a number of control

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,600
points they I've got a useful acronym

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,280
for intellectual property down there if

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,280
you don't if you can work out what it is

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,680
intellectual probably needs mitigating

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,260
in open source communities I hear people

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,970
saying that people are throwing away

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,130
their IP when they do open source

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,170
they're not doing that what they're

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,560
doing is they're leveraging their IP and

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,290
they're leveraging their IP to enable a

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,350
community to collaborate if your

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,270
business model is advantaged by people

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,710
collaborating around the code then you

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:58,810
suspend your IP on making that happen

00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,980
of course if your project is as much but

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,990
if your your goals are much better

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,180
achieved by living in splendid isolation

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,890
and shooting people as they come towards

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,160
you where you probably don't want to

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:13,360
mitigate the IP and then business models

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,730
there's been a whole range of business

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,319
models down the years I believe the one

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,630
that we're heading towards is the bottom

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,560
one assembling complex systems I'll come

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,140
on to that in a little while

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,520
opensource removes the barriers to

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,370
collaboration it creates a safe space

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,650
and this is why actually the the

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,870
discussion about codes of conduct is so

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:38,050
important to us because we need a safe

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,640
place to contribute as people as well as

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,670
a safe place to contribute as

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,440
programmers and that's the reason we

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,420
need to have a code of conduct in a

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,160
community so that everybody knows that

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,620
they are entering a place that is safe

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:56,740
for them as people as well as prout as

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,050
programmers ok second decade by the

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,560
second decade of open-source we will

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,760
well into the the mode of adoption

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,800
open-source was in the ascendancy at

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,110
this point and that the big themes for

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,760
me during those 10 years were broad

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,510
enterprise adoption of open source

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,080
software lots of discussions about

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:20,260
software patents and a rise in the

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,330
desire to enforce the GPL against

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,190
scofflaws who were deciding to

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,410
intentionally break it as well as a

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,020
desire to enforce the GPL against the

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:33,820
uneducated who accidentally infringed

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:36,430
against it so far fewer exciting bullets

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,120
in this decade it was just all adoption

00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,520
and encode for me in that decade one

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,930
highlight is Microsoft loving Linux I

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,680
thought that was that was quite a

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,150
highlight 2015 and you'll have to catch

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,280
me at the booth really to talk about

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,020
that in any depth but I think that there

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,020
are parts of Microsoft that love Linux

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,290
the big deal though is that by the end

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,150
of this decade

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,150
you could truthfully say that

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,950
open-source was everywhere you could

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:12,790
look at open source and identify it as

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:15,940
one of or the dominant patterns in the

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,770
way that enterprise and and civil

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,850
society software was created and

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,950
maintained now let us talk about

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,640
patterns for a bit

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,679
what's wrong with software patents well

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,840
they're sort of intellectual reasons why

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,140
you might dislike giving people a

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,440
monopoly over an idea

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,810
but the real problem in open-source with

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,360
patents is that they break that safe

00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,420
space we were talking about they they

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,560
create a place where developers have to

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:53,080
seek permission in order to innovate and

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,630
all the things that we did creating

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,820
open-source communities were all about

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,340
obviating the need to go ask permission

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,130
before you innovate you're supposed to

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,860
be able to find a handy giant and climb

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:10,390
on its shoulders you shouldn't have to

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:12,640
ask the giant first and so patents break

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,620
that they mean there are hidden reasons

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,660
why you always have to go and ask

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,580
somebody who doesn't know anything about

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,510
what you're doing if you may have

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,360
permission to proceed and and developers

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,250
instinctively mistrust that

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,810
instinctively hate the idea that they're

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,390
going to do something really clever and

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:34,180
then some lawyer is going to show up and

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,030
demand all of their living in exchange

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:41,200
for the right to use the clever thing

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,690
they just did and so developers avoid

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,180
things where they know there are patents

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,860
unless they're being paid by corporation

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:53,350
to go there of course and in particular

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,630
developers avoid standards where there

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,660
are patents we've seen it time and time

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,870
again we've seen people avoid MPEG we've

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,510
seen people avoid mp3 and we're going to

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,210
continue to see it now one of the ways

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:10,570
you fix these things is by using open

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:14,310
source licenses that have been approved

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:18,520
by OSI and have been recently written to

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:22,830
deal at least partly with the problem of

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,320
patents and for me when I see a company

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:29,140
newly deciding to use the BSD or MIT

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,830
licenses my first reaction is I wonder

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,390
who they want to sue I don't know

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,010
whether you think that I've looked it

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,840
and I think what why would you do that

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,730
why wouldn't you use the apache license

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,380
where we can keep the patents out and so

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,510
this this we discussed this extensively

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,809
in 2005

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,690
we had a long discussion at OSI about

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,820
the role of patents in standards and

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,620
open source and we came up with the open

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,840
source requirement the open standards

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,450
requirement for open source but it turns

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:06,070
out that the problem was not settled in

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:08,980
in back in decade one decade to the

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,809
wireless industry in particular back in

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,320
those decades wasn't really involved in

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:16,090
open source they they didn't didn't

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,040
dramatically get themselves involved in

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,809
the argument about standards essential

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,240
patents and open source software and

00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:26,169
they have a different way of doing

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,250
things in the ICT industry we go through

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:34,450
a cycle of we invent we monetize and

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,880
then we standardize and standardize is

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,030
in many ways a way of diminishing the

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,590
power of the successful implementation

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,020
in the wireless industry they work a

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,530
completely different way they start out

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:50,650
by specifying what a system is going to

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,980
do and then they ask all of the smartest

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,980
people in their industry to invent a

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,740
solution for that specification and then

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,080
they pick the best solution and they

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,970
make that the standard and then

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,190
everybody implements the standard and

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,880
the people's whose solution was picked

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,790
get to get paid by patent royalties on

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,370
the technologies in the standard it all

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,169
works very well for them they're very

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,410
happy with it and they make a lot of

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:22,299
money and they think it's normal they

00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,429
think it's just as normal as you think

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:27,669
it's normal to not have patents on the

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:29,860
software that you're working on and if

00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:32,230
you were to ever bring these two worlds

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,540
together you could be sure they would be

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,669
conflict you could be sure that if the

00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,710
wireless industry ever decided it wasn't

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,600
going to work with silicon and wires and

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,610
aerials and wanted to somehow work with

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,460
software that there would be a clash of

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:50,110
cultures now I'm sorry to have to tell

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,780
you that 5g is bringing those two worlds

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,940
together and the wireless industry has

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,230
showed up and wants to make what we're

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,290
doing impossible and this is going to be

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,280
a problem on for

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:06,230
generally okay we'll come back to that

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,670
point in a minute the other thing that

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,850
happened in the second decade was the

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,590
rise of Licensing for enforcement now

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,510
I'm a skeptic when it comes to licensed

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,730
enforcement I think that the outcome of

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,290
license enforcement is this you have a

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,110
perfectly good Rock you can't use

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:27,470
anymore and a car that doesn't Drive and

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:29,630
really you know I feel that it's very

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,330
important for people to comply with open

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,180
source licenses because that we already

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,980
have a word for people who don't satisfy

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,510
the terms of open source licenses and

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,700
yet used the software we call them

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:45,530
pirates

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:47,660
so VMware is a pirate and I think that

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,230
it's wrong for them to engage in acts of

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,820
piracy because they are using software

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,000
in breach of the license and therefore

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,290
they don't have a copyright license now

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,090
what do you do about that that's a

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:04,970
different question and and I took the

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,980
slide out look at that what do you do

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:12,020
about that the best thing to do about it

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:15,320
is to help them to understand how wicked

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:19,190
you they are and then to get on with

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,190
success in a different place and that

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,740
sounds very difficult to do but in

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:29,170
open-source we are succeeding in so many

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,400
places that to distract ourselves by

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,660
deciding that we're going to focus on a

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,780
particular even a particular malevolent

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,400
pirate I believe diminishes us and so

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,170
you can tell that I'm a skeptic on this

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,240
subject however I think it's perfectly

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,830
reasonable if you are part of an

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,140
open-source project that wants to go and

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,420
use a lawsuit to enforce your project

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,100
for you to do that and so I'm not going

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,080
to stop you doing it but I'm probably

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:59,120
not going to help so end of two decades

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,370
yesterday was the end of the two decades

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,250
and the lessons so far first of all

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,380
we're now operating under new rules the

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,030
signs that were all put up before the

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,460
open source Revolution started are no

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,680
longer valid

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,470
secondly the real value of open source

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,200
it's to innovate without having to ask

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,120
it's to start where others have reached

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,000
it's to stay in control of your own

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,250
resources while you're doing that it's

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,160
to share in the upkeep of your

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:32,760
innovation so that you can move on to

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,980
new innovation it's to influence global

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,080
ecosystems with your software in a way

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,690
that was beyond the reach of individual

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,670
developers before open source and it's

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,980
also to be protected from other people

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,080
who are doing that as well now all of

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,100
those things are derived from software

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,760
freedom software freedom is the key to

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:59,640
all of those commercial values that

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,230
open-source was coined to embody I'd say

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,060
that new technologies these days are

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,100
only possible with open-source if you

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,190
want to do cloud and you want to be able

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,440
to make it scale unless you happen to

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,330
own every last piece of copyright in the

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,310
stack you're almost certainly going to

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:19,230
have to use open-source that by the way

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:21,390
is why Microsoft loves Linux if you're

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,790
going to do an IOT device the chances

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,190
are you can't afford to pay a royalty on

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,810
every single raspberry pie that ever

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,640
might be used to do the thing that

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,980
you're going to do and you have to use

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,980
open source it's hard to imagine how you

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,170
would do these things without it and so

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,060
we're coming into this third decade of

00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,850
open source with open source as the

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,190
default open source is the software

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:48,450
approach that you need if you're going

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:50,280
to do cool new things so the question

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,170
has to arise of well you know what's

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,080
coming next well the first thing that's

00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,760
coming is that OSI has changed

00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,700
we started out being an organization

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,860
that simply was the steward of the open

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,440
source definition and the steward of the

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:07,350
license list today we're we're kind of

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,160
the the association of open source

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,720
associations we have a large number of

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,540
affiliates this is a selection of them

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,450
and we would be very pleased for your

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,880
project to join us I so that we can help

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,760
connect you with other projects and so

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,400
that when necessary we can represent you

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,840
in places where you find it harder to

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,370
have

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,600
and I'll be talking about a little bit

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:36,450
about that in a moment some other things

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,230
that are coming I here's my five

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,929
predictions for the decade first

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,759
prediction is that I think we're going

00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:48,090
to see a gradual change of community

00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,549
styles in the first decade communities

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:54,409
were all about enthusiasts it was that

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:59,549
first decade that that started for them

00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:02,429
for them still embodies that relaxed

00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:05,460
atmosphere of individual participation

00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:07,740
and contribution and that first decade

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,440
was very much characterized by

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,019
individual projects and by the

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,119
enthusiasm of individuals that rapidly

00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:19,320
changed into a world of professional

00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,860
specialists and of projects hosted in

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,600
charities and in the third decade I

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,129
think we're going to gradually move into

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,220
a world where most software is

00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:32,039
professional generalists working with

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,299
software that's hosted in consortio now

00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,059
that may not be the world that you want

00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:39,179
to happen but I unfortunately see it

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:42,389
very much happening it's a world of the

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:46,139
Linux Foundation and of OpenStack and of

00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:48,480
a large consortium of software projects

00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:51,119
come together under a set of common

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,799
community terms and that suits a world

00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,679
where people are dealing with that whole

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,169
stack of software that isn't to say that

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,779
the earlier approaches are diminished or

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:04,320
are going away there is still plenty of

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:07,049
scope to be a focused kernel hacker

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,009
there is still plenty of scope to have a

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:13,529
project which is focused around a

00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,869
community of individuals who have little

00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:18,330
commercial motivation but we're going to

00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:21,059
increasingly see this third mode

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,639
becoming the dominant mode and as that

00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:25,710
happens I believe we need to to create

00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:28,169
cultures of contribution because the the

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,059
thing that happens in that world of

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:32,009
professional generalists and consortium

00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,740
is you begin to take some of the

00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:37,529
projects for granted you you can only

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,720
contribute to so many projects and you

00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:40,920
begin to take projects for granted you

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,380
begin to neglect

00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,940
projects that aren't very exciting you

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,670
begin to neglect projects that you

00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,130
haven't had to improve and so I believe

00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:53,610
that in our work lives we need to

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:57,330
cultivate cultures of contribution we

00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:00,090
need to encourage people wherever they

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,570
are using open-source to think about how

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,060
they can participate in its community

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:09,260
possibly financially preferably in a

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:13,140
social way with social contribution is

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:18,660
documentation bug-fixing case studies

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,890
use cases or possibly with code the

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,200
second thing that's happening is I think

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,080
that we'll see fewer and fewer single

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,600
project companies in the first decade

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,780
the big focus was on open source

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,570
business models and they're really every

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,430
every entrepreneur was busy trying to

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,010
work out how they could create their

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,530
company that was going to embrace open

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,840
source and succeed in the second a

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,620
decade we gradually saw more and more

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,230
people moving to working with a more

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,930
diverse community with projects with

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:55,260
multiple companies involved in them with

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,730
a release train model indicating that

00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,920
there were many voices that had to be

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,590
respected rather than a release when

00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,920
ready which tends to lead towards the

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:08,100
strongest voice controlling the project

00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,270
and in that world I think the business

00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,550
model that's going to become dominant

00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,430
this decade is the complex assembly of

00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,560
simple parts I think we're going to see

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,090
more and more businesses where all of

00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,040
the software they're using is open

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,620
source but the product that they're

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,830
selling is putting it all together into

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,890
a stack that you can use not necessarily

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,680
hosted in the cloud also hosted in your

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,390
enterprise and that skill of knowing how

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,280
to put the parts together how to

00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,380
configure them how to keep them running

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,390
and how to make them scale the demand is

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,840
I believe going to become the core of

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:45,630
the future business models during this

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,320
third decade leading to hopefully

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,320
beautiful things

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,800
in this decade I think we're going to

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,240
see new problems with licensing we're

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,970
going to see two kinds of problems with

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,360
licensing in the first decade everyone

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:07,270
wanted their own license if you look in

00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,570
the license archive you'll see all sorts

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:14,080
of licenses like the the IBM public

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,550
license which arose in that decade IBM

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,200
took their name out of the license

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,640
called it the common public license it

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,900
was still basically the same license

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,820
just didn't say IBM and everyone wanted

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,890
to do that people worked out that wasn't

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,380
such a good idea in the second decade

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,570
and the focus in the second decade came

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,490
gradually became compliance with

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:36,760
reciprocal licenses and the whole

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,720
industry grew up the what what has been

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,350
deliciously called

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,960
the compliance Industrial Complex has

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:48,510
gradually grown up with tooling and

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,400
great big threats of fear around

00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,900
reciprocal license compliance in the

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,950
third decade I think we're going to see

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,040
more and more of a problem with

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,050
attribution license compliance it turns

00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,270
out that those so-called permissive

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,670
licenses that you're using do actually

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,260
have a requirement in them which if you

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:08,560
don't comply with it means that you are

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,060
a pirate and that that requirement is

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
that you give attribution to the

00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,370
previous authors of the code that you're

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,590
using and it turns out that probably

00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,710
your version management system doesn't

00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,780
support that it probably doesn't keep a

00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,429
very good record of who worked on the

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,550
code before you imported it into your

00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,590
version control system and it only keeps

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,640
a modest job of who's contributing to

00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,260
the code while it's in the version

00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,870
control system it's very hard to pull

00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,600
out that statement as a as a block of

00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,310
text to put into a documentation and I

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,130
believe we'll see the rise of the

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:46,030
attribute control during the coming

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:48,970
decade and I think we now understand how

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,340
to comply with the GPL we now understand

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,560
how to do that and if you want to do it

00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,240
you can do it which does rather imply

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,770
that actually if you're not compliant

00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,150
with the GPL you know that you're not

00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:02,140
that you're not doing it and you really

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,880
are an awful person but when it comes to

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,660
attribution licenses I think we're going

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,660
to be faced with

00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,890
so the way you do that is you accumulate

00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,440
you accumulate all of the history around

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,030
the work that you're doing and you make

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,160
sure you've always got a record of

00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,650
everyone who's touched the code so that

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,120
you can attribute to them correctly you

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,370
look in the license to see how you

00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,770
should attribute to them it may be the

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,380
license isn't terribly clear in those

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,970
cases probably whatever you decide to do

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,170
that publicly gives attribution is

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,410
probably okay

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:39,820
but do ask an expert particularly if

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:42,970
you're worth suing and I recommend you

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,530
you only use OSI approved licenses and

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,770
now the reason I recommend that to you

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,610
is I've found that the people who argue

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,350
with the OSI license review process most

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,880
often are people who would like to use a

00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,920
license that OSI wouldn't possibly

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,530
approve

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,660
they're people who would like to put in

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,970
a patent rider in there that lets them

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,220
charge royalties on patents that are

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,930
embodied in the software they're people

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,970
who want to put a time limit on how long

00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,470
you can use the software for there are

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,170
people who want to put a limitation on

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,210
what you can use it for and they tend to

00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,490
say oh open-source that's just a

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,050
descriptive term isn't it no one has the

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,840
right to tell me whether my license is

00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:25,840
okay I suggest to you a biometric

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,120
indicator of a problem is a company in

00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,730
particular that says that open-source is

00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,920
just words and we can use any license we

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,730
want to that we think meets the open

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,520
source definition

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:39,160
I suggest you only use OSI approved

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,510
licenses there are something like 70 of

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,420
them so you should be able to find one

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,460
that's okay and that will help protect

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,530
you from some of the problems that are

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:51,130
going to arise from the new world of

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,480
licensing in this decade I also think

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,120
we're going to rediscover software

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,120
freedom in the first decade of

00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:02,650
open-source open source was very strong

00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:04,210
on being a moral it was not immoral but

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,010
it was very strong on being a moral and

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,770
keeping discussions of morality and

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,690
ethics out of the business of persuading

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,780
businesses to use open source software

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,850
in the second decade open source was

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,770
happy to live in a world of ethics and

00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,830
morals but really was very pragmatic

00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,110
wanted to have those discs

00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,750
in the pub wanted to get on with the

00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:26,450
software at work I believe in the third

00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,580
decade we're going to rediscover the

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:31,130
power of the ethical basis of software

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,010
freedom the reason for that is we're

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,040
going to start encountering areas where

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:40,670
it's not easy to see how open source

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:48,770
applies I think I've probably got a

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:50,840
little longer than that in the coming

00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,900
decades I believe that we're going to

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,390
deal with new problems that require us

00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,190
to go back to first principles go back

00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,440
to saying are we making the software

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,900
available to people for people to study

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,800
are we making the software available for

00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,320
any purpose

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,580
are we actually giving individuals the

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,310
freedom to tinker with the code and the

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,200
answer to those questions diagnosed what

00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,630
our stance towards the public should be

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,190
they diagnose what our stance towards

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,860
our code and towards its licensing

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,310
should be they help us to fix problems

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,130
in open source hardware to fix problems

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,960
in cloud computing and I believe that if

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,520
we don't do that we're going to come

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,990
back to the mistakes that we had to deal

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,570
with in the first and second decades

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:38,870
we're going to have to deal with people

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,820
who forget that licenses are not the

00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,830
core of open source that actually

00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,260
freedom is the core of open source and

00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,930
people exercising it and the licenses

00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,820
are just the the rules about how that

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:54,530
should happen I also hope that OSI is

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,600
going to have some new roles in the

00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,760
first decade we were we were all about

00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,590
approving licenses in the second decade

00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,910
we were all about not approving licenses

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:07,130
and by the way if you do want to get a

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,880
new license approved I've got some

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,350
advice for you please don't try it

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,950
really you get a very rough reception

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:17,360
most of them have been tried and the

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,580
ones that haven't been tried haven't

00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,530
been tried for really good reasons and

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,460
so please you know we're pretty much

00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:28,640
done on licenses maintenance yes new

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,960
licenses probably not but you could

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,170
maybe prove me wrong and come up with

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,000
something incredibly innovative

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,220
so in the third decade we're focusing

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,640
much more on communities and on

00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:42,070
authenticity we're very keen to connect

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,580
communities together to to bridge

00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:48,610
between worlds and I believe we need to

00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,910
do that more than ever at the moment I'd

00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,830
encourage you to join and this is an

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,230
American terminology of course I'd

00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,930
encourage you to join Kara T's as well

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,190
as trade associations your employer

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:05,230
might well believe that you should be

00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,960
focusing on trade associations like the

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,540
Linux Foundation and OpenStack those are

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,860
organizations run for the benefit of the

00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,510
companies that are paying to be

00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:18,460
participants but open-source relies on

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,860
charities as well it relies on the

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:24,370
software freedom Conservancy it relies

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,230
on the FFF it relies on OSI we each have

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,420
distinctive and important roles to play

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,190
in creating the environment where the

00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,470
organization's in the first bullet are

00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,410
able to succeed and we need you to

00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:38,470
support us we need you to join we need

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,540
you to be active and to participate in

00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,550
the programs and campaigns that we have

00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,130
so please do that and please promote

00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,200
them with your employers please ask your

00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,030
employers to become sponsors of the OSI

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,580
or to become patrons of the free

00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,610
software foundation we need you to do

00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,050
that because in this decade I believe

00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,540
we're going to need to return to our

00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,240
services more than ever

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:03,450
so that's third decade lifestyle

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,250
cultures our contribution create them

00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:10,000
business models complex assembly of

00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,710
parts remember that to deal with

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,480
compliance you need to do more than make

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:16,090
an offer of source you need to

00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,820
accumulate details of who contributed if

00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,920
you're going to evade the future trolls

00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,490
you need to cherish software freedom and

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,080
put it at the heart of your thinking and

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,700
don't think that open is the answer

00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,040
software freedom is the answer

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,050
open is simply the marketing program to

00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,740
make your employer let you talk about it

00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:39,610
and cultivate charities as well as trade

00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,810
associations software freedom remains

00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:46,200
the essential core of software in the

00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:50,010
21st century projects that

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,720
seed will do open source right they will

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,670
do it in terms of giving freedom to

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,619
people and they will do it in terms of

00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,079
creating communities that are safe

00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,770
places for innovation and safe places

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,020
for socialization the future of

00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,900
open-source is actually the future of

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,119
software freedom software freedom is the

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,130
thing that we were set up to market and

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,880
software freedom is the key to our

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,109
success

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,310
so what unites us in whichever part of

00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:20,160
the movement we're in whether we're in

00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:23,250
the the the bsd movement whether we're

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,980
part of the open source OSI world

00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,630
whether a part of the FSF world the

00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,690
thing that unites all of us is software

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,950
freedom and we need to focus on that

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:34,079
because we're going to find that there

00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:37,200
are increasingly people who want to

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,119
divide us in whose interests it is to

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,089
say that open-source is just a word and

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,980
that free is just about money and those

00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:45,780
people are on the rise at the European

00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,609
Parliament and in the standards bodies

00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,790
once again

00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:54,780
the third decade of open-source also has

00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:56,490
a bit of a beard problem there's a lot

00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:01,020
of people who've been involved now for

00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:03,390
20 30 35 years and you know we're doing

00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,200
things like retiring and dying and

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:10,589
things and we need to pass our

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,990
experiences on participating in the

00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:16,680
community is not enough you need to be

00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:19,380
mentoring you need to be helping new

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,569
developers and also younger experienced

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,609
developers learn not to make the

00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:25,290
mistakes that you made if you didn't

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,880
make any mistakes you need to be helping

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,760
them to know how not to make the

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,859
mistakes you didn't make and I think

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,680
this is crucial for us to do as well

00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:37,160
pass on our experience to the people who

00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,970
are going to do in the next decade so

00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,520
with that I'd like to wish you a very

00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,670
happy birthday I wish I had the cake

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,619
Patrick didn't send us send us one so as

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,200
you raise a glass this evening please

00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,589
raise it to toast open-source software

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,589
freedom

00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:05,440
thank you very much for the talk and

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:12,700
there are a few minutes for Lester

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:20,890
questions and we have stickers it's a

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:23,319
question over there thank you thank you

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:27,069
very much for this enlightening talk

00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:34,150
as far as I understand software open

00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:37,240
source was created somehow in to refuse

00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:40,089
the freedom that reshef stylman proposed

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:47,710
to support would you say that 28

00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:50,290
afterwards you join his ideas so I would

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,040
say that that there were some people who

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,049
felt that way when I Sai was formed

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,589
however I would say yeah I put up a

00:44:56,049 --> 00:45:01,359
statement from Bruce Bruce's idea from

00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:03,240
the beginning was that open-source was a

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,950
marketing program for software freedom

00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,799
he fully embraced those ideals I

00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:10,420
embraced those ideals and I would say

00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:13,079
that the people who want to create a

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:19,690
distinct on our dinosaurs these days

00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:20,619
okay but right why Bob some will a fear

00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,809
in project here

00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:25,240
I was just wondering would you say that

00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:28,900
the defensive patent license is an

00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:36,040
effective an effective tool in our

00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:39,369
armory the defense of patent license is

00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,069
it going to be the GPL for patents or

00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:45,220
are we are we still lacking good tools

00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:47,440
there I think that we still lack really

00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:52,000
good tools for patents because the best

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:55,150
patent defenses the best patent defenses

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,319
are collaborative patent defenses so I'm

00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:01,450
a big fan of what oh I N and license on

00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,400
transfer network have tried to do both

00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:05,619
of them have tried to get patent holders

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,170
to create a disincentive for patent doc

00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,070
you and I believe that that is the key

00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,080
really is

00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,810
to to get people to collaborate together

00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,220
so to the extent that that DPL is a

00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,900
collaborative action I think it's a

00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,240
useful tool but I don't think we've

00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,950
worked out what the real solution for

00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,990
patents is beyond the reform of the

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,300
patent system and I've I've stopped

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:28,060
holding my breath about that in the

00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:33,730
light of the the single European patent

00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:37,830
which is unfortunately a train wreck all

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:44,469
right thank you thank you everybody

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:44,469
