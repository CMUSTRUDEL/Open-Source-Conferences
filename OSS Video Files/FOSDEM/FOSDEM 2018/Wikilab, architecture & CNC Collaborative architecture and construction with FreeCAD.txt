okay good evening everybody I'm Yorick

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,820
I'm one of the developers of the

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,430
freaking project this talk here is

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,220
mostly about one specific project that

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,640
I've been doing in Brazil with freak at

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,810
these this last year lots of people I

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,099
talked with asked for more they would

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,620
like to hear more about generically

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,760
about freecad so since we have quite a

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,950
lot of time we have like up to seven so

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
we have 40 minutes so I propose to go

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,960
quite fast with this like taking my 20

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,030
minutes like everybody else and then we

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,550
have more time to talk about freak ads

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,710
more generally you ask me question and I

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,840
will talk about more about freaking is

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,520
that okay for you right so this week lab

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:07,490
is the product I will be talking about

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:10,020
now it's basically yeah these slides are

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,390
that this is the product we've been

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,310
doing it's basically a community built

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,940
house it's not a house it's actually

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,830
used as free software laboratory by the

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,580
University where it's been it's been

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,560
built but it's the construction system

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,709
is also made to make anything else

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,720
houses of anything we just we happen to

00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:37,170
need a laboratory so that's what we

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,360
built and it's built these wooden system

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,759
is the wiki house system which is an

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,979
open-source building system made of wood

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,530
that is cut by CNC machines which are

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:56,610
robots that can cut piece out of

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,280
material and it's built by volunteers

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,349
it's extremely easy to build you see

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,229
that all these pieces have numbers and

00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:07,140
then and then you have a manual and only

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,289
tool that you need it you don't see it

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,439
but it's it's it's a hammer

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,909
it's a mmm rubber hammer and such

00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,950
basically the only tool you need to

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,950
build it there is no screw no glue no

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,410
anything else it's just hold together

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,900
because the system is really

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,849
well-thought that's all the joints are

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:36,310
made to become rigid so this is our

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:39,489
built building after all the work it's

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:47,459
been built over during about three

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:49,420
months this is the inside it's not 100%

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,239
finished you see that there are still a

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,959
lot of problems but it's basically there

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,709
and it's it's done this is how it

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,440
started being being built you begin to

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,690
build those structure that you see here

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,230
on the ground then you put them up and

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,420
then you put the parts that bend them

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:15,310
together I would explain all that a

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,390
little bit now later on and so we begin

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,209
to build like that this is the base wall

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,540
that we we didn't build at ourselves we

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,280
just hired a contractor a constructor to

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,069
build these parts that are more

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,630
traditional construction and that was

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:36,970
also one of the one part of the of the

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,090
experiments is to have a mixed system

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,329
with a part that's built by professional

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,099
builders in one part that's built with

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,260
volunteers and see how that could work

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,959
together how the experience of one could

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,349
help the other and that was another part

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,829
of the experience and that's the actual

00:03:53,349 --> 00:04:00,910
building with everybody like hammering

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,859
crazily and that's really the big part

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,750
of it if you look at the result the

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,540
result is not so impressive it's just a

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,970
little house but the the process of it

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,819
everybody there who build this thing

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,410
like went out of there saying this is

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:18,459
the best experience of my life I

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:21,099
actually built a house and the whole

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,220
point of the thing is actually to be

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:26,919
able to build your own thing not so much

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,140
that the result is so impressive or so

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,930
special but is the fact that you are

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,330
able to do it with no knowledge of

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,490
everybody was there like came there

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,950
without any experience and after one

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,590
hour you are professional you understood

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,360
the wall system and you can teach the

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:49,440
others how it works because you know

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:52,720
it's by heart and so this is after the

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,670
this is the first person who lived in

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,470
the in the house this is after after you

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,190
finish the structure you put the panels

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,310
on top of it and it's rigid normally it

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,050
doesn't need any more fixation or

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,170
anything we decide to put some screws

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,770
here to make stronger and because we're

00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,240
trying to make it last because most wiki

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,240
house based I will explain a bit more

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,030
about the wiki house afterwards but most

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,090
existing wiki house projects have been

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,250
built inside an exhibition for example

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,530
or though there was temporary things

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,990
that were dismounted after one week or

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,380
two weeks and now they are like I think

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,830
three or four that are built to last in

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,600
the world world so this is still

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,120
experimental we don't know how long it

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,810
will hold but we try to do our best to

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,440
make it last many years so we did a bit

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,050
more than just so that was a big problem

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,420
the construction was slow we had to

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,550
protect it from the from the rain and we

00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,940
didn't think well about that that was

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,930
one of the biggest problem we met then

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,750
since we are in Brazil we have very soft

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,020
climates basically you never have to

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,700
protect against cold or against heat

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,590
because we in southern parts of Brazil

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,780
where it's never too hot too hot and

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:22,360
never too cold so basically you can

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,790
forget about insulation and I will show

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,260
afterwards what they used to do in

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,260
Europe because wiki house project is

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,600
based it's from Europe so they have to

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,919
be really careful about insulation and

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,680
not letting any cold or any

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,139
humidity enter because humidity is

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,590
terrible for for the the wood it cannot

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,949
take water otherwise it begins to to rot

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,949
and to change shape and that's terrible

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,469
but in Brazil we don't have so much of a

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,590
problem because the the the air is

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:57,840
helping us instead of being an enemy so

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:03,029
what we decide to do instead of cladding

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,740
its inside skin is to let it breath so

00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:10,259
we used this material and we left a

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,389
space between it and and the wood so the

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:18,270
air could flow all the time and enter

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:20,370
below and escape on the top sewed the

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,370
air would flow all the time and keep the

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,029
wood dry all the time and this is

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:31,069
working quite well actually so it's all

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:34,110
opened on the sides the air can flow

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:35,639
between all the parts of the of the

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,729
structure because we don't have to care

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,279
much about being tight because it's not

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,830
important there if you have a bit of air

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,319
that goes in nobody cares it's even

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:50,550
better so we have a completely different

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,089
situation than than in Europe and we

00:07:50,550 --> 00:08:00,110
were able to experiment with these quite

00:07:54,089 --> 00:08:02,669
interesting air circulation systems and

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,509
you see the inside you see the details

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,669
of how the the joints are made and they

00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,849
are really tight that's the advantage of

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:15,210
having these wood piece cut by a machine

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:17,969
is that the precision is absolute so you

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,849
can actually dimension these things to

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,969
be just tight enough that you need a

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:28,319
hammer to put them in and once they are

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:30,469
in they are like very strong and so we

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,430
did a bit of testing to adjust the the

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:36,419
calibration of the machine but it was

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:40,919
like the first test was ok because like

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,579
the precision is building and so this is

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,470
what the machine does it's basically

00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:48,370
comes from your model that's where

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,410
freecad will enter in at what will

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,350
ever explain now basically your frequent

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,030
file goes to the machine more or less I

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,500
mean that the process is quite

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:04,150
straightforward and this is the pieces

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:09,820
being it's quite a lot of food this wall

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:13,630
house is like 107 tea pieces of woods

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,610
it's like two piles that size and when

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,650
it begins to accumulate like that you

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,990
really have a problem where to put them

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:25,570
before you use them and a little bit to

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,970
show you the details this is another

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:31,120
wiki house they've been building they're

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,400
finishing right now in alman in near

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,210
Amsterdam and there was a bit of

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,590
competition would finish is first and we

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:43,990
won and but it's ours much easier so

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,720
that's what why we won we don't have

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,360
half the complexity they had to to cope

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,430
with here but if you see it's exactly

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,940
the same system and exactly the same

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,590
shape and exactly the same problem so

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,610
this is the wiki house project that we

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:04,570
took our shape and our system from and

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,910
this is a system that was began in 2011

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:12,820
in by two architects in the United

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:15,520
Kingdom they built I think above 30 or

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,500
40 in the world world but those that are

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,520
still there that I were used to stay

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,380
it's about that there must be about four

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,230
or five now in the in the world world I

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,090
think two or three in the UK now we have

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,240
one in Brazil and there is this one in

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,560
our mail it's fully open source you can

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:39,490
just take their files and adapt like it

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:43,060
like if it was code just it's 3d models

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,640
and whole system of how you build it

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,360
they have manuals as well they have a

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,510
lot of resources outside just the files

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,920
and which are files as well but you

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:59,920
understood me and it's now well tested I

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,080
mean you see the first ones where there

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,620
were lots of defects in how the joints

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,050
would work

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,900
and the world thing would go like that

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,750
and over the years you have a lot of

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,050
people who worked on this even pretty

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,430
famous engineers and the system is now

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:20,580
extremely solid and these columns as we

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,680
call them destroy the main structures is

00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,480
really impressive once once you begin to

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,700
build them and the more you have like

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,770
three four five pieces crossing each

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,520
other and after the five pieces are

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:35,290
there it's extremely solid everybody

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,770
will look look at that and you can

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,410
really hang a lot of weight on them and

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,660
it's a heavy construction so it has a

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,920
lot of stability and it's really

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,740
something that you feel that it has

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,660
matured and it's become something really

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,520
you can trust this is the wiki house the

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,420
wall story of the wiki house project

00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,000
like you see the shapes being changing

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:12,730
over years the all the research that

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:16,090
went into finding the right shapes I

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,990
would say I would repeat the question is

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,780
why would would why are not they using

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,000
screws for example I would say there is

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,240
a kind of point they want to prove that

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,280
it's possible without any any other

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,000
materials and also the extreme

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,400
simplicity that you need your hands

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,530
basically to build it I find it's quite

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,470
impressive and you would have screwed it

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,540
we would begin to need more lots more

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,880
equipment and and there is something

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,670
incredible in the fact that you just

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:54,310
need your hands and a hammer and I kind

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:56,710
of like that and so we try to yeah you

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,680
need the machine okay okay okay but

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,490
let's say you have a part that's

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,500
production of the piece and then you

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,080
have a part that's building and the

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,150
building part is is you would separate

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,830
one from the other and then the building

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,589
paths like pure without any but that's

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,050
true

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,050
that's the kind of stuff you find on the

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:22,230
on the weekly house website you grab

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,529
their files it's basically all the old

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:28,350
ones are based on Sketchup those sketch

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:32,670
of files but they're not now migrating

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,649
to some scripting system for Reno so you

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,199
could enter the parameters and it would

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:41,610
build the 3d model automatically for you

00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:43,670
of course we try to port that to freak

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,309
out that's what's coming now

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,009
that's the kind of material you find

00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:52,920
there that's what we used basically

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,930
without modifying anything because we

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,550
want to try to not try anything fancy

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,370
and take the base system and try to do

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,350
it well and next time we'll try to

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,569
experiment some stuff but we really try

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,480
to do it the best way we could so we try

00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:11,670
to not to modify anything from it into

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,339
basically modular you make it as long as

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:20,309
you want it's just repetition of modules

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:24,180
in the in week house files you also find

00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:28,559
them already separated to be processes

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:31,589
to become files CNC files G code files

00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,939
to be used by the CNC machine so this is

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:38,660
all already set up but we redid that

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:41,959
part as well and then you have like

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:45,569
mounting manuals you see that they say

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:50,670
you could use you could use some truths

00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:54,059
and so this is freecad this is the

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,829
project I'm participating to since the

00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:01,319
project start in 2000 to have been there

00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:03,689
since 2008 I think yeah freak out for

00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:06,569
who doesn't know it it's basically a 3d

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:10,800
model and open for 3d modeler it's

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:12,990
algebra license and it's basically its

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,300
main focus that it's a technical

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,699
modeling application basically we used

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,019
to say it's used to build to model

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,519
things that you will build in the real

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,790
world afterwards so it's from electronic

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,040
components to cities

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,210
basically anything you would need to

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,170
build afterwards and you would need

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,960
precise modeling and control modeling

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,260
that you could do when we do afterwards

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,950
it's generic because it's that so that

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:46,760
our saying it's multi-purpose it's used

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,100
for any any kind of stuff and it's not

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,210
really specially for that kind of for

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:56,000
for buildings or for this or that a bit

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,760
like who knew AutoCAD that was a

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,310
strength of its AutoCAD was something

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,410
everybody used engineers hobbyist

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,180
architects everybody would use the same

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,660
software and it's something that has

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,120
been lost in the commercial world

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,430
because they want to specialize because

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,120
they want to sell best specific

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,520
solutions for each profession and we

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,140
like to like go back to the old good

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,690
times with free card and try to have

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,240
kind of application that's just a big

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:30,550
generic thing that you just wait for

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,260
your creativity to do to do work on it

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,270
and it's parametric that's a big feature

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,610
freecad that's all objects are defined

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,950
by the parameters it means like instead

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,480
of modeling cubes you would define an

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,310
object that for example that's a brick

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,850
wall and then you would say it has a

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,800
width length and height and then your

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,370
object is fine by these three parameters

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,130
and then you can change them afterwards

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,400
you change the length that the object

00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,760
changes its its length and everything is

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,890
driven by these parameters enter the

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,860
website of freecad that's free cut

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,500
basically it's pretty who doesn't know

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,210
it it's pretty common application like

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,170
you have a very standard QT based

00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:18,200
interface and a 3d view and modeling

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,040
tools it's really the interface has

00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:30,590
nothing special that's the kind of stuff

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:33,700
that people do with free CAD ways one he

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,770
did it this one

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,520
that's one of the last one that appeared

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:43,210
on the on the forum it people do quiet

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:48,190
kind of crazy stuff with with it more

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:50,290
and more and houses as well so one of

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,260
the first thing we did with this project

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:56,640
is convert the Sketchup stuff to two

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,230
freecad one of the main differences

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,780
Sketchup see is based on mesh geometry

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,610
which are basically points and triangles

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,310
everything is made of points and

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:10,150
triangles and infrequent we use bear up

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,280
geometry which is basically surface B

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,940
rep means boundary representation it

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:21,180
means that objects are defined by the

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:24,550
boundary surfaces and these surfaces are

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,110
basically NURBS surface like every edge

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,930
of the surface is a curve of

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,980
mathematical curve so you can basically

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:34,570
do anything that could be a curve

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,250
mathematical curve that means you have

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:44,110
extreme control of over exactly where

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:47,700
your your surfaces pass through it's a

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:51,370
bit the same analogy as bitmap and and

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,220
vector graphics like in vector graphics

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,580
you have the mathematical definitions on

00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,910
where the point if you zoom zoom closer

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,040
you still still see a perfect line and

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,930
in bitmap graphics there are pixels and

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,360
if you zoom very close you see the

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,300
pixels and it's the same thing mesh

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,660
geometry is like faceted you already

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,180
have the location of the points and with

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,730
variable geometry we can recalculate the

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:25,750
triangulation anytime so you don't have

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:30,430
any resolution in it so we took the

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:32,140
files from Sketchup converts them to we

00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,350
imported em in freecad then convert in

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,570
variable geometry and then the thing is

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,270
of course it's like Dom geometry where

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,760
each point of the object is already

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,930
fixed somewhere has a coordinate and we

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,700
need to do

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,230
turned we wanted to turn that into

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,510
parametric objects that you could like

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,330
stretch the world finger put more

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,380
modules or what if I put a window in it

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,070
or remove a window and have all that

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,820
interesting

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,400
parametric behavior and actually this is

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,560
something you don't need to do at once

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,250
you don't need to have the difference

00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,320
between parametric world and a word that

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,950
has no parameters at all you can start

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,980
with shapes with little parameters and

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,050
then add progressively more parameter

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,570
and next time you take the file and you

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,820
want to modify one of the objects you

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,860
had some parameters to be able to modify

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,800
them further and then you can really do

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,400
that step by step that's what we we did

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,050
and then we had all the integration with

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,290
other stuff that's not the wiki house

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:41,290
and then then the fun began is that you

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:46,900
begin to be able to produce a lot of

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:48,550
interesting stuff from your files so

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,250
that's basically what what happens you

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,640
take these Sketchup models which are

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,710
like dump objects and then you extract

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,570
the the contour of these shapes and

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,880
these become we become parameter

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,370
parametric in freecad you can put

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,380
dimension in this and say this must have

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,060
like 20 millimeters and then you have

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,100
parameters and then afterwards you can

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,020
change that to 30 if you want and you

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,620
don't need to redraw the shape it will

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,390
just go for do all this is really a

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,730
step-by-step work that you don't need to

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,820
do at once and then you can refine

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:24,370
refine refine over time this is the

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,160
finished model in infrakit with all the

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,290
rest it's not only the the wiki house

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,630
and you see what the of the good thing

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,000
is that you can organize that really

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,370
well the way you want and group the

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,500
objects by type and by and dude yeah of

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,410
course it's in Portuguese but just to

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,290
get to the idea that you can really go

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:47,020
into pretty complex models and keep

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:50,080
something that's really easy for human

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,510
to understand how its organized and

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,660
that's one of the big points I think

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,200
this is when you remove the stuff on top

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:03,690
of it it's really the

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:07,120
the wooden construction the inside and

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,570
all the piping is there everything is in

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,850
the model basically it's pretty complete

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:15,760
and so we had we had this model that the

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,460
wall building and we had another model

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,179
that's just one element and that's the

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,030
one we use to produce the files for the

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,110
CNC machine because it's basically seven

00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:32,010
of these modules so we did just one and

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,030
used the same output 77 times basically

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,520
and so it's pretty well organized

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,120
already from the wiki arts project you

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,650
have these side panels you have the

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,230
inner structure then you have the

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,690
reinforcement and then you have the side

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,780
plates everything is already like

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,360
defined and and separated in the wiki

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,970
house project you just have to like

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:59,320
understand how it works and it's really

00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:03,700
amazingly amazingly well well done this

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,530
is what when the producing with it all

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,400
these things that I will show now that

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:11,620
you need to have and of course the most

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,750
beautiful thing of using a free software

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,140
to do that kind of experimental stuff is

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,110
that you end up coding because you you

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,570
end up adapting for the special case and

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,580
so we had quite a lot of new free ket

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,570
codes being done

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:30,010
thanks to this this project as well

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:33,429
that's the kind of 2d plans that you

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,679
need to get the authorization to build

00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:38,559
the thing you have to in our case we're

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,570
on University grounds we had to ask for

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,860
authorization to all the University

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,020
instance and and stuff that was the

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,330
worst part of the whole thing is to be

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,030
able to obtain all those authorization

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,900
so you need these drawings to be able to

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:59,140
show them renderings to this is one of

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,710
the this project was financed by a

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,740
crowdfunding campaign and this is one of

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,780
the image we had to produce to show that

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,400
how it would be when it would be

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,980
finished to make people want to

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,110
contribute to the the project

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:18,330
we'll be afterwards like a call for

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:23,100
artists to propose drawings to to be

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,100
painted on top of it that's not done yet

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:32,010
know that you export the sort of thing

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,900
you would yeah actually explain this

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:38,700
worsley basically produced by free card

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,679
with a little bit of rework in Inkscape

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,480
afterwards because some things are still

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,940
easier to do in scape to put this text

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,650
that are not in freecad this one

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,140
basically is the freaking model that you

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,710
saw so it's just an earlier version it

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,570
was exported in blender and a couple of

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,530
texture lights put in blender and

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,480
rendered in blender which renders

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:05,770
distance between two that we trying to

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,440
reduce and the idea was talking the

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,049
other day with the tonal hosen dolphin

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,179
blender is to be able to have like a one

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,429
button you would pushing in free cotton

00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:19,240
it would like land in blender with a

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:22,600
preset of lights already you would like

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,360
have almost a one button render and he's

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,960
really interested in developing in this

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,320
further so we should be able for the

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,299
next time to reduce that distance that

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,799
you need to produce a nice render and

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,500
you have other solutions as well that

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,080
beacon becomes becoming real-time

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,809
rendering it etc becoming interesting to

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,370
use together with free cab that you

00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,500
could have all the modeling in free card

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:51,520
and just export some other application

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,470
to do the final image these precious

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,860
that's one of the biggest Vantage of

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,480
having a sound model of your your

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,900
building is that all the quantities are

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,390
there how much would we need exactly how

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,750
how many square meter of wood would I

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,030
need how many bricks I would need are

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:15,370
there and then once you have that

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:17,110
putting prices on this is pretty easy in

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:21,460
Brasilia we have we are lucky enough to

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,500
have several public sources of prices

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,570
for the construction that are maintained

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,880
by federal governments

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:31,120
like they take all the the public works

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,210
they do and they they extract from that

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,040
the price the median price of one square

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,220
meter of brick wall one square meter of

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,990
floor and so it's when you can its

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,760
public you can use that for your own

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,670
project and it's basically the same

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,950
price that you will find the day you

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,170
will build it so you if you have the

00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,360
right quantities you have a really

00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,830
precise estimation of the price the

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,820
final price of the building

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:59,290
that's what we use to to estimate how

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,800
much money we would need for the

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:09,870
crowdfunding and it turned up to be

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:14,020
exactly what we we spent which is around

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:16,870
fifteen thousand year sixty thousand

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:23,890
Brazil real it's about four no it's yeah

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:27,280
fifteen thousand euro including

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:30,700
everything there is like a fee of the

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,400
crowdfunding platform that's about seven

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,560
percent if I remember correctly then

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,110
there is the price of the wood there is

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,080
the price of the cutting of the wood

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:45,070
because it's a it's firm a company that

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:49,890
did the cut and the price of the the guy

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:54,660
who did all the brick works and and so

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,650
yes everything was made locally but like

00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:05,020
hundred meters from from the

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:07,630
Construction Yard 15 one five yeah and

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:10,390
this is this price is about the same

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:15,460
price that you would spend for a brick

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:18,070
house of the same size in Brazil but it

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,630
could be reduced a lot big part of this

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:24,250
price went to the company did the cut

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,610
and if you imagine that you would build

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:30,460
several of those houses and that you

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,650
could have a machine that you could

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,590
operate with the same volunteers that

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,120
built you could reduce that price

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,430
crazily so this is

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,890
this could be even reduced Lots if you

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:52,750
begin to think on a bigger scale or know

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:58,150
more community-based planning but maybe

00:28:52,750 --> 00:29:00,670
but all yes you could every bid that the

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:03,070
the Builder who did was we're looking at

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,800
that and I think you guys are using

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:09,490
crazy lot of wood this could be done

00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:12,309
with like half the wood and yes but then

00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:16,630
you'd need more experienced people to do

00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:21,820
it and it changed and I think that there

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:23,980
is kind of pedagogical that you can

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,160
build your own house and you don't need

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:31,210
to be especially you need motivated

00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:33,370
people to to to do all the manual work

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,630
you can do it release in a simple way

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:39,190
and this is this project has this crazy

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,540
capacity to show people that is really

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,540
simple yeah

00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:11,779
yes only that this is a really hard

00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:13,460
system to calculate because you wouldn't

00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:18,200
have any software that is able to

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:24,169
calculate this kind of so many joints

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:26,179
and have a precise result and the effort

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,809
in all those things is really complex

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:33,109
and I believe this system where you

00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:35,019
cannot have at this moment official

00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:37,460
calculation of it you have several

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:39,649
important of well-known engineers that

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:44,419
worked on the system including a loop

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:46,669
which is maybe the most famous engineers

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:48,979
office in the world world they're based

00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,940
in the UK and built in the world world

00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:56,149
and they worked on this and so you have

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,559
lots of famous people lots of Engineers

00:30:56,149 --> 00:31:01,609
work on this system and it all goes

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,549
pretty much together with

00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:07,219
experimentation and each generation of

00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:10,460
this how that goes further you begin to

00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:12,619
know that they see it in the you begin

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,570
to know its I would say it's a common

00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:17,119
knowledge that goes building together

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,219
with with the building but that believe

00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,219
it's really hard to calculate beforehand

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:36,470
yes yes no it's a CNC machine with with

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:40,010
a cutting head that's basically like a

00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,950
drill machine it's a little head that

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,690
goes you put the plate that the wooden

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:51,500
plate on the machine and this machine

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,890
goes cutting this thing yeah that is

00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,490
true

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,890
but we had a hard time finding we didn't

00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:01,700
find a big enough of these machines

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:03,470
around the Construction Yard and there

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,360
must be like a couple of them in some

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:10,370
parallel which is where we were building

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,350
and this one was really convenient and

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,990
it was close it was people from inside

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:19,700
the the open-source community it was

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:23,060
much better to go with them because of

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:25,760
all the circumstance and so we like

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,340
stopped looking after other possible

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,260
solutions probably the laser cuts you

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,360
would have like two firms in some part

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:39,580
would do it they would charge a lot more

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:44,810
and this might have made things go wrong

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:46,460
this is basically the kind of file that

00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,430
you get from your penance one you have

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,890
once you have all your 3d models these

00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,410
red lines are the it's the g-code is

00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:58,070
basically the path that the machine must

00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:01,610
the head of the machine must walk on the

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:07,130
piste to to carve it like that it must

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:10,370
go up go down and do the shapes this

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,320
basic J code it's the language that most

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,930
of the cutting machines in the world

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,110
even the 3d printers use and they have

00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:20,860
each machine vendor has a different

00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,790
dialect so you have like to do

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,960
adaptations in depending on the machine

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:32,210
bus it's basically the same the same

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:35,510
system in our case we weren't able last

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:38,130
year in the half of last year to do it

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,280
all infrakit so basically what we

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:44,340
did is export these to the ships of

00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,290
every piece of the model and then the

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,550
shop where we did the cut they did the

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:53,070
g-code from from these from these fights

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:55,110
because it was like eight months ago and

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,400
lots have been done since then in

00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,670
freaked out that wasn't there at that

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,380
time and we had to produce it and it

00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,990
wasn't there so we did it that way but

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:10,560
now so that's the kind of fights that

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:12,030
was produced from from these files now

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,409
we would be able to do it to the freak

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:17,970
out if we had to do it today

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:21,450
everything is there to make these decode

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:25,820
and export it directly to a file that is

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,820
ready to send to the Machine basically

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:33,659
it's computers you still have to for

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:40,560
example you take this face and you have

00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:44,010
let me show you the path module it's in

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,740
the next slide but we have now a lot of

00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,840
tools to take one piece take the driver

00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,710
face of it and then it would calculate

00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,600
all paths automatically so that's all

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,000
the work that has been basically done

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,580
last year it there has been a lot of

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,710
work on that CNC part and now it's

00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,280
totally possible to take all your panels

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:06,090
and from each one generates

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,490
automatically a patent you have lots of

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,290
options if the holes have to go before

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,750
the external profile if you have to

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,240
change the order and that kind of stuff

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,160
it's really becoming becoming whole

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,030
that's another tool that we have been

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,600
working on because of this project is a

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:29,610
way to gather a lot of piece and join

00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:32,850
them in a special in defined area which

00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:36,240
would be your base wooden material and

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:41,340
to try to lose as little material as

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:47,520
possible this is done automatically this

00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:49,950
is yeah this interface is basically what

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,930
you use that's the new tool nesting tool

00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,870
you define the container you are

00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,590
shapes in eatin and it's still pretty

00:35:54,870 --> 00:36:01,620
slow because new and not very much

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,200
optimized so it runs like half an hour

00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,480
for something like that but that will

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:12,060
get better over time we need to optimize

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:15,300
it but it basically works that's the the

00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,450
new password' bench you see that we have

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:22,290
quite a lot of tools already basically

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:24,690
now it works pretty much like you define

00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,790
a project cutting projects does the

00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,490
interface here you define your basement

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:33,090
the size of your base material where is

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:36,770
the start point of your the head of your

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:40,020
machine and then it goes fill this up

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:42,900
this is a typical path job and so you

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,990
have a lot of setup to do but then you

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,700
just add stuff add operations one after

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:56,550
the other and the machine will do one

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:59,820
after the other at the moment it works

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:03,210
only for cutting because most of the

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,580
people that worked on this are doing for

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:09,360
cutting but it's exactly the same

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,730
language that goes for 20 printer only

00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,490
the thinking is different because you're

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,740
not cutting you are adding materials so

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,820
probably we will need to think a bit

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,740
about it

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,530
maybe some operations need to be thought

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,200
the other way but the world process and

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,870
the file that goes out out of this

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,090
should be the same I mean all the big

00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,980
part the hard part is is done it would

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,070
be probably a matter of testing and

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,070
trying to find what what needs to be

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,070
inverted

00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:51,490
it's being worked on there is already a

00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:53,440
lot of lots done like one month ago

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,529
there were there were like a big change

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,829
that in in the order of the you know you

00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:02,349
do first the contour then you do each

00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:04,480
each hole and some guy calls something

00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:06,970
to calculate the distance between the

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,730
hole and to reduce that crazily because

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,859
it was like dawn but by its position and

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,559
now it's dawn by the distance between

00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:16,509
the holes and so you have a lot of

00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,960
possible optimization to do and it's

00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:22,869
it's a long-term work actually - - but

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,809
it's it's totally being being done right

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:29,140
now actually this is the kind of

00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:32,710
settings that you put on each each

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:35,680
operation that's in your job this is the

00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,390
property of each tool you can you have

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,400
some machines that have several tools so

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:43,990
you can change and saying you define

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,990
them here so that the the if the program

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:50,519
knows the diameter it will know where

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:53,650
the path must must go like if you have a

00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:56,380
one centimeter tool you need to pass

00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:59,529
your line at half a centimeter from the

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,789
border so the border of the tool will be

00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:02,789
exactly on the line that you want

00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,700
exactly not yet but it's

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,430
you

00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,330
on here which line it is it's getting

00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,340
really interesting to work with and then

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,710
at the end you select one of those

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,660
post-processor which will convert the

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,810
the generic G code that we use in

00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,150
freecad to a specific machine at the

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,880
moment there are like five or six that

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:53,820
work well and the linuxcnc is one of the

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,030
most well known controller for this

00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,770
machine it does the one that's mostly

00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,760
used that's the kind of machine that

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:06,119
does the work and basically this is what

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,170
we learned from the the world experience

00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,060
this project that it's really easy to

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,830
fabricate the architects but I'm an

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,380
active by trade I'm not a programmer I

00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:19,200
went into this like buy my own but

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,660
architects are not used to touch the

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,780
fabrication then just buy stuff that's

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,790
existing and it's totally a new new area

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,240
that we can enter by using this kind of

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,860
hybrid space between fabrication and

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,340
architecture and there is a wall word

00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:38,340
that's not really much explored and that

00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:41,820
it's much easier than what us architects

00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:44,880
would think most of us would think and

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:50,250
cost control becomes very precise

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:56,220
because you have a lot of a lot of data

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:58,520
to work with and yeah I won't read all

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,680
that stuff but there is a lot of

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:06,020
experimentation and learning to come

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,020
from from this

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,510
