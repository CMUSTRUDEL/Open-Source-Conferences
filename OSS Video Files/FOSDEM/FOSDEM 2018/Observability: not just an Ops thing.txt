[Music]

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:37,649
the contractor service put you to - the

00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:43,799
red team so we're in the center and

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:46,159
should be working to provide for years

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,950
people have been talking about the devil

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,890
teaching

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,890
automate their work that's cool

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:06,140
protection ops death or teaching others

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:10,539
to production comfortable sticking

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,539
around asking questions treat infectious

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,080
and IQ codes back observability is that

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,510
bridge the sustain that helps developers

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,970
go from understanding other codes on

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,720
their machines to understand how

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,330
bidentated

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,410
production observability is all about

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,470
answer sessions record system decide

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:38,120
holistically and that abilities a

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,549
sizeable numbers of people running

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:48,170
testing the code either this with the

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:50,660
operators deploying so that all the

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,180
people here are monitoring observability

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,950
they think monitoring it off and that's

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,750
certainly the part of that it's true or

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,410
else I call you kind of cycle harder to

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,959
gain the screw and some of the tools and

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:06,590
resources of things I focus on officer

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,690
consent so what if it was cool what if

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,790
these these techniques bill the language

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,220
that developers are already using and

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:18,560
thinking about my customer IDs

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,040
what looks part of so major you're

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,599
telling me that latency that word is

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,090
funny and I you know

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,010
it what kind of service what time is guy

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,200
what will tie my coat is they affected

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:37,840
or related another a recurrent

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:48,370
characteristic right when went off

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:53,200
what does throat over two years up what

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,209
does winning builders use why probably

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,190
nice way to probably reduce the problems

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:10,329
that I think the more we bridge this gap

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:12,609
is with more obscene by talking about

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,319
what productions it's not about some

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,870
officer standard stuff but what is

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:25,020
having a correction but more than that

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:25,020
also insurance possibility these days

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,740
there's all these great practices right

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,040
because I thought architecture reviews

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,470
TV more tests could have beauty I a TV

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,639
and then you shipping celebrates really

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,620
awesome I could have done that week we

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,350
for customer service a few Tigers to

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,630
tell us what happened like diligence

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:59,510
curiosity up front we're gonna go make

00:04:50,630 --> 00:05:03,160
sure these things are covered well we

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,160
know what it's a lot easier to isolate

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,590
but during development process we've got

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,050
all these questions better system

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,430
I don't smell like correction whatever

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,870
but Cipollini hexerin production and

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,360
they're not all problems are knowledge

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,340
but how oft they exactly to pop up on

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,520
our own instead they're not

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,080
hypotheticals they're about to the

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,090
customer segments right what what

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,039
happens if I make this change the code

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:42,020
by optimize this over here will actually

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:46,099
be often this question is even dressed

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,780
what is many right oh this is what's

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,120
happening I think this will bit better

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,229
thank you sure we sure that this is what

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,639
we're seeing

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:54,639
well this is just what

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,260
by nature and powered leverage

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,930
production data to explore references

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,250
that are doing we can't have that not

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,210
only inform what we're building

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:17,669
or fixing but how about those

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:20,310
Scopus how to make sure it's working so

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,930
here's some you know very traditional

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,850
standard production systems oscillations

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:31,680
very much to turn them into things that

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:34,290
I think about think about things that

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,530
affect the business things that are

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,060
relevant for users yeah should be only

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,940
many production you're not going to be

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,550
able to simulate these on your laptop

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:52,910
without going looking what is happening

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:52,910
what motivates our tests are only a good

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:03,219
benchmarks contain a run and are

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,889
isolated or stay in college acceptance

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,689
under that sometimes must retry

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,659
exceptional Decatur doesn't always

00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,639
result for exceptions so what can we do

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:16,479
is extend new great practices that would

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:28,330
have development into production

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:37,960
you can't wait for customers opportunity

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:42,879
to some taking initiative to stay mental

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:46,389
disability introduction exciting stories

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,039
y'all this is week

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,520
she was software engineer on small team

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,310
and that's where main house she's been

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,099
tasked to improve how thirteen of what

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,550
Reagan's so till now are able essence we

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:03,520
can process cash Walter Joseph strength

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,150
we research for trying to no postulate

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,150
the breakaway

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,870
well those works well enough spent that

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,850
attitude to the screw the kind of

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,830
uncomfortable correlation between well

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,690
more the customers who kind of have to

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,060
go here at the live downstairs have an

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,850
off day and I never made a little more

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,680
connection so this point it's time to

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:34,110
spit up a chair cash create a

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,909
perspective but just making the change

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:44,350
even like okay I would be careful about

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:47,560
changing your customers seems like the

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,900
best so she wants to know what they're

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,510
together to build comment that is great

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:56,200
when all their own work correctly and

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,390
not screw over too many customers but

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,850
bringing it into decision making process

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,060
should stimulate change let's do the

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,060
same

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:16,209
so did she

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,250
a long time in wavelength or request

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:21,610
shows under debate the track whether it

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,730
would be whether it would be rid of the

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,740
book I just like her makes me visualize

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:33,209
okay this is what's currently happening

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,510
granny world could as many get this

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:39,070
and she sees cool Maybelline on with

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,430
them afterwards tripped in a couple

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,800
places

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,070
desolation that's what that's what we

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,370
expect and Sheamus Kiev were able to

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,070
actually examine each case individually

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,500
to assess hey this customer this use

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,130
case

00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,060
yeah like taking these test cases out of

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,060
torment

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,759
what's this double my machine right

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:18,990
disabilities well I mean obviously

00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:22,160
butterflies do want to stop without the

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,129
record customers but that's what we do

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,930
that's what she was how she got all the

00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:33,350
data through slide these are line above

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,540
statements they're lightweight

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,660
Helmuth value it is hot seats incurred

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:49,499
motivators for the business and describe

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:52,470
the execution of our alright so this is

00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:55,529
being slowed up Scotty like statements

00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:13,379
in the pocket that trying to do a little

00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:16,019
more now all she witnessed or later what

00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:20,839
you know is notice that it's something

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:24,899
that impacts multi customers a lot but

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,660
else but it's a very common sense of

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:35,930
common systems just

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:40,300
they change they sure about it all

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:44,360
existing Tesla cronies past and present

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:52,100
as well but it earlier we talked about

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,810
penguin connection is a cluster now

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,959
that's all the speaker that you over

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,120
this stuff with the local Texas right

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,880
it's controlled state environment where

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,610
it can construct execute tasks but the

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,170
key to the same impression using things

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:15,800
like find a test like that that's here

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:19,870
is ability to switch the trace but you

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,600
do whatever code like her nothing you go

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,089
a couple machines she was able to

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,660
compare in couple performance metrics

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:39,080
anything normally turn about but able to

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:43,279
compare the comments when you start that

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:48,339
are increased 10% and 20% rest assured

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,339
all while keeping a close eye on

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:58,720
to the server over and said future

00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:00,370
clients like a sweater and remembering

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,830
and being able to incorporate them into

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,070
our excitability gives us the ability to

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:09,970
find these ephemeral segments are code

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:14,310
to enter these ephemeral questions they

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,310
aware that dollars can work there

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:23,749
sometimes though even with the best

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:27,480
intentions we managed to Lee's code or

00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:29,790
the question that always comes up you

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,369
don't reaction from customer report when

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,990
did this start happening not necessarily

00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:36,689
because they're simple concerned about

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,119
you know the black tiger alive and that

00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:43,259
was performed to mostly that that's just

00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:45,149
the that was wait that back to page what

00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:50,809
makes will pull requests when you come

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:55,949
under an attack any other schools okay

00:14:50,809 --> 00:15:02,540
thank you system usually came in pushing

00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:03,660
code so he got tired of this uh

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,999
backwards

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,689
timeline down about where they're just

00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:11,040
about time for dinner we're doing

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,809
something that to me that helped her to

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,439
convert this code whether this bill when

00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:18,720
she comes new takes on the ground and

00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:21,660
once she got that going this highest

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,230
single a high signal peace ability of

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,990
their whole food system she could

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:31,350
immediately go from this this something

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,850
that that goes from hey everybody

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,189
highlight around this time not really

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:38,899
sure that we should find out happening

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:38,899
to to go ahead

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,310
by making her observability tools talk

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,460
about my system and that she dealt with

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,670
today

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,090
should we go from this question mark

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,700
celebrate and be part of the process to

00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,530
start filling in a collection to start

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,170
thinking about the technique reduction

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:06,660
to thinking about investigating

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:09,460
outliners result adult reserved options

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,940
and to move second the initiative and

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:21,550
exploring connection book with my poems

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:24,160
and I think that's how we bridge this

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,230
oxygen developer gap that's what we

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,590
start engineers like he start thinking

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:33,070
my weapons activation instrumentation

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:38,110
monitoring not just things throwing

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:40,480
again ok everyone we're all afraid to go

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:48,190
she swindled it and continually checked

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:49,690
even interfere health impact by

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,870
capturing the new one lightweight

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,420
transgenerational card for the switch

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,700
and shut the code everyone can make

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,840
better informed decisions deliver very

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,840
experienced users

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,419
nobody can have this departure rather

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:27,020
than just right to write your plan

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:30,559
isolation like hey I have a great idea

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,890
for my composition which might say it is

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,890
great

00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:40,039
what are we just cut out like come a

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,620
time where we spend much time writing

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,960
code for that it was the dolly I have to

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,500
see then make sure we're doing the right

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,770
thing inspect our time where matters

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,409
all right great well cool how do we get

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:58,370
there what is what is what can we have

00:17:54,409 --> 00:18:02,260
to walk away with a whole new big stuff

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:12,730
well you should talk a little bit later

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:12,730
we'll cover the ground but we're just

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:20,390
capturing something every HTTP request

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,280
for every HTTP server pattern is woven

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:28,990
and I'll make bail which end point which

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:33,799
method which along with the rest of you

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:36,419
this is great for things like

00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,369
they were playing with carefully make

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:41,599
this changed right API over here they

00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:47,069
were actually doing it or is it just all

00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:49,319
marriage how this Standish request that

00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:51,089
the south with starts trembling in some

00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,379
the development identified occurs right

00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:55,429
these things that actually are

00:18:52,379 --> 00:19:00,209
descriptive of what the custom workflow

00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,559
about what the workload looks like as

00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:04,049
well many infrastructures into the

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,199
characteristics competitions I you

00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:09,989
really got the right to do with that all

00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:12,149
that further you know at some point

00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:13,769
we're gonna be looking at that something

00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:15,389
strange and it won't break it down we

00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:21,689
want to find out it's not one

00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:24,029
millisecond and its first to really set

00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:28,249
you up for some ad hoc the federal

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:30,859
curves that you saw this new series

00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:33,770
myself asking you questions

00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:38,120
hey let's change

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:45,250
like that are defined then by yourself

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:56,180
ready set up to necessary for magnetic

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:58,910
4/3 after change both of those examples

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:08,510
we saw earlier the reason an example of

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:10,220
a searched an example but it's so simple

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,460
you make it simple enough to get easier

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:29,110
after the developers have you think why

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:38,090
normally be powered able to value series

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:41,140
especially things that really keep keep

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,140
getting easier there with

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:50,690
a wage read any this things are you're

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,280
very conservative thinking up its

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,050
whatever actually to have all the way

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:59,690
that's characterized

00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:00,620
think about this data a concert down to

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,110
disappearing

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,210
I can't tell you how many and they folks

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:09,050
we've worked with who have ended up with

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:16,370
a set of logs where it's so much and

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:23,840
some systems might need some help

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:26,990
future news not capacity and again like

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,210
India look at what you need but no we're

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:34,010
developers look at what makes sensory

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:38,870
system right say you have a service

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:45,820
where about redeploy oh man I really

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,820
need to learn this about my sister like

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,610
shake these requests but everything we

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,300
request but you go in later and slice

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,640
dice of a look at okay request I have

00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,690
this real these characteristics

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:09,830
I think about these about Southern women

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:11,060
I'm gonna have optimized for crap out of

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,530
the right path

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,180
I preferred path even in cases where

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,570
your expectation libraries super

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,210
optimized to the lower hood you still

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:26,860
probably want to be sensitive to report

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:37,070
be careful that hugger one thing I don't

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:42,310
additional for every break again this

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:42,310
requires those building expectations

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:59,750
rich and because books what if I

00:22:50,030 --> 00:23:05,680
practice this is what guys like it's

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:09,490
very simple high level three children

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:31,730
and then we started anything Tigers

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:35,620
starting started to 13 that were right

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:45,880
who you think that work useful but we

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:48,880
wanted to continue building on because

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
more

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:58,350
first recycle of the more reviews or

00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:02,440
Washington want more bills work country

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,140
so in conclusion yeah those are tools

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,910
you use so long after thinking about how

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,810
do you incorporate into some production

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:13,840
data into their develop process

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:17,250
big or small I think Lionel every group

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,320
the books for involved shipping software

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:25,810
building software should understand

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:27,880
behavior of what the software does some

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,070
the developers should be voting

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,460
observability because we have the most

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:37,230
to gain observability should be a core

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,230
part that's how they decide what to do

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:49,600
or were like cool we're pregnant

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,270
we have the carmaker users happier

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,790
building better software by making our

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,820
suitability tools reflect upon reality

00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,710
but Albert's women the ladies feature

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,730
five customer rating is like things

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:07,710
things that are not just positive to you

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,710
the rings we know about our change

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:15,470
by the way on the stories that I told

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,470
