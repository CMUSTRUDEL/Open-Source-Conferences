okay maybe a little bit of a panic I

00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:12,590
like a love level so both metrics and

00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,310
lofts are time-based and when we first

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,139
edition and we wanted the solution

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,200
aggregate of the mideast data through

00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:23,240
central location and today need to add

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,029
additional makin a balanced tags and

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,539
labels simulator both it is sensitive to

00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,539
the Sun

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,330
one of the nurses

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,730
most commonly Skiba for alerting we have

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,620
committees the capacitance Sentinel and

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,110
ocular for last research so what we

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,630
wanted to achieve in having both metrics

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,390
and off limits one summation less

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,120
maintenance less upgrades less comfort a

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,630
component that you need support then

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,550
this is very important for us an

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,220
additional family the project when we

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,750
combine ranks along c1 solution is that

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,510
you can correlate between them

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,550
so if you have an error in your loss you

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,250
want to understand what's going on you

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,430
can go and see the dashboard in one way

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,220
or you can see that in that time your

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,570
disk is flowing that post that

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,840
specifically this can pinpoint your

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:30,690
issues real time when they designed it

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,880
this the forest at the last extension to

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,260
be nice graphic and it looks different

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:41,160
the main issue first first point which

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,920
is very important to counter each of the

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,790
different equations and then we wanted

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,530
to have blocks and metrics or support a

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,790
flexible schema a long-term storage and

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,790
being able to store the water

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,270
for large environments so for the over

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,670
point of what we chose for the money

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,850
talk for them the collectors for the

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,480
metrics which was plenty including

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:17,180
before locks & gabbana

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,880
for graphical visualization and to that

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,400
sort of analysis they were alerted is

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,430
still to be decided

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,650
so whatever you take out of this

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,800
presentation is that having both mention

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:35,600
of the one summation is less maintenance

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,480
a lot more when you have one solution we

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,270
need to have less maintenance and less

00:04:38,480 --> 00:05:03,070
updates as I said before you get a value

00:04:41,270 --> 00:05:03,070
