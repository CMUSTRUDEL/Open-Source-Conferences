	00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:13,820
okay thank you I sincerely hope that you

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,520
can hear me in the last rows because I'm

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,279
coming from the warm weather of Rome and

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,510
here in Brussels already made some a

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,939
little bit of damage to Scott but

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,230
anyways if you cannot hear me please

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,780
raise your hands

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:32,899
I hope so yeah yeah this is the thing it

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,309
has a green light so I really hope it's

00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:40,760
a good indication that it probably was

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:43,190
working so city of Bologna 2015 yeah a

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,839
lot of road construction works and of

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,909
course just like in with the any road

00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,760
construction site it attracts a lot of

00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:52,789
people a lot of people who just go there

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,979
and try to see and see if the if the

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,319
road is being done correctly just like

00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,760
they used to do in their times and it's

00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,350
such a popular phenomenon I guess not

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,239
just in Bologna and not just in Italy

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,159
but all around the world but we have

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,860
created this world which is called a

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,780
morel and over L means exactly this is

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,470
the person it's a little man and it's

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,740
the person usually of old age who goes

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,260
and checks the work and to give you a

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,290
couple of facts about Omer s eleven

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,030
thousand euros this is the budget that

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,970
the city of rich owner just goes to

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,220
Bologna are located yearly to pay a

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,540
steep into this Umarov because they do

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,550
provide a useful service to the

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,820
administration did you provide an the

00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,410
serve as a double check to me to ensure

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,590
that the public works are carried out

00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,450
not in a good way and this guy here was

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,960
the first one to be a word at the price

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,940
of a morale of the Year 2015

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,190
Franco there was a nice celebration

00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,070
where the vice major gave this award and

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,920
nominated him head of the world

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,090
construction site for one day but to

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,090
introduce you know somebody who is

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,030
definitely not a numeral don't say I

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,760
ever made this metaphor is my boss

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:09,019
Diego passion tini so we take opium tini

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,560
he was the senior vice-president of

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:15,620
Amazon and he took a two years leave to

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,060
be tasked with the job of digitizing and

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,609
modernizing Italy it was named

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,090
Commissioner for Digital Agenda so what

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,940
did he do

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,840
form the team team of 30 super experts

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,690
at as the the press would define them

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,810
and try to tackle this in men's job and

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,160
130 seems like a medium to large agency

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,680
well if you put all of us in the same

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,040
room or in the same slide it's not that

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,220
many people so in order to tackle this

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,340
enormous task we set up some plans and

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,390
they go so to be effective we need to be

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,930
we need to work on the infrastructure we

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,980
need to be plumbers what do I mean by

00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,560
this I mean just like a plumber has made

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,870
mixes on job in your own house or in a

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,799
building you will only know about the

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,110
job that he did where or she did when it

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,730
was done not properly otherwise it's

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,700
hidden it's in the foundation is in the

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,000
infrastructure and just like any good

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,980
plumber at the beginning he started to

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,799
ride with the team at the three-year

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,500
plan it's all to lay down the plans for

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,959
what they would do in this in this

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,519
program and well it's a rather big

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,739
document which is also translated into

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,329
English but it's about 150 pages so I'm

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,980
not going to explain the whole plan to

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,010
you right now I'm just going to give you

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,329
a very quick glimpse well the first

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,190
thing that was defined was the

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,069
technology of course the technological

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,530
platforms and infrastructure the second

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,370
part was about the processes defining

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,220
processes and the third one were to

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,980
decide tools that would embody those

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,380
processes the word decided and this is

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,269
exactly where openness and hack ability

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,340
comes in because of course technology is

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:05,450
an enabling factor you need to have

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,130
enabling platforms which allow you to to

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,769
build something so it needs to be

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,349
generic it needs to be API based etc but

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,459
the real the real key the one with the

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,230
message that I want to explain to you

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,680
today goes into these two levels the

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,510
processes and the tools to give you an

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,280
idea about the technologies well this is

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,430
a very very quick summary but basically

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,200
we created we created or we have to to

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,159
to build projects that were already

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,619
ongoing about the identity so

00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:36,009
digital identity online offline on your

00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:37,449
ID card used with standard chipsets so

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,159
you can build an open ecosystems around

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,409
it or dine a graphical information

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,199
centralized so you have API as you can

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,439
integrate better applications then a

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,389
second big chapter was made on platforms

00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,309
such as the payment platforms or an API

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:56,769
ecosystem where you have this pretty

00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:58,629
radical shift of no longer having a

00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:01,089
service being given to the users but

00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:03,490
starting from a set of API so that it

00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,439
can be integrated and the machines also

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,999
in the public in the 12,000 public

00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,099
administration that we have easily can

00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:11,949
talk to each other and then of course a

00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,749
data and analytics framework so that you

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,469
can properly make use of all the big

00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:19,360
data we are producing and of course all

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,309
these technologies are great but if we

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,119
keep developing them the usual way then

00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:31,689
we keep being in a real garden so how do

00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:34,479
we create the open processes luckily for

00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:36,849
us we have the ready head start we had

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,819
this digital administration code which

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,009
is a pretty pretty advanced code in as

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,800
far as logos and and this was the effort

00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:48,490
that was put in place before we arrived

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,990
in order to open up the processes and to

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,909
sum up the articles there are two very

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,729
nice articles which article 68 which

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:57,279
says that old public administration have

00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:01,029
to choose open source solutions first

00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,709
and that all new code that is created

00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,499
for public administration should be

00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:09,129
openly licensed but of course this is

00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:10,869
not enough I mean sure having a good low

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,789
having a good framework is absolutely

00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,349
essential otherwise you don't have the

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,069
freedom to implement new policies and

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:19,869
new processes but good tools are as well

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,669
because if you know if you just provide

00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:23,319
the law and not the tools then it's very

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,269
hard for anybody to complain especially

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,579
think about the definition all software

00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:32,860
should be openly licensed what it means

00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:35,619
in a jurisdiction airy system so we

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,899
started to realize that we had to create

00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:40,360
tools and processes and we did it with

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:43,419
those key technologies that you saw in

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,520
three years plan so

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,310
by choosing those technologies and

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,319
really eating our own dog food in

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,289
started to see how we could implement

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,990
proper processes and tools so we started

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,580
to work on how the source code was

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,810
published and released and we passed

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,150
from something like this to this very

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,830
normal for you some sometimes it was not

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,139
very something very normal for the

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,669
people who are working in the public

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,500
administration that documentation as

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,759
well passed from a very long PDF

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,580
sweetened in the forms of the lower

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,250
where you see seen the dairy the decree

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,159
and seeing the raw to read the box and

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,139
of course created a place where you can

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,849
discuss all of your changes and where

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,210
you can just hang out with fellow

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,949
developers but up until now of course

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,900
this is modernizing this is digitizing

00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:38,509
but what is the real the real innovation

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,259
I mean really we have seen this before

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,879
in the u.s. there is 18 F there is in

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,800
France a similar approach from the

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,900
government where they try to publish all

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,770
of their code on github they try to

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,120
open-source them the real the real

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,129
change and I think the real innovation

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,529
that we're trying to bring forward also

00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,300
communicating with our European partners

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,599
is this is the same difference that has

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,000
is between Android and Debian to put it

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,039
to an extreme which both are open-source

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,379
but you know there is a clear difference

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,979
between them and it's of course the open

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:15,439
governance model for with the open

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,029
governance model the people from the

00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,710
community whether they are individual

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,750
developers whether they are companies

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,449
whether there are other actors can

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,689
actually not only contribute and some to

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:28,669
requests and just watch from the outside

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,129
but also contribute and if they wish

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,110
they can take responsibility for a few

00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,060
of the software that are used from

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,479
everybody and from all the citizens

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,269
think of it for example if I we have

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,490
really the toolkit for doing websites in

00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,190
an accessible way which follow respects

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,410
all the guideline what if I do a

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,209
wordpress theme well then this can be

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,140
easily maintained from the community

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,540
there is like some core

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,490
available Italian who want to maintain

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,690
it then this is something that can do

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,600
and of course it doesn't need to be

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,730
Italian many of the technologies that we

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,950
are creating are actually quite generic

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,870
the whole framework about data

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,430
processing and data analytics is

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,500
completely generic users meter base it

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,050
is a superset it is a jupiter notebook

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,030
so those are all things that can be of

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,190
value and it can be shared between the

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,340
systems and with the open governance

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,540
model we are giving power to the

00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,980
community main challenge of course is

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,830
then with the public administration

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,780
itself because well there is some kind

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,000
of fear that you need to overcome when

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,770
you ask people who are used to working

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,240
are very closed and locked environment

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,820
and just release once every one or two

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,710
year to do development in the open

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,110
sometimes from day one sometimes after

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,910
the day of the release then you need to

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,860
change that new mindset where if you

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,260
open a pull request that doesn't really

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,300
mean like okay I'm intruding in your

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,310
work and stepping in your work directly

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,840
it's just like a pull request and you

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,280
have to answer that because it's

00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,910
somebody that can provide a useful

00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,920
contribution

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,410
maybe the center faction it's all wrong

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,240
you you have to explain why so it's a

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,860
new mindset that needs to be put and

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,830
then of course you need to find your

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,570
flows that work because if I'm just

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,520
going to say ok you open everything up

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,470
and you don't provide them a framework

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,300
in which they can work effectively then

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,600
this just impacts productivity and

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,180
they're going to hate you for that so we

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,180
started this community in with a large

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,090
event on 67 of October where we have 800

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,280
developers 27 cities in Italy it was

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,830
there our largest the public hackathon

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,540
ever organized in Europe second one the

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:39,420
largest in the world because Naser big

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:41,040
beat it we were kickstart this community

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,920
we asked for help to develop many of

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,780
those components and all the developers

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,950
to send him successful pull requests

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,660
where were 10 o'clock that and were

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:58,470
nominated as maintainer if they wished

00:10:51,660 --> 00:11:00,300
to be so of course and for the future we

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,610
are trying to now are in the process

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,750
where we already saw our model that is

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,490
working and we're in the process of

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,410
getting things up how do we do that we

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,990
are writing national guidelines

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,430
I want to explicit that when once those

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,810
guidelines are going to be published

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,270
they're going to be binding for all

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,670
public administrations so this is the

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,250
document we're working on right now and

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,020
which will be open for comments by more

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,480
or less the end of this month and of

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,170
course all comments are welcome in this

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,170
sense and in this guidance we want to

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,960
write things such as you need to publish

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,700
and put all your code on a collaborative

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,440
platform of your choice could be github

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,710
it could be yourself hosted gitlab or

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,110
get here or bitbucket or basically

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,850
whatever you want and we're going to

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,820
propose a model a community working

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,200
model this is the github flow it should

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,180
be it will be something similar to the

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,710
Gaeta flow where you have several

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,480
maintainer and you have all public

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,260
administrations working with the same

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,460
code the end goal is to turn all

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,710
servicemen's all the people all the

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,450
coders who are already working for the

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,580
public administration into real

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,020
open-source developers who know how to

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,910
contribute upstream when they use

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,160
upstream projects you know how to

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,400
publish their work how to work together

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,010
and cooperate it was a pretty pretty

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:22,670
challenging task but I think it's a it's

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,440
a highly successful one another key part

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,770
of our strategies their open innovation

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:32,960
hubs what is an open innovation hub is a

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:34,570
way to stabilize this the culture at the

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,490
opening even more it's a series of

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,170
places which are created to promote the

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,700
open culture in cooperation with the

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,339
universities in cooperation with the

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,870
municipalities in cooperation with the

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,150
local institutions so that they can form

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,980
group about open source and open

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,330
practices and to be a part to be a

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,040
reference point for the public

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,600
administrations so that they could

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,280
incorporate so taking the existing

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,520
community and leveraging on the a and

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,190
the work of the existence of of existing

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,350
communities already that do and develop

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,510
open source and give them a way to talk

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,520
to public administrations and on the

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,440
other hand for the public institutions

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,089
have like some kind of feedback when

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,980
they want to create new technologies or

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,300
they have new ideas for the public with

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,070
the public

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,750
all of these of course in constant

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,100
communication with other European

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,360
partners we are speaking about with a

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,770
French team are speaking about with the

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,930
European Union with the UK team so to

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,380
sum it up just like Franco was given on

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,710
that day the possibility of driving the

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,100
machine for for making sure that the

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:44,310
road was even and his dream was to steal

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,810
for one a well we hope that you

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,540
appreciate and you can be our digital

00:13:45,810 --> 00:14:05,000
Amara for the next days thank you very

00:13:48,540 --> 00:14:05,000
much ok

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
mm-hmm

00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:53,710
okay so international guidelines we were

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,350
not mandating any specific platforms of

00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,730
course because it would be I think it

00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,320
would be even illegal to do that

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,720
we're actually in the National Guard and

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,720
we are just giving the requirements for

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,360
a platform and then we are quoting a few

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,550
of the platforms which satisfy those

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,200
standards in the case of black we have

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,210
one for those key technologies that we

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,370
created so if you just go on developers

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,840
that Italy that IT you have the button

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,740
which is black and then you can get your

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,570
invitation well now this has this was

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,580
set up for the hackathon so we wanted to

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,890
keep it as free as possible and then now

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,360
we are having all the developers just be

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,360
there and use that as a reference point

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,420
the thing is it's very very hard to

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,490
choose a good communication method and

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,680
also to a moment a like you could go for

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,100
a hosted solution such as black and

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,100
there you have several competing

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,680
solutions with Pro and cons etc and you

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,450
can go for your hostage yourself which

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,060
was for a hosted solution because it was

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:59,080
easier to set it up and it was easier to

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,710
maintain it in the long run because you

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:08,650
need to stop it at this kind of effort

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:11,290
sorry and github on the other hand the

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,780
Italia organization just github.com /

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,880
Italia it's a completely free

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,650
organisation because all of the the

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,780
repositories that are completely public

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:24,100
and open source so there is no need to

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:26,590
close it up we I can tell you what we

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,270
did for developers Italia which is the

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,950
part of the development of those key

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,420
technologies but then all the

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,340
administration will be able to choose

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,930
with basing or based on their needs

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,940
already we have some regions which are

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,210
housed their own software on some kind

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,310
of SourceForge so it really depends on

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,900
the skills of the administration and and

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,110
what they want to do and what we want to

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:53,280
invest

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:53,280
okay we first you see many hands this is

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,339
so yeah sorry so he says that most most

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,329
contractors will not probably be happy

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:23,480
about the openness of those projects and

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:26,270
releasing them as open source what I can

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,940
tell you is that when like they are

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,880
already obliged by law to release them

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,610
as open source because there is article

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,080
69 which says oil code made custom for

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,360
the public administration should be

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,940
released openly now the definition of

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,640
openly until now has been somehow

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,740
problematic because it was not never

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,059
specified like okay what does it mean

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,740
like basically it just need to be free

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,690
does need to be under certain licenses

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,940
did you need to give you any freedom

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,320
it was summed up in a it was called I

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,120
reuse catalog where you would you would

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,250
be able to give it to other public

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,690
administrations for free which is a

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,940
little bit open source but not exactly

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,590
so what we are doing is by those

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,460
guidelines which will be binding for the

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,860
public administrations you will need to

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,940
release it as open source otherwise you

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:20,299
will not be able to participate in - in

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,799
in the core so it's it will be it will

00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,299
be for you software of course because we

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,270
cannot do it on the previous software

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:28,159
but all new contracts will be made in

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,390
this way now this pretty specific

00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,640
details of course you need to wait for

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,140
the guidelines to be out and published

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,600
and of course there is a commenting work

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,600
so for this is for the exact details but

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,279
in general I hope this answers your

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,549
question ok ok I see hands in the back

00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,549
ok yeah

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:55,330
uh-huh this is a very very good question

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,100
so he was asking about whether the

00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,040
documentation in the forum is just for

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,350
technical development or also for this

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,770
general civilian documentation so he

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,930
started out for the forum was created

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,900
for discussing the three year plan so

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,360
very very much a civilian but quite

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,270
technical but still pretty much it was

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,050
not the accumulation for the software

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:22,420
then they better have the redox part so

00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,520
the technical documentation was created

00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,170
for the software but now we are more or

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,020
less in the process of merging the two

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,460
things or we are using the

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,590
infrastructure that we created for the

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,470
technical documentation also for example

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,360
to host versions of the law one very

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,710
good example is though that digital

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,190
administration code which was the first

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,960
law which was put on github completely

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,300
version and you see you can see all the

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,710
dips between the version from 2006 till

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,780
the one which was passed just last

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,770
December and you can see how it evolves

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,620
with regular git diff tool and then you

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,390
can read it on radio dogs etc and the

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,940
idea is to try to bring this forward

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,350
more and more probably the interface

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,700
will need to be adjusted because of

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,130
course you are serving two different

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,100
technical use cases but we are going in

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,630
this direction and you have also to

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,040
consider that most of the documentation

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,180
for the technical part of course for the

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,730
loads is in Italian but for the

00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,690
technical part we are trying to be as

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,310
international as possible most of the

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,320
documentation is actually in English for

00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,170
example about all the data processing is

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,160
is done like that and it's also

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,930
interesting to see that other

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,350
governments are doing a little some

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,910
stuff

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,260
similar to this an example what the

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,350
French government which release the

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,600
software is called open fisca which is a

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,010
Python package where they they you can

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,300
run simulations for your country you

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:42,430
basically write a Python classes and you

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,170
you define the fiscal system of your

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,880
country and then it's completely generic

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,980
an you can run simulations you can see

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,470
how to optimize taxes you can propose

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,510
the reforms and then see the impact of

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,860
that and you're working on this we're

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,410
also applying for a google Summer of

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,940
Code and this is for example if we get

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,290
accepted

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,180
the google Summer of Code organization

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,380
one of the challenges that we try to

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:27,570
propose to adapted for our fiscal system

00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:29,580
okay no questions so you're asking about

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,170
like okay so you're asking about how

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,580
what is the scope of the program it is

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,140
just a new software for all software

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,970
open source software so the answer is

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:41,610
different so article 60 I go back to the

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,380
low article 68 you have to choose open

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,050
source solutions first what it means is

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,450
I am a public administration and I need

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,040
a new piece of software the first thing

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,600
to do I have to do is I have to evaluate

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,730
what is already present before asking

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,620
for it to be made for myself and if I

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,150
found an open source package that is

00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,160
good for me or that can be modified it

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,530
for to suit my needs I have to choose

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,210
that I am mandated body to do that if

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,100
instead I choose to have something new

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,810
made for me then we need to create it

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,970
and release it for everybody as open

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,280
source what we are doing is we are

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,320
adding a collaborative model and an open

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,150
way because until now it was open source

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,980
like Android okay which is open source

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,110
but you just get a table every now and

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,910
then instead with this model you are

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,620
able actually to maintain it and create

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,730
a community around that a community

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,270
which could be of other public

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,430
administration citizen everything for

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,950
the governance question if I if I got it

00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,630
correctly so asking like who are you

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,730
reporting to we report directly to the

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,040
Prime Minister so this is the head of

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,900
all the public administrations so once

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,990
we do with this work and we release this

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,090
code the presidency the government the

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,240
municipality is the hospitals the

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:54,500
universities the schools everybody will

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,500
be covered by this please

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,909
okay so the question was mm-hmm if I

00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:36,200
create a model where you have to release

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,969
an open source the software that you

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,999
create does do this doesn't this create

00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:42,440
an incentive for more public

00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,529
administrations to wait for somebody

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,859
else to do it and then get it for free

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:50,809
well listen no meaning that if you if

00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,489
you have something that you need usually

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,349
usually actually what happens is the

00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:56,209
other way around so you recreate the

00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,549
same software over and over because you

00:23:56,209 --> 00:24:00,169
believe that what is there until now

00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:02,869
it's not really good or not exactly

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:05,259
satisfying your needs I don't think that

00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:09,589
these model changes very much this

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:10,190
because this was kind of the way it was

00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,950
until now

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,200
you have still article 68 an article 69

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,849
are older than our team are older than

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,339
this collaborative model it's just the

00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:21,889
framework that was already present and

00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,659
which we are working so in theory

00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:25,969
already now this could have been a

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:28,159
problem because all public

00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:30,200
administrations are obliged to give to

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,690
somebody else the software if they if

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,329
they are asked for it for free so and

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,369
this is not a problem that is arising so

00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:40,789
yes in theory if this is a problem what

00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:43,159
you're quoting but in practice it didn't

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,989
really show up and actually we need to

00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,129
encourage more of this participation and

00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:49,629
more of this maintenance of the same

00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,629
software I have

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,799
home holidays get more

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:14,010
they can allocate their budget to that

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,010
group and then by pulling that money

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,800
or just not at all because my apartment

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,580
has 5% of what I really need to hire a

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,320
human

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,460
but when I can give the budget from

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,029
somebody else in the making create a

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,029
pool of fun

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:46,380
yeah absolutely but this is more less

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,380
experience we saw some units

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:22,940
and actually okay

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:55,340
okay so the question was for for the

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:56,539
internet speakers here's speaking about

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,970
his experience in the Dutch government

00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:03,350
where the bigger problem was to convince

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:05,419
the manager rate layer that you had to

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,649
like that if you do something as

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,029
open-source than it benefits everybody

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,370
and not just the people who are funding

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,179
you then this is a problem and then how

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:15,649
to educate them not to like open source

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,120
is not that much more expensive so you

00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:18,889
should do open source in general because

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,340
it's better does it sum it up sorry

00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:26,450
it had to be a big summary okay thank

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:38,000
you if I actually read five minutes left

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:40,070
so enough time's up well in Italy we are

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,190
in a regular situation because they have

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,860
to release it as open source so you can

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,260
kind of avoid the question in this way

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,080
but in general I would say that leading

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,669
by example is always the best practice

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,200
in in a way we are doing that also in

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,320
Italy by trying to be an example in

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,539
Europe and try to put it as as as a

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,649
reform point for all the other

00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:04,460
governments to try to see and enjoy

00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:06,799
because I honestly believe that not only

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,539
Italian but this is a personal belief

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,830
that not only Italian institutions

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,600
should participate in this kind of

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,279
effort so that was quoting before the

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,929
French government has also released a

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,269
very good open software which can be

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,070
adapted and used in other countries so

00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:21,830
if we of course there will be some

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,230
software which will be just for a nation

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:27,620
or just to comply with a particular law

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,700
or just like a design choice for example

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,549
for the the web the web tool kits but

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,340
otherwise there should be should be

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,889
created I think a much more wide

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,380
collaboration platform where where these

00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:44,120
things can go and evolve

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,490
of course sometimes it's quite hard to

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,529
just convince the management another

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,049
problem that we have many times is well

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,610
but if it opens open it up then it's

00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,100
less secure

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,419
which is of course not exactly the case

00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,630
but then you need to talk them through

00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:02,720
it and and what we have seen working is

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,659
that often best practices really help

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,549
and we try to apply them in our work

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,990
also because it's not really nice to go

00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,480
to somebody and say well you have to do

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,130
it anyways you know it's because I'm I'm

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,200
the boss or I'm the one who is putting

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,880
down the guidelines so it's always

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,010
better to convince them and to have them

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,779
who means that opening things up is a

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:24,919
good way it takes a little bit of effort

00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,409
for example one of the things we try it

00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:30,950
first is to have the ticketing system be

00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:34,789
part we put on the open and I'm having

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,010
like all of this work on and then you

00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,960
create a workflow and then you there are

00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,000
very very scared at first and then they

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,659
see that it's actually good and I start

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,919
to receive a good quality contribution

00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:48,679
and another example is that with the

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,500
agencies called photographical which

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,929
creates the the identity cards they have

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,149
a middleware for reading the cards and

00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,860
so you could build your own application

00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,690
you could have it as an authorization

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,919
mechanism for your office or a for a gym

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,149
or for the buses but it was Windows only

00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,179
you managed to have it released as open

00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:10,010
source for the hackathon just two days

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,710
before and during the hackathon somebody

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,559
took it and converted it for imported to

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,600
Arduino so now everybody could use just

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,820
an Arduino and all the Italian citizens

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,010
not all of them because they need your

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,480
ID card but more and more Italian

00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,919
citizens in the next ten years their

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,919
rollout will be complete hopefully also

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,960
sooner we can just create your

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,090
authorization mechanism with that and so

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,500
they so this is a real real good value

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,820
and this is when they start to

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,590
understand the power of open source and

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,059
of opening things up because I think

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,070
it's time to receive contribution we

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,240
have the immediate feedback and so on so

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:46,340
yeah best practices to pretty shortly

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,779
okay wait I'll just go in order because

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,419
and I've tried to keep the answers short

00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,769
I saw some hands there since all of the

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:56,320
time but I didn't see them anymore

00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:56,320
so we'll go one okay good

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:20,650
okay so the question was about this is

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,470
this is more open source and not about

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,520
hacking what I can tell you the hacking

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,400
part if I understand your question

00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,800
correctly is about the platform's which

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,930
are open and let's say an API first

00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,280
approach where all the government

00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,460
agencies and all the services are

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,170
exposed first via API so you can build

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,090
your own applications or this is of

00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,770
course a very very broad answer because

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,930
you get all kind of API is an all kind

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,370
of system but to give you to give you an

00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,200
example the data and analytics framework

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,540
will collect all of their data from all

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,430
public administrations and then you have

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,470
a central interface to analyze it and

00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:56,200
it's the only source of truth because

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,850
it's where like you get real-time feet

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,190
it's not like an open data portal where

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,100
somebody just got needs to go and upload

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,350
a CSV file every now and then when they

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,470
remember but it just like has live feed

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,300
from the day light the day data directly

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,730
and then of course depending on the

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,850
access level policies you can go and

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:19,560
analyze it and for all the datasets that

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:22,630
are opened by low then you can just

00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,310
create your account or login and then

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,930
you have a Jupiter notebook with all of

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,310
the data directly inside and you can do

00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,010
your analysis and you can publish them

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:32,590
for others to see so in this case if you

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,270
are an activist or a journalist or

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,640
citizens who wants to do some batch

00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,970
boarding you can do it easily in this

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,550
kind of framework the electronic ID card

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,620
is another example where you can build

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:47,320
your tools and end devices and

00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:50,340
authorization with that yes but can you

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,340
think the last question very quickly

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,200
okay please

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,640
[Music]

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,220
huh

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:24,210
okay so the question were we will do

00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:26,070
that we will do that but in general yes

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:34,430
article 68 is already working we already

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:34,430
have examples and thank you very much

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:44,189
