00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:32,549
when you just wants more difference play

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:44,549
to Pacific affects other it's important

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:47,549
to be into that

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,549
perfect

00:01:51,940 --> 00:03:15,430
so this is basically a petition that

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,430
will suffice

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,069
[Music]

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,650
when we try to stay perfect we already

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,140
have thousands of exiting their personal

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:57,050
lives and that something that was

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:59,300
written by contains counters say okay

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,650
thank you anymore you will just switch

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,950
to something else that's strange for us

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,810
was we need to visualize on we'll see

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,810
why but we need to

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,250
[Music]

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,139
[Music]

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:35,150
because so many women the camel a

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:41,290
mechanical dozen servants to dip it in

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,290
the traffic it was free

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,760
[Applause]

00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:58,759
because some prairies that 90 people are

00:07:53,269 --> 00:08:00,860
cleaning with this world all winners and

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,499
looking at ya as you've seen that too

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,389
from the passenger on some time well

00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:08,300
penny has there are only two perspective

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,860
we've driven straight over the data so

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,409
that producer on the Syria that

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:17,079
pregnancy perform on the tool into the

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:17,079
web exists again

00:08:52,589 --> 00:09:28,510
you have so that that's why we stopped

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:31,270
it people protect what so first with a

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,370
database is a that so party but maybe

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:47,140
they did or somebody that happened that

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:53,740
interface and the people of trying we

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:59,260
only have one identity single to only

00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,930
wants some kind of deficit they're worse

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,460
tonight which also use Cassandra which

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,460
at the time uses

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,680
so we start walking today so the goal

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,730
was to get something like that done

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,540
well then tomorrow

00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,740
Anthony graphics well fixed customer

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,570
yeah is that once one of the component

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,210
becomes that we just want to be able to

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,330
increase the number of instances we were

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,570
nothing to do anything wrong so let's

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,570
say

00:11:47,890 --> 00:12:09,790
prophytes on the spot basically

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:11,770
compression pressure when to change the

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:18,910
trick exists in the database and

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:22,980
everyone doesn't in the database so this

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:29,100
is us when we need to know distributors

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:30,730
to things the first one is to define the

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,170
state of the god

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,760
so I say that the nine when we need to

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,320
return the discipline to expand men's

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:45,460
bath even management on the tango return

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,669
points the points possible and then

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,499
graphics will take up almost so

00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:53,499
since if I right-click on this thing

00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,619
perfect

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,309
[Music]

00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:10,219
two things new batteries the points the

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:12,309
points are two pairs of thanks Tom thank

00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,309
you

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:21,709
this Isis mutation you need to stop this

00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:23,719
professor addition he puts two 1.74 one

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,389
yeah but that will take a lot of things

00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:29,059
so what we do instead is that mister one

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:32,239
points per minute for one week then one

00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:35,569
day for a month when then went there to

00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,929
hit for one year on this way typical tan

00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:42,349
theta

00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:46,189
dozens of considered service might have

00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:48,499
to get one straight right there on the

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,439
right path to get every time we do on

00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:52,429
your own is a point on simple computer

00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,379
nice

00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,379
asteroids very tough which is not

00:13:54,379 --> 00:14:01,970
exactly a principal the same pattern as

00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:05,299
grants the other person to group is too

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,489
strong names too there's many different

00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:10,999
things it's also the telepresence traits

00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:14,379
with matrix so like resolution when my

00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,379
first time business rates

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:29,360
which I say so we decided to go with

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:33,470
Tessa laughs - but if your dad doesn't

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,870
want to enforce I'm not referring to to

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,510
explain how you can do that with DES

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,660
tomorrow is not a system where as you

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,660
would think

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Superboy's main thing that we talk Thank

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,250
You Sara the base middle points it's

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,730
pretty simple right we put the stuff in

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:58,840
Taylor when storm the Train found a stop

00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:04,120
point fast intuitive iterate then

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:07,700
rewards which is currently an organism

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:11,570
that works if you want available points

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:14,840
of the same significant we will try to

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:19,850
expand your earth points because if you

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:26,050
try that tombstone that's here now but

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:31,790
basically that would have forgiven you

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:36,620
so it is something that is slightly more

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,930
completed personal path but problem is

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,760
that instead of having one line damn

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,720
straight we tied the points in groans

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,440
tender factory serous pericardium

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,430
classic squats which we have

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,710
and we do one night with the second

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,630
direction place and we just threaten

00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,420
your line after that on the data memory

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,580
RAM which allows us when we want to

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,270
remove all points just to remove their

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:10,190
life completely cannot remove sales

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,190
inside this time which is more efficient

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:18,710
is that we are 20 the resolution which

00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:22,320
allows us with density is present for

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,410
the poles from today we want to get them

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,240
all for the police presence here we

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:37,620
might want to put them on installation

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:40,320
or something of the compression so it

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:47,220
looks like this you have the metric

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:49,250
which is needs you have the stuff to

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:55,950
block the offset within the clock

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:57,300
dependence that is even more competitive

00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,839
and that's when you move towards a

00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,839
petition

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:18,510
so that's points so when rights to just

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:21,780
add one line with this vintage the

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:26,880
movement comes from the process that you

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:32,910
want inside that as you might remember

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:35,370
in system as its own ballistics match

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,480
with one gun for us please

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,480
I mean thanks

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,580
if X is so you have components that are

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,810
selected by price with White House on

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,940
Buffy's computing think they'll start

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,160
with name on the star you would not

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,840
teach that something that they model

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,210
only expecting the right kind of thing

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,690
looks easy is when you have one aluminum

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,120
matrix as probably ten gigabytes or

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,360
something you can just do correct inside

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
back

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,060
the first idea was to use the left to

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:18,460
tell that what that works well thanks

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,240
web tools in various training to empower

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,430
ordinary sneer selfie first it was hard

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,920
enough to migrate to one of the ways

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,800
that we don't want to remember to use

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,490
two of them so we try to do at the

00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:38,640
testify directly that's all right not

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,640
the best that Israel exists but tesam

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,690
produced by sassy which is a similarity

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,160
index some problems

00:19:46,580 --> 00:20:23,510
because for similarity with this please

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,510
thank you can just Express

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:30,849
since the metric and of such a function

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:34,879
we can create a cube at this for over

00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:36,919
6,000 for you just exclude the one where

00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:42,320
the Google what's with the layer things

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:46,609
when chemicals and that would be the

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:51,830
poisons the things that your face does

00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:56,479
not punish for Baker's crises and the

00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:00,289
one of this Carter could be from 0 to 9

00:20:56,479 --> 00:21:06,139
or any doctor says he doesn't support

00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:13,219
that so it's time for the percolator we

00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:16,809
will just replace the completely by this

00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:21,169
match this I know measured by a machine

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:26,929
will do select where of the all starts

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:36,619
with match of the no arrest has a it's

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:39,649
not a physics experiment price 21 free

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:44,019
web stuff match with say ok is the one

00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:44,019
which measured by Romans matching

00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:54,139
Network so as long as we as well I think

00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:57,529
it was 15 units that work well after

00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:59,539
that don't say well we sometimes

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,179
come with students

00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:04,009
thank you Miss face it's not that home

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,839
because when you have one with us to

00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:07,839
display on tremendous impacts women

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,789
[Music]

00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:58,760
decima well then so what can you do so

00:22:38,200 --> 00:23:09,290
we we hope that we are solving one whole

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:11,300
spectrum when what it's not yet

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:14,780
beautiful is patience

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:17,240
we still have 16 banks police after

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,160
compression must be because we did not

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,190
try to expand spats debts as you can

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,620
remember most pressing point for us is

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:29,600
not to lose one wait to add one note

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:32,120
that's what because concealer is in 20s

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,350
manifesto by some point we realized

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,450
between Cochran's movies but it just

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,490
promotes when you said basically the

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,370
thirties it's released and ultimately

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,260
one by one I'm gonna be to which was

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,160
pretty nice is rather I think you spend

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,160
twenty weeks

00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:28,710
because you just installed both with a

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:33,210
typhoon whisper center stone Phillips

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:36,990
who both effects women can run one of

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:40,650
them that's not the most efficient to

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:43,860
Google for whisper based traffic but

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:46,890
what you can do about that is just right

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,190
because enough from tessandra home

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,920
whisper there is that is bigger effects

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,700
first whisper on that you can use which

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,710
will just melt - you can just do that

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,110
