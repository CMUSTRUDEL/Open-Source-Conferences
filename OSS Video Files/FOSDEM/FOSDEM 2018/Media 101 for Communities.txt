thank you I just need to make sure that

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,520
I'm actually talking about what I'm

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,880
talking office kidding um so hi how are

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,050
you

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,270
everybody good eat all the chocolate so

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:39,100
snacks up here you're all good

00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:41,290
so as Leslie said I am a former former

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,930
technology journalist I have been doing

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:51,240
as I counted up over 25 years of writing

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,750
about technology either books or actual

00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,560
newspapers that real paper behind you

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,750
and and websites so for over 25 years so

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,540
maybe they thought I would know what I

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,110
was talking about so let's let's find

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,119
out so two reminders that are going to

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,789
be very important to this presentation

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,100
you must not forget that I do this for

00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,219
American audiences I don't have to do

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,759
this but I'm going to kind of help out

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:25,270
remember April is tax time in the United

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,539
States this is important I'm not going

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,240
to tell you why go spoil the thing okay

00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:34,539
and the second part of that is because

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,399
it's tax time April is the busiest time

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:40,389
of the year for any tax accountants okay

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,539
what am I talking about

00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:46,869
well let me tell you a story very

00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:49,509
quickly about 15 years ago I used to be

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:53,319
a volunteer at a hospital emergency room

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:56,590
or an A&E Center as they call it in

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,469
Britain okay so my job was to help

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,630
people get from the door to the room

00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,149
where the nearest would see them and say

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,179
oh you just need a band-aid

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:10,750
oh you you've lost your arm you need to

00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:13,510
go into surgery yep things like that so

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,150
one night I'm working at the desk and

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm letting people in

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,890
and an in comes this woman who is

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:26,030
limping badly she's been at work and

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,610
she's fallen and she's twisted her ankle

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,670
so I get her wheelchair I take her to

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:37,400
the triage room we're not very busy so

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:41,000
she goes right in and I was good about

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,430
15 minutes later a couple comes in

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,120
they're young they're very he's very

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,819
handsome

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,730
she's very pretty they're dressed up

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,160
very well she's bent over

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,970
she has what appears to be food

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,660
poisoning

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:01,410
so she's very sick so I get her the pan

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,629
just saying Hayes I walk her over to the

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,450
triage room the first lady in the

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,040
wheelchair is still in the room so I put

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,180
them in the hallway and they say please

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,620
wait here the nurse will be right here I

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,290
start to go back to my desk

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,530
the nurse is done with patient 1 the

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,090
lady in the wheelchair wheels are out to

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,359
the waiting room because it's not very

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,970
serious dating the wheelchair sees the

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:31,470
couple sitting there in the hall says

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,859
what the bleep are you doing here turns

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,190
out lady in the wheelchair was the guy

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:45,530
of the gentleman with the other woman

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:50,519
who exists so he gets really awkward

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,139
really bad and what made it worse and

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,169
I'm not going to go into every detail

00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:58,049
but basically lady in the wheelchair the

00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:01,109
wife decided that she was going to get

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:04,620
into a physical conflict with both of

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:07,260
them okay so she stands up in the chair

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,900
immediately regret this decision because

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,930
her ankle folds out from under her so

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,510
she falls down and now she's trying to

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,910
kick and hook from the floor and I'm

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,470
trying to pull them apart and we were

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,930
calling for security and I'm a

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,800
non-violent person so this is this is

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,639
all just really bad so it turned out

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,819
that a couple of the mayor for six years

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,189
lady who a felon at work yes and I that

00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:39,110
was she very good an accountant and she

00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:43,389
was supposed to be working late all

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:46,610
through April so the husband mr. sly dog

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:49,669
decided he'd be safe on a date until his

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,279
date got sick so there you go

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:56,659
end of my story and why is this even

00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:59,539
remotely important because if I were

00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:01,580
writing this as a reporter the first

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,349
paragraph would have said a married

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,810
couple of six years received more than

00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:07,939
physical injuries Wednesday night when

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,729
ill time visits to the ER brought

00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:14,060
together the wife the husband and his

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:17,810
mistress and then they would have been a

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,879
blow-by-blow the point of this is you

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,389
have to when you're talking about your

00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:26,300
project you have to know your audience

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,699
when I told you that story your friends

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,529
we're here together we're hanging out at

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,349
Frost and we're doing all the cool stuff

00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:35,900
we're sharing chocolate I'm just hanging

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:38,779
out I'm telling you a funny story right

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,310
we do this all the time and that

00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,669
literally is the funniest story I know

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:49,009
so which by the way shows a lot about a

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,770
reporter and you're reading a website or

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,120
newspaper or whatever this is the way

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,319
I'm going to tell you the story because

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,000
talking about it and telling a funny

00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,460
anecdote I've buried the lede right but

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
in a news story you let the lead up

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,839
front

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,469
you want to pull people in okay

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,330
and regardless you know you know the

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,569
story and the value of thereof

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,719
that's what you're gonna put it up front

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,080
okay

00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:24,529
so lesson number one know your audience

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,629
if you're a community person and you

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:28,520
want to talk it to the media you're

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,250
gonna have to know who you're talking to

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,250
because what's important to you about

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:38,449
your project may not be the thing that

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,250
the the journalist is interested in and

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,729
it may not be the thing that the

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,460
journalists reader

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,909
are interested in or viewers if you're

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,120
talking electronic media media has their

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:55,559
own story to tell okay

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,479
and most reporters if they're any good

00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:00,779
are probably going to look for things

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:05,550
for a story about major changes in the

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:09,270
industry news is about change it's not

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,919
about the status quo nobody's gonna I'm

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,379
sorry nobody's gonna do a story about

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,360
the fact that every mm the FOSDEM is

00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,330
jammed

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,569
okay because that's not news that's like

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,180
saying oh look the Sun came up today

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:28,409
okay that's but if somebody did a show

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,089
like heaven forbid that possum was under

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:35,999
attended you know that might be a story

00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:38,990
okay it's a change something new or

00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:44,249
something that has larger system effects

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,349
okay a acquisition of one company here

00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:49,620
might affect the broader ecosystem in

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:53,459
the technology a change to a community

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,830
project and their dependencies may you

00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:59,159
know have ripple effects all across your

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,229
ecosystem okay if you decide to like I

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,199
don't know switch from one compiler to

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,229
another you know this is an example

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,279
those are the kinds of things that

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,520
journalists are going to be looking for

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,849
when you talk to them and the problem is

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,969
we usually have the story in our heads

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:20,999
that I'm writing the coolest piece of

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:24,930
software ever and it's going to be

00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:26,849
awesome and it really probably is okay

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,490
but the thing about it is so is

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,649
everybody else we're all writing the

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,649
coolest piece of software so you have to

00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:37,620
figure out a way to tell your story in a

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:41,120
way that makes you know a media

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,159
journalist kind of figure out you know

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,949
how to tell your story too you got to

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,670
get them interested so how do we get

00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:54,089
them connected with you

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:58,050
okay so there's three major ways

00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:01,920
first thing is to get personal time and

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,660
time again what a lot of people do is so

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,540
talk to somebody who's in public

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,129
relations and the public relations

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,199
person says well tell me about your

00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,029
project I'll write a press release for

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:16,230
you and we'll send it to every reporter

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:19,980
we know okay I can guarantee you that

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,680
every reporter they know has seen wave

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,009
after wave of press releases that may or

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,600
may not interested them and even if they

00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:33,180
are genuinely part of their you know the

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,569
beat that they cover they're just

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,829
getting hit delete reporters have been

00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:42,689
with issues they can't cover everything

00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:47,009
okay they can't talk about every new

00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:48,930
start up and they will and and PR people

00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:51,749
who will tell you that the best way to

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,790
go about hitting the media is to just

00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:57,089
blitz everybody

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,579
they were sadly mistaken I guarantee you

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:02,939
that most reporters are just gonna turn

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:04,589
that off it's just noise and they don't

00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:08,100
want to hear it so you have to be

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,839
targeted in who you talk to you as a

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,819
community person if you don't have a

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,100
budget for a PR person you're gonna have

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,829
to do this yourself okay

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,189
so you need to think about who you know

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,920
who is writing in my industry like then

00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:26,220
if I'm working on I'm just gonna pick on

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,410
this a virtualization project okay

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,370
who's writing about other virtualization

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,470
projects not mine necessarily but you

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,990
know who's who's talking about VMware

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,600
he's talking about you know cloud

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:44,819
services and you know whatever

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:49,170
KVM you find those people and you target

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:50,990
your message towards them okay another

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,480
thing that you need to do is pitch

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,579
softly okay you want to make sure that

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,009
the writer once you find the right

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,899
journalists and I do say writer a lot

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,509
and I'm not discounting radio and

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,980
television but in our business probably

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,559
the first people you're going to reach

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,569
unless you're very lucky it's gonna be

00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:15,000
somebody who's writing for a website or

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:17,009
a blog you want to you want to find once

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,459
you find the writer in session you want

00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:22,799
to fine-tune the pitch to them you don't

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,679
want to you know you want to make sure

00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,350
that you you look at the recent work and

00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,799
find connections to the story that they

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,259
told or they been telling but you also

00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,769
need to be careful here because I've

00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:40,980
seen this you know so a nicer way of

00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:44,160
doing this would be hey I just saw your

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,740
recent article about you know high tech

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,000
blanka's and I wanted to mention the

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,610
warm feet project you know which is a we

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,769
feel feel is a great way of solving the

00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:01,799
eternal problem of freezing feet okay

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,490
something like that I'm a journalist not

00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:09,660
a novelist take it easy okay all right

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:12,600
but what you don't want to do is say hey

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,999
I just saw your article and you didn't

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,459
mention the warm feet project at all and

00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,199
you you just saw a terrible writer and I

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:23,129
want you to write an article about my

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:26,939
project right now hand to God I've

00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:30,360
gotten dozens of those okay what do you

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,899
think my reaction was you don't know me

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,720
very well

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:37,350
yeah well delete yeah I might actually

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,899
reply but that's another good okay so

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,660
you want to be cool about it you know

00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:45,389
you're hey you you're talking about this

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,299
you're part of that technology sphere to

00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,009
would you like to look at us and if they

00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,540
say no that's okay

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,959
because you're trying to establish

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,139
connections it may be slow and that's

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,410
frustrating but you got to do it and

00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,049
basically be relevant what you do not

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,579
want to do how many people have heard

00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:11,699
the term open washing or cloud washing

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,960
that's a good one do you know that when

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:16,270
I was reporter well

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,440
no you don't know I will I don't even

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:24,310
think I counted how many times I got

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:28,120
some press release or pitch that was

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:31,840
talking about now made for the cloud you

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:37,030
know like toothbrushes made for the club

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,980
I'm not kidding okay you get that stuff

00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,860
all the time you can and and something

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,670
washing is a common effect in this

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,130
industry

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,100
ain't quite as hot so I'm gonna try to

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,780
make my whatever my gizmo my software

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,770
whatever I'm gonna try to make that

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:57,220
relevant to the hot thing right now

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:59,230
it's containers so if I will reporter

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,420
right now I'm sure my inbox would be

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:07,360
full of container oriented stories okay

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,700
don't do that unless it's valid I mean

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,800
if you've got a container story then by

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,830
all means don't tell your container

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,620
story but don't change your story or try

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,350
to paint a new picture of it just to try

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,460
to get in with a certain media person or

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,380
a media outlet to that end stay on

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,170
target

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,990
all right Star Wars so it works okay you

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,340
want it you know you want to be you know

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:40,530
talking about what you are good at okay

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:44,500
I call this stay in your lane okay

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,680
last week a reporter from AP contacted

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,290
me and wanted me to answer questions

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,460
about how Red Hat was dealing with the

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:57,100
specter of meltdown crisis I'm like I

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,320
would know anything about that on the

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,920
community guy I'm not a choral developer

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,020
now if I were an idiot I would have said

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,680
sure I'll talk to the reporter you know

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,510
no that's bad I stayed in my name I

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,270
found somebody else to talk to the

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,550
reporter you need to do that too if

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,640
don't get excited if somebody says hey

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,740
you want to comment on this and you

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,220
think I'm gonna get my project in the on

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,790
the website or newspaper or whatever

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:31,590
don't do that stay relevant

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:33,720
okay other things that you wanted so you

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:38,100
know talk about what you know and don't

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:42,660
stray from that also to a related thing

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,150
don't be a gossip three weeks ago I got

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,590
somebody from away a popular radio show

00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,720
in the u.s. I don't know where these

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,440
people are finding me they were they

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,880
were they wanted me to talk about IBM

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,800
okay I don't know what they wanted to

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,260
talk to me about IBM for cuz I've never

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,260
worked for IBM but I was not talking to

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,870
them about IBM because I don't you know

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,550
I used to compute you know its Lenovo I

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,130
don't even use their computers anymore

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:12,540
I got nothing you know don't be a gossip

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,640
because every once in a while like oh

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,040
let's see I'm trying to think there's

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,740
this guy he developed the Linux kernel

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,440
and sometimes he says things

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,200
controversial what's that guy's name

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,690
something Toby I don't know I don't know

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,130
anyway so there will be people come

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,680
around say hey what do you think about

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,570
what Lena said you know you know and

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,160
you'll be like no bad guys are told

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,350

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,120
get your name in the in the website it

might get your project in the website

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,210
because you're get I'm going to say

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,190

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:51,840
said this about Lena serve all that move

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,640
not only you burning Bridget's then you

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,580
kind of get the reputation as somebody

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,650
who's talking out of school as we say in

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,050
the United States so you don't want to

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,860
do that it's tempting it as that is no

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:08,250
comment is a great way of doing it even

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:15,420
if you think you're sacrificing a way to

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:18,750
connect also eerie chable I know we live

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,310
in an era of privacy I know that privacy

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,079
is very important it's certainly

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,209
important to me but you need to have

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,970
your contact information out there so

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,790
people can find you because this has

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,570
happened to me as a reporter a billion

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,480
times

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,970
hey I bet the person that one's project

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,640
awesome would be great to talk to you

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,640
about this story I'm doing

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,130
about awesome talk you know and the

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,000
cruellest software projects in the world

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:49,179
if only I could find his or her email

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,179
address

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,610
oops

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,240
you know and that has happened so many

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:02,540
times you've got to be reachable make a

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,230
fake email right press that your project

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,790
bad org or whatever do that maintain

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,000
your privacy that's cool

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,890
but definitely have a contact link so

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,590
people can reach out to you and find out

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,270
what you're about another thing you need

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,520
to do is make sure you on board for the

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,410
media to now all morning is a concept

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,350
that really needs to get a lot more

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,900
attention onboarding is when you make it

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,299
very easy for new people to come to your

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,580
project and figure out what it is how to

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,770
use it and why they want to use it and

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,700
then make sure you give them a link to

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:42,260
download it if your software okay or buy

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,620
it if your hardware or whatever you're

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,270
doing okay

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,510
onboarding is very important and um for

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,309
new users and it is very important for

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:55,220
journalists as well journalists need to

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:57,919
see what you're doing and what you're

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,780
about it's very difficult for a

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,030
journalist to come in because they just

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,240
don't have the bandwidth and try to sit

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,790
there and say is this a cloud project is

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,270
this virtualization what's going I don't

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:14,480
know you know and so you've basically

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,690
lost them in the old days we used to

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,280
hand out you know kilts physical things

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,440
we'd have the software we'd have

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,480
pamphlets we'd have sheets of paper with

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,750
folders and they were all laminated and

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,140
multi fast and Cobden things like that

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,240
we don't do that anymore you put that on

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,160
your website if you really really want

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,130
to have something to hand out put it on

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,160
a USB stick and hand that to a reporter

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:44,270
at a conference build something make

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,510
sure that you have it very clear concise

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:50,300
language on what your project is make it

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:54,550
easier for media people also

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:57,680
be concise okay journalists and writers

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,710
used to have you know physical

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,440
constraints when I started and you know

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:08,510
as an old sir on the paper with actual

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:12,440
ink right I series a measure than inches

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,390
or centimeters in in Europe okay you had

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,180
a certain amount of space if you wrote

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,880
too much your story would become you

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,560
know cut off electronic media like

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,450
websites we don't have that problem

00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,340
anymore you can pretty much write all

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,750
you want but there is such a thing about

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:33,080
being brief okay so don't be surprised

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,000
if the story that you started telling

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,420
the reporter about the dumb thing that

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:49,090
they developer did like last to say you

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:49,090
know finally ends so

00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:07,629
that's it if you're gonna yeah yes

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
yep you can get you gave it yeah so you

00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,710
give me a question

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,710
No

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:30,900
so in the past there were you know

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,900
resources to help media out were like

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,809
yes Jarro

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,490
she's referring to an online database

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:44,620
that sort of like kind of tried to

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,010
connect all the different disparate free

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,710
and open source projects known as Faro

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:53,860
Harlow is still out there I have used it

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,289
in quite some time so I'm not sure how

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,809
active it is but there are places for

00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:00,610
you to go in the free and open source

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,250
software community to kind of get your

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,309
name out there your website should be

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,960
your front door definitely your social

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,230
media presence which I didn't really

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:16,030
talk about is also a way to do that as

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:18,700
well it's a lot of people would say why

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,590
do I need to worry about media and I've

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,710
got social media and I can just tell my

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:26,260
story all the live long day there is a

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:34,419
certainly u.s. politician that uses

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:36,669
Twitter a lot and I really don't see a

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:42,100
decrease in the amount of news story

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:44,919
about this guy okay so you can you can

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,039
tweet and Facebook and Google+ and

00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,320
diaspora all you want that's fine but

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,390
the content that you do on social media

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,380
it's most compelling or actually

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,450
long-form articles about you okay but

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,669
but yeah so to the question there are

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,440
additional resources out there and I'm

00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:04,690
not saying by the way that all PR people

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,610
are bad you just have to find once you

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,400
know what they're doing and don't

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,400
promise the noon session

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:32,559
oh I'm good really

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,940
yes and and I and I brought up the

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,470
example of the blanket and the warm feet

00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,770
and then things like that if you are a

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,350
part of that broader ecosystem then you

00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:08,110
definitely jump in if you are as you say

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:11,260
orthogonal II tied to that yes do that

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:15,190
but you need to be very careful it's bad

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,500
it can't look awkward okay it's got to

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,820
be a legitimate connection and that's

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,670
the important thing

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,530
but and if some people have done this

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,970
they're like Oh everybody's moving to

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,160
the cloud we need to add cloth

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,010
functionality to our application if

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,260
you've done that then I'll buckle tell

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,260
