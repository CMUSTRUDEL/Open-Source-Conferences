	00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,510
and in stock

00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,420
[Music]

00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:37,520
[Music]

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:41,979
I just want to create a version team and

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,979
this confident right

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:53,900
where you can see all the spectators

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:59,930
first we have known this an original

00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:05,180
gene system so once agree that this

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:08,620
normally is going on which originally

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,620
disappear immediately

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,280
[Music]

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,650
- machine some parts into it - its

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,460
nitrogen the person which has no return

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:35,160
and that's the user so the user has in

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,380
effect the final state of what you want

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,380
to achieve but can tell the system

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:47,390
witnesses and the market investor so we

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,130
first created this than the user base

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:58,250
then he is a Christian and then

00:02:50,130 --> 00:03:01,110
instantly I guess in development already

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,790
threw up some extra to commit or

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:09,489
whatever and the first yeah it's nice

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,480
release their breath the new movie

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,959
though let's do more reprinted metrology

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,129
led to me where two appearances in the

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,129
continent to disaster

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:40,060
disgusted by quite just again and all

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:46,770
the earth user was the final stage what

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,770
was the pen estates will reach so you

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,640
expressing the state mortgage and the

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,640
decorative assistance

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,780
and Sparrow put all the tasks you

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,700
married already

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,680
I said help us every moment we

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,950
fellowship and so on and then

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,610
and designed a specific industry and

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,530
would you mind panel the state of in

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,989
your mind the final state internet super

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:29,639
open to more than just something like

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:31,289
this just with other words I hope they

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,229
don't care of tester someone else came

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:36,300
back to so that's returned inspector

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:42,830
Dillon over to the decorate that

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:46,169
direction but the system is a respected

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,770
now we look at the same example I would

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:54,300
not give the the system itself of the

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:56,340
features and therefore we can connect

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,370
introduce an operator and they operate

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,580
is actually system from steps for the

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,849
user so they use it now as the final

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,060
state of was reached not only mind can

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:12,260
we express it and convinced

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,330
and everyone and more or less easy

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,000
understandable defendants days activity

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,910
and integrator who does all the work

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,740
producer if you again see the user and

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,680
in the red serve you see what the user

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,669
now has their own system it just just

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,050
posts stay in the system and doesn't

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:38,360
care about over intermediaries and gives

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,960
an example of how such states can be

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,370
expressed in Venice and of young people

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,490
that's an extension to enemies with

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,160
traffic communities and we were playing

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,610
a beautiful machine X thanking the

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,370
company is until you see a script from

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,210
virtual machine as you see the kinds of

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:03,430
information object instead implants as

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,430
much memory as you can

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:34,010
duster and then your greatest artists

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:42,170
coming on the work for you it might be

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:44,020
Supremes up now we can use it it's not

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:49,550
going to waste us somewhere else and

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:53,230
that brings finally to the part about

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,080
how we need a source that problem and

00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:00,379
Queenie says some

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,069
these considerations when it comes to

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,409
writing one is when the custard state

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:12,020
and we're trying to follow it across the

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:14,389
state but they're just they're not

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,909
following every state of the cluster

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:20,180
which was trying to convert by and state

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,919
in Onomichi so every you get between

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,509
machine update events you see in a

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,879
corrective them and you just try to

00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,000
adapt across the food but you don't

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,610
guarantee that you're going every

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,270
rotation of the object it's just you're

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:41,500
going to at the end research and and

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:45,289
this when you think about how to use

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,000
control over the state and react on the

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,400
state of the caster because they have

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,879
any member if you use the custard and

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:59,860
they can't process every state and had

00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,860
some very nice medications

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,410
and then you're horrible after you've

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,180
listed own fonts we start watching for

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:51,500
changes of the committee this isn't very

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:59,980
nice what in the beverage you did not

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,980
think in the duster and start watching

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,840
that's what the what's the what's

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,140
function we use this and when you look

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,140
at and

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,000
maybe pause virtual machines will be

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,220
sentenced as an extra curviness

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,310
inches

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,920
let them you can specify its electors

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,730
women that happen to say my controllers

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,920
you just care about but in the city Game

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,760
Informer's not all those in the cluster

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:57,800
start with you and then you enter this

00:10:45,760 --> 00:11:00,640
which this first step now hey now I get

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,570
all the events coming from echo Sora

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,180
why would just think that eventually

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,490
like the cool and super business was now

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,210
based on those events and that's not a

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,880
very good idea

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,130
first of all controllers can have more

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,990
than one resource then it's hard to

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,750
combine of the events properly because

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,160
you get from research alien event for go

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:27,410
G or octave X and from resource P you

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,720
get in event for three Y and you don't

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,740
really have a place to coordinating to

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,310
look at them together

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,590
the second thing is this what is my

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,180
enemy tried mechanisms or anything so

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,610
they're really just do it one thing but

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,590
they're very good about a meaning events

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,529
of changing faster and showing you which

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:51,939
resources of the night

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:54,879
here to do and Ruth grading in control

00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:57,519
of this is revisionist or dispersed in

00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,029
now help you by taking the land into

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:08,759
this witches resources and and film

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:08,759
different stores and now you have

00:12:41,830 --> 00:13:00,770
these spaces isn't so here I'm trying to

00:12:45,560 --> 00:13:03,400
get the open spaces and I can see the

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,400
basic inference

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:40,880
fetch the state through the telescope

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:44,100
and we women use the store to and which

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,930
takes the piss Porsche and the store and

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,940
make sure that the Miss porkchop takes

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:54,480
the store for you and the context and

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:59,250
these contexts are aware segments and

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,010
updating context and whenever in events

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:06,150
I mean from the dispatcher it will try

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:10,470
to come back here is a very interesting

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,650
cycle a Chevy form does not guarantee

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,570
that when any night is coming in in the

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,570
context Africa thank you

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,879
so when and this Porter cafes the store

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,790
and the children woman in most contexts

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,279
it will for instance for the Edmonton of

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,649
the penalty president and it will

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,139
provide you with the object which was

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,050
triggering doubt it provides the same

00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:45,250
injuries thank you're not guaranteed to

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,660
see that the object state which was

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,199
coming impediments or tournament is

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,170
prettier in your callback we've done

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,420
federal is very intimately that we hated

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,189
this it's not that hard to move without

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:03,649
expressing so there can be two or three

00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:08,689
very fast updates in the same object and

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:11,209
you can medical facility so enemy that

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:13,129
allows the context where invoked after

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,199
the first of the interpreters come in

00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:18,740
they need time to do updates at the

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,899
medium of significance updated but the

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,220
convex relativity move very first event

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,220
yet so

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:44,889
in the and and you have to say

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,309
everything already trying to acquire the

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,079
lock

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:52,300
give deference again the the other which

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,449
is the doctors pervert short amount of

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,360
time doesn't get along so you would end

00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:00,550
up with reprocessing over and over the

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,939
whole thing code but never pay your rent

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,430
Josephine salon and that's example this

00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:10,300
makes it very short

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:12,640
imitation gold particular decisions I've

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,060
been put in touched it at the same time

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:21,640
at the next piece as you can see the

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:24,100
home base here the so there is a game no

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,730
place to do every leader in the subpoena

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:30,730
statement an overly feminine train like

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:34,090
what you can do now is you can use the

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,840
convex commit you thinking of the object

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:43,090
is changing to approach you and the / q

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,630
is family series which affects you at

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,630
first glance

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,210
but it has if you optimizations which

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,990
make riding for 30 minutes first witness

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,720
and I'll show you details after went to

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,490
the disco miss business if you get my

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,620
updates to the same object

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,320
there were collapse into one energy so

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,640
you don't enough processing every

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,749
mutation it just

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,749
[Music]

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,630
[Music]

00:18:28,110 --> 00:19:02,250
and in history

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:35,370
but you already see the difference when

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:38,880
you're ready and adversity again then

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,390
that's perfectly valid but you the

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,049
result

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,440
whose business contains two is so you

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,510
can do it just once and that's all we

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,490
need because we don't since you have to

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,280
catch with the ladies mmm refused the

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,559
Duster you can't even process every

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,450
occupation so you're just interested in

00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,740
protecting okay this to change and I

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:05,100
need to process it and if I didn't get

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,960
process it it's good enough to trust

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,520
them in our present its pros they don't

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,220
need to might be represented by time

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:16,770
doesn't meet and exceed penetrated in

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:21,750
the same way the cube also makes trooper

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:26,210
unit usually develop our processing the

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,210
CP in parallel but sometimes

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:35,480
you try you know the air every percent

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,190
which would create my boss and and and

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,620
you have to update on the replica set

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:49,550
for green even wants to insane three

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:51,530
times person and then victory in an hour

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,200
against both are trying to work on the

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,540
changes and also trying to create value

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,990
for you and and your 10 watts and then

00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,990
over time

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:26,060
get nothing out of the few orders and

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:36,100
with you only if you are done with

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:42,560
processing and and now we get to the

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:45,350
very very end if you are getting if he

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,140
orders you and you're processing it and

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,330
unit errors do wannabe processor but

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,300
nobody nobody v8 they reprocess it or

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:58,900
put me first annual energy forces it but

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,900
not in phase oh we're done yeah

00:21:59,970 --> 00:23:07,010
so then and finally managed to do

00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:08,870
successful process processing of

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,910
thanks for coming over this easily so

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,660
that the Shepherd's country depended

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,660
gets going

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:28,760
and not wear it in because now all this

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,230
components became a controller and the

00:23:28,760 --> 00:24:03,670
controller uses the dispatcher in

00:23:30,230 --> 00:24:03,670
informal and and distort in to other

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:13,279
[Music]

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,049
[Music]

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,580
[Music]

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,080
to expand to the process and they can

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,399
really continue because the between

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,520
instead of factory

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,210
whatever and depending if something was

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,210
a successor

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:13,680
perfect to go engines and those in which

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:17,010
we and so here the list fortress are

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,850
really just there for updating source

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:29,370
don't even try to direct the events

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:31,710
these two new stores

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:41,160
okay the lead state of the nominal trick

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:46,500
and don't try to focus with a single

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:48,960
reader mathematically implementation you

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:54,270
don't need access to the box so don't

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:57,000
try to do that then copy objects from

00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,990
the storage for you that mentally when

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,880
you get an object from the store you

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,160
just get a reference in the case you

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,950
could directly Prince is taking a fall

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,900
out manipulate hit and one oxygen on the

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,730
cluster you of mutating the cash but

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,020
think I should calculated based on the

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,020
state of the cluster interface

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:27,180
some performance generated and when you

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,690
do strengthen former statistical facts

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:36,170
or doing a business logic just you'll

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:40,430
spend four or five vertical changes and

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:44,700
finally that's a very interesting one

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:47,240
don't normally like the object with the

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:55,200
specification it stays in one place so

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:57,630
don't try when you place it everything I

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,430
said it should bring back was don't try

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,560
to implement it the way it is in our and

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,800
nitrates by spots where immediately also

00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:09,060
update my status today but you will see

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,100
that your compound will start to go up

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,590
and down random pretty much randomly

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,820
because the email will be just didn't

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,450
make recognize that you have created

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,430
that part and it doesn't yet know that

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,380
there are five new possibly maybe just

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,679
his three possible ace updates because

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:28,279
the next ratio

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:34,629
so this Vegas would just be a very

00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:34,629
