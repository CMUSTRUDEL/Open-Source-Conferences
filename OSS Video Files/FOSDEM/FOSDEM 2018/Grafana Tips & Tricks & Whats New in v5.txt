	00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,540
next up is talkative Ravana the plan for

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,400
the talk is that it takes roughly 20

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,950
minutes so that we have ten minutes were

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,349
extended Q&A session after that

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,140
so these if the clock is over if you

00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:36,149
could please stay seated let's remain

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,149
quiet because otherwise nobody would so

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:52,600
well but we don't have a person because

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,940
they're Disney color questions when I do

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,300
these talks

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,850
my name is pork belly of the world

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,649
perhaps the company behind the project

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,140
and supporting the project and also

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,890
trying to build services and products

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:14,280
and performance and open source

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:17,640
monitoring and efficient tool to Hong

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,570
Kong gap looks something like this and

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,270
you build the White team or the

00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:29,979
enterprise think people are scared of

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,259
donkey eyes actually might use this in

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:37,350
the demo better in this room because

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:41,500
something all the lights beautiful

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,600
dashboards of grass and other panels the

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,979
graphic hello in the chorus owner before

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,430
events of the powerhouse panel now is

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,439
women get a show of hands in here every

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,820
photo when you're actually at some point

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,820
that is come on a vision

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:07,799
okay that's good to know

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,300
I was hoping for as well and anyway you

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,819
might have known some some of this of

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,819
fishermen have a few slides on the

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,400
history and the goal for the project

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:21,930
this is a bonus for 20th of mine for

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,360
years ago now and almost for four years

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,840
in a week or so and since the first

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,400
release and at the time I was really in

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,670
love with graphite from time series

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,620
application that fixed at speed and

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,540
glide Kanellis really so feeling that

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,120
they're adaptable a solution for those

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,700
tools or we're lacking and I was also

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,959
brilliant so enjoying using Shobana

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,060
the chapter and a really nice without

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,459
putting for long so I took these prints

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,430
from that and start working on the phone

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,890
and initially they won't support the

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,620
graphite over time we added support for

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,040
what other data sources like get Fox TV

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,829
open these TV communities which is the

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,370
condition completely and the massive

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:13,170
search and make me the most and support

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,829
for my sequel and espresso making query

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,570
or sequel data directly from the color

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:21,060
we also have some beyond these are the

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,280
core data sources that are component

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:30,690
actually about cloud morph is also a

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:35,310
core business but it's successful in a

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:39,180
way we know it is not suitable for this

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:44,340
conference and you also have video

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,680
sources or plugins and panels apps and a

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,329
community power there's a repository on

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,700
there already made a sport understand

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,700
this point it has not existed for four

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,280
years and during that time we have seen

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,530
incredible mountain road sign conversion

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,910
- we had some very basic southern

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,540
recordings of offensive scheme of

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,120
version for Ronnie so the last three

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,730
years seen how how many different

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,739
servers actually running the track down

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,889
goes back to see how many are actually

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,160
using the software and of course the

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,620
real numbers so I don't know 130,000

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,290
reporting services no servers but of

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,530
course it's more the finest places for

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,169
me because one people turn off the

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,300
recording down this box is missing the

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,419
season how how this tournament has

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,169
progressed leaders estimate that the

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,630
trend is also increasing Indians own in

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,910
velocity become exponential wrong and

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:50,419
format is supported Capone is amazing

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:53,669
and it's so salsas can be there this

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:56,550
domain where there's no competitors but

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,280
also think that this beneath

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,430
observability including some monitoring

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,330
tool tool has also increased with admin

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,500
of the more elastic infrastructure and

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,380
micro services and more complex

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,000
application touching environments the

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,190
need to build observability tools and

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,010
and monitoring tools has also increased

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,560
so the first inviting that way as well

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,380
the initial pure installation is amongst

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,710
in - growth in their open source project

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,800
in terms of the blinkers from

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:36,110
unsupportive occurs and the companies as

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,370
well and you're also growing the 14

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,449
months from one

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,389
three people - seven people Rosa Nastya

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:48,900
got launched their community site to

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,850
help some users and developers be

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,070
successful as before now and it's

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,850
actually along were like to support this

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:59,010
ministry we support so many data sources

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,919
and most of the pictures are related to

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,310
me of course how you were eating this

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,870
and are recording that so and off to the

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,190
community after also helped the best

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,470
because it's a cause they won't work for

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,199
important to actually answer some simple

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:21,690
questions how to coordinates the sea or

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:24,030
important the CV or create this anyway

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,389
pretty committing and go to that project

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,010
it's also really great components that

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,680
can be used so many in so many different

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,570
domains and circumstances and most of

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,970
the companies that use it also very cool

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,889
and they use it for different things and

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:44,300
a couple years ago we saw the space

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:49,710
exhibition in general Samantha the first

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:53,639
when I saw you can be my date but it's

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,110
just come along you should use the

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,750
one-on-one plication monitoring and

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,000
infrastructure monitoring event written

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,599
application analytics was also being

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,060
used for true I cannot be counted when

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,030
they put sensor in the grounds and with

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,639
the fertility of a small island or he is

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,300
it for so in the industrial sensors or

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,580
human invention systems and I mean we're

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,430
gonna use it to monitor the availability

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:27,599
of teachers in there and exhibit hall

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:33,870
yeah let's see now to their milk intake

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,340
port hello we'll jump although they mean

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,789
to to the phone and since most of you

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,680
are familiar with it

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,930
most of it all the demos we're going to

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,530
do

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:49,360
listen v5 so a lot of some a lot of

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,509
things has changed in d5 in terms like

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,190
this we can feel and we're kind of move

00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:57,669
move your sheets a little bit so don't

00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:02,800
be mad but hopefully all the machines

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:04,750
are gonna be so for the better as a

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,889
second ago about building dashboards or

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,780
both of these solar panels and that's

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,910
how it's changed I mean nothing has

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,610
changed beyond this someone in your

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:22,060
exchanges and the basics of the follow

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:26,020
you add these panels you jump into edit

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,729
mode and you are clicking to the metrics

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,310
tab the metrics tab is different for

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:33,430
each type of data source so in this case

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,580
I'm using graphite and I get my graphic

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:39,070
perimeter of the Wall Street to explore

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:45,029
the metrics available in graphite and

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:47,200
was I follow metric I can apply

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:52,589
transformations without two minutes of

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,589
graphite transformation functions and

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,990
options for the graph panel but I mean

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,420
that this is this is nothing new

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,709
particular for them for their refineries

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,050
I just go down those walls Coppola or if

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:13,390
you have seen the one before you kind of

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,580
each each panelist on this isolated

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,170
thing that you write the metric Croatian

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,810
and in show data but there are ways to

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,600
build more dynamic - ports as well that

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:29,290
use something that's called them called

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,060
template variables that allow them to

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,209
build more dynamic dashboards where you

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,270
get these come across those at the top

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:41,580
then also do so quickly change the scope

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:45,670
of the data for for multiple panels

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:49,990
anyway back to why the show I talked

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,399
about also be 5 and the biggest thing

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,350
that in

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,199
let it a couple of big things but the

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,850
biggest thing that I'm working on some

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:03,769
really excited about this the new brake

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:05,420
system when it comes enables before in

00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,600
your phone it was kind of clunky to move

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:14,779
pounds around great layouts yeah all

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:18,199
that company so now I'm 45 you have more

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,120
important layout system where panels

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:24,319
move out of the way when you resize them

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,449
and it's a lot easier to move panels

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,069
wrong but the most exciting thing is

00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,309
that it's going to enable more way up

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,839
tight so you can have males like this

00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,230
wasn't possible in front of before

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,670
because everything has laid out in rows

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:43,399
where each with a good height of each

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,319
sub panel needs match so you couldn't

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:55,189
have a really high vertical panels on

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:58,100
the side anyway so I'm going to excite

00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:59,689
about not only is it more of these

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,209
attributes and build a sports that's

00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:06,319
going to enable more types of laid out

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:07,910
Wilson new types of panels because now

00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:11,480
we can actually have parallel stuff

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,220
stretched vertically like this so the

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,899
next thing that I wanna do is build when

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,769
you move this back panel that also

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:21,350
disrespect a lot of metrics vertically

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:23,029
which is something can do with single

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,100
snap but it's very inefficient with

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:30,850
extreme stuff panel requires separate

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:33,740
queries so that was the new grid system

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,709
the next big thing that I want touch on

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,850
this is the new exchanges so we change

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:43,550
the decide when a little bit and also

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,910
multiple of the pages have become new to

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,639
them have them nothing I think super

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,269
interesting here weakest users might be

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:56,269
so excited that we have a search in

00:11:53,269 --> 00:12:00,170
there fulfilled because they have data

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:03,319
for businesses along rises it's mostly a

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,399
span exchange but also Jesus so you can

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:07,540
navigate around the interface

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,819
easier and it looks a lot better but

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,189
more so maybe meaningful the exchange is

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:17,089
that the dashboard sense means has been

00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:19,850
now combined into that a unified view so

00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,170
you don't have to switch these views to

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,139
a drop-down anymore so you can now

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,610
access annotations a section of a

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,100
through the comp company is not

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,470
comparables

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,029
merciful history and we can restore

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:39,019
different so all the versions of a

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:43,549
dashboard but so that's neutral in new

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:45,319
units it's a new capability the biggest

00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:48,589
thing that they were working on for it

00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:51,019
feels like ages this folder and that

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,810
sort of tough work folders because has

00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,730
been one

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,529
Bradon feature request new other ways to

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,720
organize the Lawrence proponents

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,810
relations and groove dashboards among

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,670
team lives or application lines so

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,940
previously to do that with the tags

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,310
attacks people think they want some

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,120
taxes enough of a tool to sort of

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,040
organize dashboard so that's why we can

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,740
introduce folders which allows you to

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,710
some expanded collapses and these

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:28,140
regions or sections go silence forward

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:31,830
and recent at 42 discharge and the

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,160
folders can also be managed or without

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,839
forcing delicate advantage to this new

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,430
separate pages which allows you to sort

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,110
of do something and it's a quick

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,110
administration of that what you can do

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:46,260
move the action move move

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,540
multiple dashboards or delete multiple

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,790
dashboard and it's also from these views

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,560
that you can administrate sort of the

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,860
folder permissions which is also a

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,960
completely new thing of 185 and that you

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,270
can access and permissions or homeless

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,280
animal dashboards and of course you set

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:06,089
the permissions on the folder they will

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:15,180
be inherited by the dashboards that they

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:17,730
contain so I can review that quickly so

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,040
okay the commission system is a pretty

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,240
in specie than a quizzes on teens which

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,800
is also a new thing in d5 ensure that

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:31,290
safety but you can have some activities

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,690
on the user of the user as well and you

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,709
can have permissions on the team and if

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,780
I go to dashboard a discontinued so then

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:44,000
it does to have permission as well and

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:47,190
then they get their missions inherited

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,540
anything so they don't override full

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,600
admissions but you can override the

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,600
default so wrong based permissions

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,420
as a 17-second vegan instead of things

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,060
that we are adding in the file

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,590
mostly knowledge they're only there for

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,670
which assistant to make it easier to

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:11,500
manage manage the Commission's right now

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,840
we only have wishes on folders and a

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:20,320
sport of the hook tap into two data

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:22,990
sources as well so lastly there's one

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,180
feature that it's mention is for the

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,810
demo because it's a back-end teacher for

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:32,310
a penis it can also be appreciated and

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:35,080
it's interesting in a way that's

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,590
commissioning system previously nirvana

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,180
when you created new data sources or new

00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:51,780
dashboards it had to be done through the

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:51,780
UI or to the HTTP API which or

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,320
and it's gonna be simply city of

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,970
communities or anything so and just pick

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,070
up the phone and have your beta sources

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,810
and your passports all over there and

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,160
it's all some active sitting so if you

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,310
change the from disk it's going to be

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,620
through the you have to have to respond

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:34,950
to father for that change to be picked

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:40,790
up so that was kinda the defining

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:43,110
feature highlights and I will have a few

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,700
few features that I would highlight as

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:55,769
well that I will show everyone come

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:58,950
aware so annotations is a very own

00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:08,780
feature in component that allows you to

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:11,100
overlay overlay which I want to show

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,900
okay annotations is no freaking

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:21,140
component that I want to overlay these

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:24,079
events on graphs could be anything

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,480
before in your follow we had to set up

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,850
an initial query that affects these

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:36,990
events from a data source like

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:39,809
elasticsearch could that contain they

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,669
dint data so what we couldn't do was

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,860
create these events from within the UI

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,780
and that's actually something you can do

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,880
starting from B four or five I think it

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,360
was when we introduced this feature so

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,820
this by holding down command on a Mac or

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,850
ctrl on Windows Linux you can there's

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:01,710
open there add annotation view and so

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:04,860
describe describe an event and of course

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,700
this can also be motivated and down to

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,730
change the API to create these and these

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,620
are stored in the photos on database as

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,970
we don't have to sell this

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,720
well what else you can do this actually

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:29,130
and if you do the same thing but market

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:32,790
region is a region annotation and write

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:35,340
the description and the tags here are

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,860
kind of important in that it will allow

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,860
me to show this and then another

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:44,340
dashboard and faisal subscribe to filter

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:47,700
for it so now say this if I don't go

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:51,870
back to this new grid dashboard I can

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,660
have an annotation query from home to

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,210
this and say I want to look at all

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,180
annotations and are created in the form

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,180
of database with a tag outage and

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:15,360
hopefully if I come out should see so if

00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,100
I tagged it I think them to create these

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,710
annotation quarters a lot of dashboards

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:29,760
and actually show them on a conditional

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:34,980
basis I mean I'm complaining briefly

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,750
before what you can do here beyond just

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,340
so using some variables to create the

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:43,530
dynamic dashboard statistic and also

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:47,040
have confirm a repeat peril and I was

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,720
new in the files that can apparently be

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,200
repeated in the vertical direction not

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,480
just horizontally so in this case this

00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:00,000
singer stuff catalog is being repeated

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,400
for each value on the final and you can

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,410
have there's also a concept of roles in

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
robotics is still there in d5

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,100
is slightly different but if anything

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,100
else amplifon I repeat on Rose

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:21,410
in a template variable so ii must come

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,720
to Crixus is showing you can use style

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,960
overrides in the graph to really

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,420
customize for your grass look in this

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:36,350
case I'm showing network traffic in and

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:40,040
out and I'm showing how metrics on the

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:43,490
bottom from negative actions and when

00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,980
Linda is using a display override saying

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,890
all series with the name out in his name

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,250
should be a separate stack group and

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:56,000
should also be transformed and this

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,310
slice of a negative y-axis there are

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,280
other new spaces forces style riots in

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:04,610
the African savannah really customize

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,760
how we finish series should be displayed

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:12,890
you can say Ã¬okay connection display

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,300
click there with any line film or the

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:20,570
state should have points as I could to

00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:23,330
say this should not have a deadline

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,180
someone we can really compromise work of

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,580
your graph using star wall rights

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,430
there's also a cool style overall

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,730
brightness from fill below to and allows

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,530
you to to film a region between two

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,840
series which can become useful with

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:44,300
young min and Max in average because

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:47,660
more and more can region that pretty

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:51,460
much covers most of the so my demos and

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,460
I wanted to be some time for questions

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,389
oh yeah sorry on and up here I

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:13,759
mentioned this there so get out on

00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:15,259
Monday we have for for Thursday

00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,220
but since we're going to go to them and

00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:26,509
come yesterday what kind of cricket and

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:31,149
Monday and there's people we hope to

00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:31,149
review in three weeks

00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:49,970
so when different labs apprised posted

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:52,190
metric services services for for both

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,429
component and metrics and of common pain

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,120
remedy driver and they also have support

00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,120
services and and training and another

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
source

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,170
very good question

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,660
so the perpetration with this new grid

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:35,500
system that introduced in the 5-1 cook

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,120
them how old all backward for with that

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,730
new system because the positioning is

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,440
completely different so the answer is

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,100
that you hold outputs will work just

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,480
fine and they will perform the part of

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,240
migrate them to the new positioning

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,280
system so it should look closer and

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,580
people with slight differences in power

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,100
high because it followed before and go

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,340
back you can send panel high and row

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:03,040
height to per pixel level but the new

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:09,940
system there is a kind of snap so we

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,140
cannot accept the height of powers so

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,900
when it's going to be slight differences

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,250
I also recommend you to try again the

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,070
better you have to update the plugins

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,430
because panel plugins could have some

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,230
issues with the grid system we try to

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:29,080
suppress with most of them but they

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:30,250
should find but a few might and the

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,410
biggest thing that will keep in mind

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,290
though is that if you change you say the

00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:39,880
back or 85 and for imported in before

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:41,050
it's not going to work when you can use

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,610
the board again

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:47,610
so they can downgrade mister system

00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:12,870
so provisioning of dead birds and so can

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:14,550
you provision yes I think yeah the way

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,350
is that's my bonus is that this power

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,300
and very provision dashboard is you

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,280
specify a special power where the

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,590
dashboard from the power of this and

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,040
then it is fire for the name as well

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:53,730
program when we you why that's important

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:57,630
creative because when the panel's

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,580
position monitoring and as though normal

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,740
restructuring ropes it's more structure

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,740
so here's a question of panels and their

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,900
position so the structure of the month

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:23,790
of the Jason is is slightly different

00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:25,590
but it small space we have this one big

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,590
change to have been touched on because

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:31,440
it's kind of a master before us with the

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,510
IDS for Kadapa today for the dashboard

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,820
half they've changed the menu around has

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,830
changed and this is something we worked

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,990
with honor yes last minute in this

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:44,010
relate to the provisioning systems and

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:46,650
also before before before back on back

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,590
to this slide is this unique ID for

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,390
dashboard and the spike is visible time

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,130
already shaped switch the name of the

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,370
dashboard you break all the links that

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:59,400
that dashboard

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,170
emails or links in slack those things

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,880
aren't gonna work in the morning renamed

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,090
dashboard and we felt that was a really

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,280
bad experience and also kind of positive

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,330
to the positioning so we moved that

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:15,830
unique ID and something ID something in

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:19,830
your realm and we can tie the - go to

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:38,700
even partition change their detachment

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:42,360
name so that's kinda why the - it is

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,360
supposed to be API is not focus we can

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,040
provision users or organizations and

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,960
teams through the provisioning system

00:27:47,040 --> 00:28:29,809
cap it's something we then talk about

00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:34,320
Roberto - ah yeah correct we don't have

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:36,840
any ways we have written any way from in

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,050
Great Commission the delicious system

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,370
with on-site Commission system so he'll

00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:47,610
that or so all these conditions are

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:50,100
something that's only right now but we

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:55,610
will probably look into some some way to

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,610
to sync these with outside sources

00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:15,000
yes so sorry schematic sort of to

00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:17,429
provide some features so everything in

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,070
the pars compacta back to the dashboard

00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:22,320
in the database like this from a

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,049
40-caliber engine maps for the largest

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,090
kind of tied to the dashboard ID at they

00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:30,720
notice ID so there's a bunch of features

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:34,289
that require the dashboard the database

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,029
ID but the math book what is cool with

00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,769
the provisioning system both the data

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:41,519
sources and dashboard is that you can

00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:44,309
walk down anything from the UI so so you

00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,639
can control that so this data source is

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:49,440
not so the master they listed the five

00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:52,880
and the provisioning system you don't

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,880
