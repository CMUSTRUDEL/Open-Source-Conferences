Oh

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,599
okay

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,039
[Music]

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,879
[Music]

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:25,980
Hopper's after don't allow in system

00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:29,100
programming to again debate iodide has

00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,100
talking of

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,490
okay

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,830
[Music]

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:25,200
last time that is saying a boss I say

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,549
2016 that 2 billion they're not that big

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
of a shock I think that many more I

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,940
think they want people to move to the

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,329
bigger scheme sorry to be bad

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:42,660
but a lot of the mountains and places

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:45,629
for eating Apple starts to China sake

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,790
bites where the HDMI component in back

00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,290
but as long as you know they are which

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,599
means you want to bring closer together

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:58,049
to represent okay so commies must be our

00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:02,819
solution is to compile of targeting

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:05,790
receiver Gnosticism astonishing Impala

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,239
because being nervous about currency

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,239
stand

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,929
[Music]

00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:03,229
Texas's Indiana innovation because this

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,379
architecture can have a very into

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:09,229
architecture and of like this some

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,990
destruction that using access time it

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,699
now satisfactions of the some registers

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:19,509
other distractions have taken up

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:26,870
different job titles I ended tragically

00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:29,529
this mismanagement in stuff that you see

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,529
I remember

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,490
actually you guys

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,009
[Music]

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:30,690
- I hope it will vary

00:07:42,400 --> 00:08:03,590
okay you can see next day on which as a

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:05,870
defense manager account and if you see a

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,800
book a little bit about five to ten

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,800
percent in those few years back or not

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,930
this body is a pathologist in its

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,090
performance and here we have said I

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,020
stopped the comic it is a benchmark and

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,630
we see the SBCC here and I was on to see

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:28,070
five zero three seven zero and

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:30,320
essentially on the last two this course

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:38,210
and that we know that for most of my

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:40,690
stuff and so thanks to Baba just I don't

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,690
understand

00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:08,360
good now in code size yes we move to

00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:16,129
make the 10th time span Yahoo across all

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:19,309
backwards that is resonance they're

00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:21,170
really good concise and some things but

00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:28,089
if you don't get to make thick compared

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:28,089
to those compiler darkness yeah

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:36,500
which is not good as kind of all kinds

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,130
of votes the dynasty is now yeah the

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,720
lesson to see you don't hit compiler

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,780
advanced we talk about my existence kata

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,130
actually has also joined in Linux event

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:52,220
but they monthly yeah analysis is called

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,050
the investment sometimes wonder what was

00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:00,100
even higher custom you have still

00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:00,100
involved and they are

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:12,170
okay so much for the seasoned adult

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:17,630
about - human thoughts about LEM -

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:20,100
basically yes energy on the veterans

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:25,260
obviously particle Indians or set the

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:28,740
object you have to see how that is you

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,170
see this allows us reduce our language

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,170
shortened other languages at sea and

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:42,290
but the thing is vitamin deficiency I

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:48,220
think those on the idea I mean the code

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,220
output on this area Dawkins is special

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,079
okay

00:11:16,389 --> 00:12:21,999
yeah devices internal charlatan

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,230
No

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:46,689
relaxes quality rate support and a lot

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,689
of them appealing

00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,400
that only allows on target

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,979
[Music]

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm still an athlete

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:12,100
that our government has most exemplary

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:15,560
okay feel free but about the particle is

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,240
now this because of what we exceptional

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,430
no stick me

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,380
boy it looks the antisymmetric this is

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:27,290
simple is how 2006 it definitely is

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:32,949
attending to various artists in Maryland

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:37,449
the family support available job objects

00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:37,449
now CIA

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:49,660
[Music]

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:52,310
so one week look at the artist Ashley

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,530
Ibaka supporters

00:13:52,310 --> 00:14:01,840
again using

00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:09,070
of the aucd's apart that okay now what

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:42,040
God said to him I mean the packing both

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:46,420
yesterday and okay we'll use the

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:52,090
symmetric steam above this day ever but

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:58,800
a lot of smaller cheap travel all of

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:58,800
them become well so this is a glass

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:21,570
ah yes sir I'm rocking it and there's a

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:25,839
spot to hot cabbage and cons of the

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,690
party also only why he needs a family

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,240
community

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:34,120
okay so let's what was it to the list

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,370
well what's just intended to be done I

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:41,370
mean SBCC means for developers mr.

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,370
Warner

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,289
[Music]

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,570
Mott's what people expect these days

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:11,810
that Jesus here idea the more

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:19,100
combinations to be done the PCC food

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:21,980
chain polymerization for the baptism

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,580
there and you get the guys soon as I

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,040
mentioned most of the tips I need to go

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,360
place now this is of significant

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,240
actually for the lien time of my

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:40,550
existence of course some people might

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:46,700
come over and quite a human type of

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:50,950
wiring systems SDCC the worst acompaña

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,690
and the big systems writer or something

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,560
chiaki us out of the divided for masked

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,520
Avenger

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,520
so there one who have to make posters on

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,520
and

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,230
okay

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,490
yeah that's molly to attend to make that

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,620
now hold it this visionary ought to

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:22,290
be gotten better days in cold science or

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:25,460
the okay so I'd say that's it for my

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,460
slack Thanks

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,419
yeah

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,740
well as you know we need more doctors -

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,809
it's okay what connection was also what

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,340
does it needed a hearing to cement the

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:56,370
architecture okay now see ten schools

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:58,669
naturally compiled an audience

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:04,070
especially thanks to go on to sustain

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:06,899
the crowd they won't call that teacher

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,789
instructions or easily function calling

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,970
and the training all understand the

00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:15,269
moderate we might refer callers access

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:18,179
as an AP for example and quality talent

00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:20,010
actions are you need to go why are you

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:30,799
in the exact system i have a point that

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:30,799
you can stack of bangle yawns or

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,919
aspectology

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,279
hunting mode or even how they have to

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,470
like okay can sleep well you somewhere

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,340
at some of the act and then put it in

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,990
context actual style and also when you

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,090
action structure the variable of the

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,610
stack and for the peaks for darkness

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,649
even have a half gasps text a quarter

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,309
don't remember who you are our second

00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,309
half mistake

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,650
if you're going beyond for heaven's

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,590
function called technology move things

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,200
around that you don't have books about

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,780
tension morning

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,960
yes the event passes to the passing

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,890
moment offset the most function that

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:21,720
suited up it has activities for the

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:32,200
relative addressing now it's efficient

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:35,440
to see the time when she saw contact

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,550
attraction so most infractions vector is

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,550
going to be

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:28,090
because yeah

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,710
[Applause]
