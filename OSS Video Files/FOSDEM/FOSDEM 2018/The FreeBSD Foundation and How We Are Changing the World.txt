that aren't right now so who's here for

00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:23,859
open BSD okay a couple of people and

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:26,680
then net BSD okay and then just in other

00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,240
reasons that you might be here for and

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:36,600

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:39,820
reasons this setting horizon Oh

glad we could fill that for you okay so

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,770
what I'm gonna do is so starting with

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,590
this is our mission

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,289
it's basically so the foundation is here

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,219
to support the FreeBSD project in

00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:02,219
community worldwide

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:12,020
oh okay so how far are we allowed to go

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,020
[Laughter]

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,099
and so okay so if I want to see my slide

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,160
so I might want to be more over here

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,730
okay so I'm gonna start with a little

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,920
bit about our history and so sorry I'll

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,470
kick it off with a short little story

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:35,250
and it starts with it's back in about

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:37,680
1993 and a few decades ago and a young

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,410
college student was at University of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
California at Berkeley and was a

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,980
computer science major and got a summer

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,510
internship at a company called walnut

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:54,150
seedy walnut walnut no wind river is

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,209
Wind River back down should probably get

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,709
my story straight and and so was

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,390
introduced to free BSE and and had some

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,110
good role models who are actually

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,840
working there at the time and and so

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,889
some of the original starters were

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,290
founders of previously we're there and

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:19,319
and so in and then in the same year in

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,299
1993 he was actually asked to join the

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,359
the core team which is the core team is

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,970
sort of like the top level or they start

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,819
they sort of oversee the project they

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,190
help with developer relationships and

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,870
issues that might come up so he was

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:39,989
prior that team and and at the time so I

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,010
think it was a walnut walnut cd-rom is

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,340
what the company was called

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,639
and they wanted they owned the freebsd

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,370
trademark the logo and and the word

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,530
freebsd and so they wanted to hand it

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,349
off to the project and let them own it

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,200
and the project just was an organization

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,420
made up of volunteers and so they

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,010
couldn't really take ownership of a

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:08,700
legal property like that and so so this

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,209
person his name is Justin Gibbs and he

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,810
so he had bent so this was actually so

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,620
this was in 1999 so he had been with the

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,639
project for seven years at that

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,070
time and he was now he was graduated he

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,960
was grown up and he was actually in a

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,080
serious relationship and was considering

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,449
marriage and looking in long term having

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,180
children and not being able to volunteer

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,550
as much as he was able to on the project

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,699
and so they started investigating how

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,310
could we own this this IP this trademark

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:46,690
and he started looking into nonprofits

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,520
and came up with the idea of maybe I

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,190
should you know the way I can give back

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,340
to the project is to start this a

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,100
nonprofit that could actually own the IP

00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,240
and but and also continue indefinitely

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,330
to support the project as a legal entity

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,350
and so he actually started the FreeBSD

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:12,250
Foundation and it was in 2000 and and

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:17,710
the primary you know goal of it was was

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:21,550
really to own IP and so we were this is

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,940
working right or UPS so we were founded

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,550
in March of 2000 so we're almost 18

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,669
years now if I could add correctly in my

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:37,780
head and we're a 501 C 3

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:41,440
so you'll there's other foundations that

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,440
support open source projects and there's

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,380
in the bsd world you have the net bsd

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,110
foundation the open BSD foundation but

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,020
you also hear other ones like the Linux

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,960
Foundation and one way that we're

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,330
different is that we I mean a good

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,050
comparison would be the FreeBSD

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,669
Foundation and the Linux Foundation and

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,639
because since we have similar names that

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:09,490
people might think that we run very

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,830
similarly and we are actually a public

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,199
nonprofit and our whole purpose is to

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,380
serve as a public charity and the

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,190
support the FreeBSD project and whereas

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,800
the Linux Foundation is a 501 C 6 and so

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,169
it means that there are like a trade

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,630
association and so their primary purpose

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,360
is to support the industry the

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,220
commercial users that

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,470
the actual corporations and that's why

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,930
you'll see that they have members and

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,310
the numbers pay usually pay quite a bit

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,120
of money to become part of that

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,250
organization and so even though we the

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,590
only way that we're sustainable is by

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,680
also taking we take donations and that's

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:54,870
what allows us to to do the work that we

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,729
do and we're in so we were headquartered

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,740
in Boulder Colorado in the United States

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:03,449
and we actually just moved to Longmont

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:07,289
which is the next town over so who are

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:10,110
we and so we we have a board of

00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,599
directors that govern the organization

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,520
when we first started back in 2000 we

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,400
had three board members and it was

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,069
basically just two that's what you

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,779
needed in order to run a corporation and

00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:28,860
so so you may see some familiar faces

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:31,710
here and so just uh Justin Gibbs is the

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,740
one who founded the foundation and he

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,979
still supports those he's part of the

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,139
board and I Benedict rustling he is that

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,259
he's here he's actually helping run the

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,810
freebsd stand downstairs and then we

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,750
have board members who are located all

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,639
around the world and then the people who

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,889
actually do the work of the foundation

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,770
is this is my team

00:07:52,889 --> 00:08:00,389
and so you see me up in the upper left

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,719
hand corner and and then many of you may

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,740
be familiar with IDI mast and he

00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:07,409
oversees a lot of the software

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,050
development that we do and we're support

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:13,259
and then a lot of the technical work

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,940
that we do and and then a whole team of

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:20,639
people that support different efforts

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:23,099
that I'll talk about so with our purpose

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,310
is really to help make freebsd you know

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:28,440
the best platform for any use that you

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,319
may have from commercial users creating

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,360
products to schools from universities

00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,120
doing research and also teaching the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,260
freebsd to people who are who want to

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,310
play with it on their computer and

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:46,570
play with it and use it really so so

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:49,750
that's that's what we're here to do so

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,850
what we support you for getting the

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,220
thing is down here so software

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,960
development we have software developers

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,540
on my staff and and then we do actually

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,190
do a lot of advocacy and education and

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll go into more detail on each of

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,880
these we also have people that are part

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,730
of the security team we have the release

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,550
engineering responsibilities we have the

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,760
lead release engineer on our staff and

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,320
then also we support the FreeBSD

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,110
infrastructure which that actually means

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,760
that we buy the servers that are located

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,710
around the world and we also maintain

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,630
help maintain them and we'll upgrade and

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:35,020
then we provide technical leadership in

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,180
in different aspects from it might be

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,980
add who facilitates a lot of different

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,320
calls which it might be storage it might

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,180
be graphics and in just different areas

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,810
of the operating system support and

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:50,440
community as well as helping with like

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,750
coming up with better improve methods of

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,850
maybe release engineering or some of the

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,750
different different teams so that are

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:02,230
part of the FreeBSD project and then we

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:06,070
and then our beginnings is legal so not

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:09,160
only do we own the FreeBSD IP but if the

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,040
core team needs any legal help and

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,730
usually that might be in questions on

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,620
patents it might be NDA's just questions

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,740
that they may have then we will provide

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,240
legal guidance for them so we don't have

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,940
any lawyers on staff but but we do have

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,980
some lawyers that we work with and then

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,720
the Lessing or face to face meetings

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,300
that we support so this would be one of

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,060
them were so well yesterday we actually

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,600
had a freebsd developer summit and we

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,820
had 22 people who attended that and we

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,190
started at nine we went till 5:30 and

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,990
it was a long day and we actually got a

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,140
lot done we basically sat in a circle

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,060
and had many discussions and I felt

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,210
there really productive and so it's a

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,850
great way to get people developers and

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,860
contributors and or and people who are

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,410
just interested in learning about the

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,550
bsds and previously to work face to face

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,050
to talk and to come up with ideas and I

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,270
think that's where you get that passion

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,540
that energy and then you carry that back

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,270
to wherever you're working or located so

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,540
and then it also includes meeting with

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:23,870
commercial users and finding out what

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,690
what their needs are and also what we

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,580
bring some of those those needs back to

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,770
the community on these are things like

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,270
maybe features that they would like to

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,240
see in FreeBSD so we bring that

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:38,570
information back so going into more

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,390
details so some of the OS the software

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,630
the operating system approved nuts that

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,670
we we're currently working on we have so

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,300
like I said earlier we have internal

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:53,390
software developers on staff and and so

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,980
that's on the bottom part of this chart

00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:01,450
and then the we also do outside projects

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,810
outside funded projects that we might

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:08,480
project manage or they actually maybe

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,480
have a like a technical facilitator

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,400
who's outside of my staff and who's

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,450
managing those projects and so right now

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,900
we have open ZFS project that's

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,420
currently going on some Wi-Fi work

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:27,530
that's laying the foundations for some

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,390
continued work and and and so anyway so

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm not going to go through each project

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,130
here it's but to give you an idea of the

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,610
work that we're doing internally as well

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,890
as funding outside of our internal staff

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,110
says we are pretty small on the bottom

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,560
though that's having the team of people

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,750
and we have well we have two full-time

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,840
software engineers and then we have

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,160
other people that can jump in and and so

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,070
some of the things that we're working on

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,180
right now is like the current security

00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,910
issue that everyone's aware of

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,690
having a team they're able to actually

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,960
quickly jump on this and and help

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,610
mitigate and put in some change you know

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,020
fixes workarounds whatever we need to

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:16,620
get changes out and and keep freebsd

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,210
secure and stable so it's really helpful

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,880
having people on staff that you can

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,760
actually say you know please

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,340
go work on this as well as providing

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,740
technical guidance to you people who are

00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,720
also helping from the project well so

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,450
one thing that I didn't include in the

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,060
initial slide of my staff is we actually

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,560
have interns on staff and so I don't

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,030
keep their pictures because we were at

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,000
eight three interns every four months

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,950
and so they change and this is up in our

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Kenny we actually have a Canadian office

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,450
and so we keep two interns on staff

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,820
there and every four months we get two

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,170
new from the University there and we're

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,200
real and we're looking at growing that

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,880
program like in Boulder we have a local

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,010
University and I'd like to bring in some

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,180
insurance from from our local school and

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,310
but it's really nice because we're

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,620
working on something we may be talking

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:10,680
about how do we implement how do we

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,840
support this feature and there will be

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,020
various ways that you can implement this

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,850
and and so it might involve maybe doing

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,860
some initial testing and so it's great

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,750
because as we sort of process this and

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,680
we'll be on call since we're all remote

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,540
and and so we'll have some ideas and so

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,780
just like putting in a you know a hack

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,660
which isn't really the the FreeBSD

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,550
philosophy will actually put the interns

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,230
on to run the test and so they're

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:42,750
they're learning and they're actually

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:45,030
contributing and it's it's great it's

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,310
really a benefit to us in the project to

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,530
have these people on on our staff to be

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,910
able to go jump in and do this work for

00:14:49,530 --> 00:15:00,000
us as far as FreeBSD advocacy so the

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,410
FreeBSD project had a market like a they

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,340
had a marketing committee to have many

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:08,250
different committees and and what we

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,560
found was that yeah they weren't able to

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,660
really respond

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,970
very in a timely matter plus yep most

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,620
people want to develop and contribute

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:25,639
and either software and/or documentation

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,829
are just different areas and so I had

00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,870
brought on a marketing person to help

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,899
not only us but actually mostly help the

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,910
project and so she's full-time and she

00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:38,079
really looks at I mean almost all her

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,009
work she does is for FreeBSD and it's

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,990
and so from the list that I have here

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,839
areas that we've really expanded is

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,589
getting out to more like conferences and

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,829
events so this is a great example that

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,959
we have more people here we help so even

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,579
though we're the foundation did not well

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,819
we got the the stand that's downstairs

00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:05,829
and please make sure that you stop by it

00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:08,420
at but we try to get local like FreeBSD

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:11,089
contributors and volunteers to come and

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:14,540
help promote FreeBSD and same whole

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:16,309
purpose is really it's to recruit people

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,930
to the project so people who are like

00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,819
her coming in and they might be

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,620
interested in learning something

00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:23,720
what does FreeBSD what are the BSD s

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,980
which one would I even want to be

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,040
involved with if I was interested and

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,920
and what's the community like too so so

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,449
but so I always see it as like two main

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,500
purposes when would be recruiting new

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:42,410
users and contributors and and the

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,120
second would be to get more users of

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,699
FreeBSD and so it may be just an

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,589
individual he's going to try FreeBSD and

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,930
play around with it or it may be a

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,209
corporation who is going to use it in

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:57,800
either a product or product development

00:16:53,209 --> 00:17:00,220
or even in their data center so so

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,290
anyway so as far as cava crisis we've

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,089
we've stepped into some new regions I

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,760
went to China last year it was pretty

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,470
amazing as far as what the useless

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,640
theory we wouldn't even know as a

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,000
project and because they have their own

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,059
forums

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,860
mirrors and everything and so so it was

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,579
really interesting the find and then in

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,980
in Africa and Singapore that we've been

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,559
reaching into and that's giving

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,780
presentations on FreeBSD and it's also

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,200
giving workshops on FreeBSD and we're

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,990
and we're trying to get more volunteers

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,150
more freebsd contributors to give these

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,970
workshops and presentations and then

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,340
another thing that we do is we publish

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,710
the this is the FreeBSD journal and so

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,390
so we always print hard copies when we

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,400
come out with a major release so and we

00:17:50,390 --> 00:18:00,020
have 11.0 done we print so actually it's

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:03,620
a great magazine Utz it's professionally

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:07,630
produced and it's it's actually a great

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:11,330
way it's to get information about yeah

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,160
unix-like operating systems but as well

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,419
as writing articles yourself and

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,130
contributing and so it's we have a

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:22,669
professional editor for it and so it's

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,530
very well done magazine so please make

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:27,890
sure that you take one if you don't have

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:31,760
one and and but otherwise it's digital

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:34,580
there's a little copy so is anyone here

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,910
in this room actually get the journal if

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,309
I see one okay for you Pete nouns okay I

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,919
hope like maybe eventually like everyone

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,320
there it will Reiser Hannah so-and-so

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,090
but please make sure that you take one

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,090
from jiangsu and well we have a few up

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:55,880
here too and and then just creating more

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:59,120
advocacy material and that's from just

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,669
handouts on what does FreeBSD and why

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,160
should get involved with the project and

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,710
if and then how you get involved with

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,110
the project and so we have this material

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,720
that's available for anyone to either

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,220
print off of our website we will ship

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,620
things to people too we have stickers

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,440
and and pens and things that when you do

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,510
meet ups or maybe a hackathon or user

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,760
groups that you will we're happy to

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,059
provide that type of material to people

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,220
and lasting at training education we

00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:30,020
were trying to help grow the amount of

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,480
curriculum out there and working

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,430
internally on workshops

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,010
and one reason I want to bring it in

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,560
turn in locally is to put together some

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,290
introduction workshops to freebsd so it

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,450
may be for technical people and it may

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,310
be for people who aren't technical and

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,070
just to expose them and educate them

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,570
about freebsd or even just uses a

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,420
platform so there are people out there

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,060
they meet each like I don't know website

00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,940
design and it's running on FreeBSD and

00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,890
so it's a great way to you're teaching

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,920
something else but it's running on this

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,980
platform that it works and and so

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,260
hopefully people will be curious about

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,420
what previously going forward on that we

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,020
do have a demo downstairs on our on our

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,840
table

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:19,250
it's our Raspberry Pi 3 running FreeBSD

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:22,760
I set that up and it's a fun little toy

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,640
to play with and and so I always

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,720
encourage people who like to do that

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,190
type of thing

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,440
I like hardware and so I love playing

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,140
things like that so so anyway go go

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,100
check that out some of the upcoming

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,870
events I just I included this slide just

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,100
so people would see some things that are

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,930
coming up that to go to - some of these

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,670
are ones that maybe you won't go to you

00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:56,180
but they're like fuzz scales a great one

00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:00,530
in the west coast of the US but like

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:02,990
apricot in Nepal we will be there and it

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,550
but in India your cough is a great

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,680
conference these are once more for it

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,810
regional that we really try to get the

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,330
people in that area expose them teach

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,090
them about FreeBSD but other ones like

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:18,230
the the actual BSD conferences like me

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:22,460
PSD and euro BSD con which will be these

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,830
are actual dates in Romania and we have

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:29,060
we have this information on our website

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:33,080
to ended' and then another area that we

00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,390
support is the the security team release

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,470
engineering and the infrastructure and

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,790
these are some of the things that that

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,490
we're supporting I think the biggest

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,029
thing is it with release engineering is

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,289
having someone full-time on the

00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:54,629
and aware of what's going on and and is

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:55,919
available to either fix issues if you

00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:59,669
know coming out with new release if

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,519
there's an issue and and trying to keep

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:04,229
on top of when the next release should

00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,419
be and we were working on trying to

00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:09,089
improve that process to and then the

00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,219
security team actually Adam asked who is

00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:13,859
on my staff he just joined the security

00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:17,009
team he's the the deputy security

00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:18,929
officer and so so now we have someone

00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,599
who's actually paid he's assisting the

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:24,749
security team and so now it's gonna be

00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,009
very beneficial to the project so I'm

00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:29,009
going to try to speed up a little bit

00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,619
more so I have more time at the end but

00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,049
and then like I spoke about earlier the

00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:36,149
face to face opportunities and it's from

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:38,419
those conferences like your OBS econ

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:41,219
which I would encourage people to go to

00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:43,829
but we also have travel grants that you

00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:45,869
go to apply for and so if you want to

00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,089
attend when these conferences but you're

00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:50,189
strapped for for money you can't afford

00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:52,049
to travel there your company's not

00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:55,019
sending you then you can apply for a

00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,369
travel grant through us and and if

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:02,509
you're approved then we'll help you with

00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:05,309
your expenses so some of our plans for

00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,589
this year is to help with the testing

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,809
and quality assurance more automated

00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:12,509
testing and we're hoping to bring

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:14,249
someone on staff to help with that we're

00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,169
gonna have a university ambassador

00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,659
program so we're gonna identify the

00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:20,309
university especially this year to get

00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,649
started and we'll have representatives

00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,479
at those universities that will run

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:25,529
meetups and will also provide that

00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:28,049
material for them

00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:31,829
and so just to get freebsd and more

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:34,109
universities and then and then if you

00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:37,379
work for a company here and we have a

00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:39,379
partnership benefit program and so what

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,789
we're working on is getting more

00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:44,009
corporate donors and working on

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:46,379
partnerships with them and so it means

00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:51,299
that we just provide more support for

00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:52,619
those those corporations and pretty soon

00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,119
the more of material and that's that's

00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,329
one thing that I'm personally involved

00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,130
with so anyway so are we changed in the

00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:02,100
world and when I first started

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,539
with the foundation and I'm running a

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,759
non-profit and you always think of a

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:09,149
non-profit is something that's feeding

00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,370
the world or you know we're nonprofits

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,960
doing doing something that's good for

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,809
the world making a positive difference

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,740
and so I'm so I'm running this this

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:21,870
corporation and I'm thinking um we're

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,940
supporting Netflix and you think of

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,429
these large corporations who are using

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:30,240
free BC and benefiting from FreeBSD two

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:32,340
and and and I knew that well you know

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,490
our purpose is a nonprofit is them to

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,980
make Netflix more money but I also saw

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,129
that by helping make FreeBSD a bus

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,379
operating system it's and by these

00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:45,240
companies using it it actually shows

00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:47,100
that sort of validates the work that

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,210
people are doing that's very important

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:55,679
and it sustains the you know the product

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:57,330
the operating system so but going even

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,250
further than that I was really just

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,289
thinking like what-what are we doing

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,230
that's making this world a better place

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:06,149
and why you know as a non-profit how are

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,799
we giving back to the world that's right

00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:13,350
so I listed a few things here and so I

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,240
think that like the biggest area I see

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,429
and everyone's gonna see something

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,740
differently but really having this free

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:21,509
operating system that anyone can use and

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,490
so if you're interested in systems

00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:24,840
programming or order you're interested

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,039
in understanding operating systems that

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,440
you can't just get the source code you

00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,990
need to look at it when I was in college

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,740
which was quite a few years ago you know

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,740
I didn't I have that ability I mean it

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,139
was for open-source was available and we

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,090
couldn't we didn't look at source code

00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:45,629
knows we were developing it ourselves

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:48,509
and my first few jobs were with

00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:50,450
corporations that we I mean well I

00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:52,620
didn't I was on the software develop

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,360
developer I was a firmware developer so

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,370
anyway but it was all proprietary stuff

00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,279
so anyway so you can actually you're

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,840
taking an operating systems class and

00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:03,360
and you can actually look at what else

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,490
previously designed and if they really

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,080
thought it was such a great sign why you

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,029
know why and you can look at it and then

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,860
you can check implement your own code

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:12,330
and you could try it out and say there's

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,820
a cool feature you on

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,799
no matter you do it and so you're not at

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,720
a corporation where they're telling you

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,399
exactly what you have to do you could

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,140
try something and maybe no one else is

00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:26,179
interested in that but you could try it

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:28,679
yeah and you know and you can commit it

00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:31,640
so anyway there's a lot of opportunity

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,340
for learning for growth and you get

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,760
really real-world job skills by doing

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,640
this so so not only from working as a

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,690
team member collaborating with people

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,909
that was one thing that we were doing

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,789
yesterday was collaboration on another

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:50,450
example was someone who who was

00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,679
interested in the area previously and

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,750
decided no one was really leading this

00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,080
effort and so he said he decided he was

00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,100
gonna take this effort on and so it

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,850
meant that he was going to be the

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,710
project manager for this this group and

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,220
he didn't he didn't have that experience

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,350
of being like a project manager and so

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,480
he was actually asking for guidance and

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,250
our meeting yesterday and I thought it

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,740
was actually a great example of someone

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,480
if you're at a corporation especially a

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,600
large corporation you wouldn't have that

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,130
opportunity you would really have to

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,090
grow into that you're you become a

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,830
leader at first not as the actual like

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,440
leader you grow into that with having

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,110
those skills and so you could you have

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,139
this opportunity to step into roles that

00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,269
you see are available and take that on

00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:42,090
because because most people are

00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:44,039
volunteers and so and so everyone in

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,710
brief was like thank God so-and-so is

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,590
taking this over and let's help him and

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,000
you know and maybe he'll fail but even

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,159
if he does he'll learn from that

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,740
experience so so it's a great way to

00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,450
really you know work on things that

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,409
you're interested in to take on

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:03,840
leadership roles and to grow into

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:07,110
becoming a leader in the project or in a

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,510
particular area and and that's when and

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,760
so that's our freebsd offers and the

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,500
foundation helps by we're supporting all

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,549
these different areas that i talked

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,559
about earlier so and then the last thing

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:23,039
really is just the fact that just like

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,809
the Raspberry Pi I have downstairs we go

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,900
run on these really expensive they're

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,450
basically like you can

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,050
chitters and we can go into impoverished

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,340
areas and people could to get the

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,620
operating system for free they get a

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,360
very inexpensive computer it's something

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,640
that maybe we could even provide for

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,110
them and we could teach computing skills

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,830
and people who could get those skills

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:50,200
and so so it's provides this free this

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,260
free product you don't have to buy you

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,300
know Windows you don't have to buy you

00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,290
know a proprietary type of operating

00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,610
system so I know I don't have much time

00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,550
but I was going to have a Q&A session

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:07,210
and so I have like a minute and a half I

00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:09,640
have like a minute but but also I was

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,620
just going to say that you know I'll be

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,420
here for the two days and so please come

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,580
up to me if you have any questions I'm

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,020
here to actually support the project and

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,720
so anything that we could do

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:29,770
that's I'm here to find out I do have a

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:33,790
question in the back so what is our view

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:36,160
of a like commercial support for FreeBSD

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:41,740
and do we want to change the direction

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:44,830
or the challenge at well so we would

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,930
love to see so we would love to see a

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,880
company out there are people consultants

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,590
out there who provide support for

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,860
FreeBSD if that's what you're talking

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:57,630
about like a Red Hat type of yeah the

00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:01,390
foundation we have thought about yeah we

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,100
we meet all the time we talk about what

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,280
we could do first to get more income to

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,750
help us and but also how we could

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,520
support the project better and that's

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,010
something that we do discuss and that

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,820
would we would have to change in order

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:19,360
to do that but anyway it's we would love

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:22,510
to see people or a company support

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,440
FreeBSD companies do ask for it and so

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:31,660
it's I I see it as an opportunity and so

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:34,120
but my times up and so but I want to

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:37,270
thank everyone for being patient sitting

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,950
through my talk and and I think having

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,520
the opportunity to do this but police

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,110
approach

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,490

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,490
like to talk about thank you
