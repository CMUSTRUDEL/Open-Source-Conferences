[Music]

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,130
[Music]

00:00:28,990 --> 00:01:17,810
[Music]

00:00:31,300 --> 00:01:20,120
- 2016 coolest tricks in this slide but

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,410
that's what got me into most of my

00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:30,020
troubles and where I started of course

00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:32,740
with Linux and darker and was a way for

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,740
me

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,700
[Music]

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:17,260
okay is it better just in a funny way

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:20,710
favourite I'm yeah I started Linux doc

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,070
who was away among other things for my

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:29,709
system to be clean and my audio apps to

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:34,950
be only only apps on the host almost and

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:38,080
it basically it basically avoided

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:42,850
dependency health as most of the

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:47,530
software is not on the host so I showed

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,600
up after euro busy and it was in Serbia

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,160
which is where I come from so it was on

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,950
my doorstep I had to go and I obviously

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,370
it was a good conference on the freebsd

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:05,890
user now and I have FreeBSD one of my

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:08,080
machines so it was successful the

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,970
freebies 11 came away at the doctor

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,800
support and I thought there was gonna be

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,959
a champagne and then celebration and

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,540
whatnot or nobody talked about the

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,239
doctor and that was kinda weird

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:27,850
so re-examine my assumptions maybe

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,420
darker is not the best thing in the

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,360
freebsd world so that research and

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:41,140
research told me that i need a different

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:51,580
approach as lucas earth linux has one

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:53,530
set of features so you have to do it

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,610
that way because those are the features

00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:03,800
you can use that or nothing right and j

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:06,230
ended up ended up in my head

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,190
it's also a security feature it's not so

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:12,050
easy to escape a joke compared to the

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:20,470
doctor actually I don't know anyone who

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:24,010
escaped the tail FreeBSD jail I was

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:29,720
really mind blown once I realized that

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:48,190
jail can have other jails Wow it's all

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:52,160
the way down so I was first using it for

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:56,240
for a hyperspace I co-founded so it

00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:02,330
wasn't quite production yet for me

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,680
although the CBD is I don't know if four

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,230
years is old

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:14,870
but for a manager for I think it's it's

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:17,060
mature and I realized I have to learn

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,800
some stuff how it's done

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:26,930
it's not darker composed anymore so it's

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:31,070
really pleasantly surprised is how easy

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:36,860
it is to start with CBS D so we have

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:40,430
this construct construct is basically

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,040
what creates your jelly if you prefix it

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,850
with drink so they construct visual

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,710
drill but if you're new black hours you

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,930
have no idea what to drill actually does

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,340
then how to connect it to a network and

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:59,720
what is available there is a dash to e4

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,980
I recommend so it's I'm gonna show it

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,390
how how it works

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,390
that is a dialogue based

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:16,580
and you're into stuff and it does the

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:19,400
magic it's for me it was easy they're

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,160
changing the first layer will create

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,530
what you want or maybe you made a

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,240
mistake

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:32,870
it's a consistent set of commands

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,180
between jails beehives and then of

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,870
course you cannot run everything because

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:44,750
of the technological reasons but still

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,430
we really really try to to make it well

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,630
I don't like to use my brain when I

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:57,700
don't have to so CBS Deus is helping

00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:01,340
also supports nodes multiple nodes

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,920
virtual machines for very matter

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:08,020
whatever you want to use for I don't

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,750
know for example yes and all

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:15,500
communication between J's is based on

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,470
SSH you can if you're logging to any

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,750
node and Tollett okay I want this drill

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,150
in this node and I don't know where I'm

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,520
logged in and I don't care it's gonna do

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,400
the right stuff for you it's gonna send

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,310
a command to the right node and set up

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,900
network if needed and all the stuff that

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:42,070
actually managed that managers should do

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:45,110
and I'm still trying to grasp all the

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:51,950
networking technologies built into

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:56,720
FreeBSD and me not having to well read

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,820
about them but just run the command like

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,220
to command and it will tell me what are

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,010
my options and if I choose some options

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:13,580
there are sub options it's much easier

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:15,020
for for loops for newcomers also this is

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,639
basically

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:24,569
deconstructs - it looks like and while

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:29,780
it says here is a profile I'm gonna talk

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:33,209
about that more later basically you can

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:39,240
have different stuff based on a profile

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:41,820
and the rest is basically the self

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,940
explainatory except if you don't want

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:53,010
anything like an F this twink it's a

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:55,230
zero empty string is kinda hard to shell

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,220
script so it's easier if you have some

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:04,200
value like a null in in thisaway

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,959
we chose zero and the rest is pretty

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,029
much self-explanatory with this being

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,100
the drop-down menu where you can choose

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:21,720
an interface to to stack your gel into

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:26,540
and basically all three commands cover

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:30,680
basic needs for isolation management of

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:35,040
networking staff of Wallace rates of

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,029
whatever you see be the sorry whatever C

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,709
beers they can do

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:43,140
it's basically commands and tell

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:50,040
commands for fear of them that are most

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:59,220
important so once I was happy with how

00:09:50,040 --> 00:10:02,070
are you used it how it works for me not

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:07,390
happy with small bits and pieces I want

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:11,290
it to be perfect for me personally and

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:15,460
that CBS the implementation is really

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:19,450
hard to tweet so for example if you have

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:22,390
a CBS DJ construct you're gonna have a

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:28,140
script called J construct it's gonna be

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:30,910
total / to you construct but when you

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,850
experience to operate the CBS then you

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,590
know where to search for implementation

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:41,950
of the command you just ran and it has

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:49,630
really minimal amount of seeds basically

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:52,030
for Treme oh and some aromatics that we

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,180
need in a short script so CBS D comes

00:10:52,030 --> 00:11:00,160
with its own shell script to to manage

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:03,400
the commands but it's like 99% show I

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:10,720
mean pure shell it has the same syntax

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:17,910
and we didn't invent anything also to

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:21,760
make it as minimal as possible when we

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:25,360
dependences are involved so it really

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,990
has minimal set of dependencies I think

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,780
on a clean system package install will

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:35,790
pull any 11 packages something like that

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:41,800
the implementation changes and we

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:45,430
released we can have released new

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,420
version so that might be a lie I haven't

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:56,500
checked the dependencies of a new

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:59,300
version so things might change the

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,840
tension supports

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,410
advanced features you can help hooks

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,620
which basically foil when you start and

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,930
stop a jail inside or inside the jail

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:18,050
we're on a host or pre post stops for

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:22,070
blood like a bunch of hooks that will

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:26,480
help you for example I like to register

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:30,110
my girls in DNS for using a hook but you

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,990
can use it for anything you think it's

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:43,100
it's appropriate and it has profiles has

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:46,520
I promised and profiles for what if you

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,280
have CB is the set of commands you can

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,970
put an arrow in a profile and this here

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,750
in Jake instructs to the dialogue you

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:01,280
can just choose the profile and okay

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,950
create it so you can put all your common

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:09,050
stuff in a profile so you don't have to

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:14,720
type at a time when automated were some

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:18,340
other tool profiles also include nothing

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:26,810
polluted they use skeleton for jails

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:29,180
which one example I use it for its I use

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:34,190
a lot of development in web development

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:38,080
in angel and I 101 commences is rotating

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,830
in a drill so scale creates my

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,780
development user inside a jail and

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:52,580
whatever it means from packages for

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:55,520
configuration and stuff and when I

00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:01,640
joined the project which was I think six

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:06,190
months ago as a developer I try to make

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:11,000
we use existing infrastructure more

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:13,250
because it can manage your firewall

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,250
whatever firewall you using it can

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:21,790
manage your ZFS datasets it can manage

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:25,000
your net and what a lot of things are

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,660
automated just when you create a drill

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,470
that old timers not not that I'm one of

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,230
them but more experienced FreeBSD

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,000
administrators don't like magic and

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,190
actually our administrator doesn't like

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,870
magic so if you have existing

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:48,200
infrastructure that was kind of my my

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:52,640
job to make it okay what if something

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:58,070
else or you are managing your own PF how

00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:01,790
do I stick CBS D into something existing

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:08,120
now that's what I was mostly interested

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:10,720
as a as a developer and I think we're

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,060
getting to a point where you can

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,840
literally use it everywhere by taking a

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,900
tour with a grain of salt because as I

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:26,620
said I'm still green I don't know what

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:31,880
everything means in FreeBSD so this

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:35,330
little Friday's are for what we did to

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,320
support beehive well basically when

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,760
you're building a manager you're not

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,950
inventing anything you're using their

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:51,320
existing stuff and this is not not

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:54,680
homeless I just picked a few that I find

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,100
interesting and especially PCI

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,690
pass-through for driver development or

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,690
whatever you want to use it for

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm packing some some small hardware

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,420
source I

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:19,130
kind of love it it has a word Conway

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:24,110
adoption of plan 9 virtual p9 photo

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:28,040
sharing which is abnormally fast it's

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:31,310
not yet in it will come out where the 12

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,750
but we have support for it already in

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,880
place

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,180
[Music]

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:44,350
yeah you can we can basically do all

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:48,170
kinds of stuff with it but what it

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:51,350
provides for me personally when I took a

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:56,870
beehive to a network a it can be a

00:16:51,350 --> 00:17:00,230
network that also some jail uses so you

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:05,770
can interact between Jason and beehive

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:08,810
in an easy way and we're planning on

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,260
besides one switch to support open

00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,610
research that's coming really soon I

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,150
hope

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:21,890
if if I were free tone remains as it

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:27,290
they say it's coming soon social Disk

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:31,760
Management currently when we only create

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:36,890
a fool zero so we want to experiment

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:40,010
with shallow ice cold when zero doesn't

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,970
allocate whole space but other kids when

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:49,540
it when it's not

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:53,360
Thanks so that's for the Beehive also

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,030
for zero I think it's a minus s to add

00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,740
but it's more of a testing how it works

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,720
in in some of the environments now for

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:08,330
the Jeff it Stella there's a giant

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,840
manager I think I think I say I think is

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,409
because

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,490
ix origin or tour for CBS d so i came a

00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:21,360
bit later and i tried in this six months

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:24,750
that i'm developer to get as much

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:33,840
information on history of CBS day as I

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:38,750
could so drill has is a list of features

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:44,250
that we support right now these are I

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:48,120
find them interesting data encryption

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,659
reg wire jelly that's that sounds sweet

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,270
that's something that if you're on a

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,140
shared hosting you probably well you

00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,480
don't have a CB leader then burner

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:04,020
sharing a machine where total people

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,360
while your juries encrypted is kind adds

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:15,440
to the security I'm not gonna go through

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:20,730
all this the V is already in our CTL

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,299
virtual traffic economy goes to infinity

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:28,440
[Music]

00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:31,010
like this basically the what food is

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:36,390
they can do with the journal is

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:41,490
abnormally flexible and of the things

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:45,390
I'm really really long is this I haven't

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:48,750
tried it excessively but having a build

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:56,510
in a jail that's gonna become an image

00:19:48,750 --> 00:20:00,600
for ISO or a mistake that's perfect and

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:04,860
basically you can have a VNC hina in a

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:07,049
day so supportive and whatever you know

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,529
probably whatever you know about the

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:14,850
jail is supported even for example the

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:17,630
image is twelve current feature but it's

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:26,940
already there and

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:29,880
it kind of works the EHC client has a

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:37,430
problem with even so that's the reason

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:41,600
why it's kinda and then okay this is the

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:45,690
demon skill slide for two reasons first

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:49,080
the support then we need harder and it's

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:52,020
not easy to come by a hard word that is

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,170
just okay we're just gonna put this box

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:58,530
in a corner and we're gonna develop our

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,850
design on it and you can you can do it

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,120
on your laptop

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:07,830
compared to behave in jail so Zen

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:12,630
support is slightly lagging behind jails

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:20,240
in beehive but I might be lying because

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:23,730
Alec who is team lead more than support

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,290
two weeks ago and I didn't get the time

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:31,230
to check it out what's in there we got

00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:35,700
two weeks of someone's horrible to do

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:41,300
whatever we can redesign so I not yet

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:44,970
sure what we did with that but basically

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,210
Johanna and be how you can create and

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,930
destroy them hook them to a network and

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,680
the rest is easy

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:56,970
the rest is up to you log into it and

00:21:51,680 --> 00:22:04,560
whatever you want to do just do it and

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:07,830
we'll stop there there is a web

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,620
interface to CBS D which is currently in

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:13,440
alpha version so it's a slightly

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,050
annoying to install we're working in on

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,800
that becoming actually I want to work in

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:25,460
that becoming package install command so

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,460
we don't have to hassle so so much and

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:36,210
what basically distribution does is

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:41,190
fairness is a it should do everything as

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,370
CBS the command line CBS d does and it

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:48,420
should have of why I say should it's an

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:52,500
office offer we plan on whenever you do

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:56,430
something for mercy why you should you

00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:00,600
should be notified web interface right

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:06,270
away so some web sockets are behind it

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:11,720
behind and whatever you can do with CBS

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:15,060
d you should be able to do with with

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:21,920
telling us but it's gonna change

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,920
slightly I'm gonna come to that slice so

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:29,340
sorry I'm just gonna run through some of

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:34,050
the screenshots of the of the destroyer

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:38,580
and how it looks but if you wouldn't

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:43,980
expect much like fill in the fields and

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:50,070
create or edit it but very close is also

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:55,790
on energies you can use that our

00:23:50,070 --> 00:24:01,170
pre-built Sibley has exported sorry

00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:05,790
export and import of jails actually

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:10,740
Jason beehive by I'm gonna talk mostly

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:12,930
about the gel from now on you can pick

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,830
some of them and just say ok I don't

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:20,280
know how to install something from the

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:24,290
West Was Pickett fan is it will be in

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,500
your network on your host well you can

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,350
peek into the

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,640
jaleswar beehive and I think this is

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:37,090
behavior it's a bootloader you can pick

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:42,880
into it and this stuff currently it's

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:46,870
VNC by the ORAC poet spice I think a

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,690
month ago so we're going to try how the

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,169
spice works with with the gels and

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:55,890
beehive and maybe switch depending on

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,890
what we find

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:05,010
and yeah there's a list of your networks

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:08,200
that you use with with the CBD they

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:13,200
normally have to be alone same network

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:16,240
and it can manage multiple for example

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,220
local images are not even necessary

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,700
interfaces or bridges or whatever you

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:32,770
need so this is a list of following

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:41,980
networks that are configured and this is

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:44,520
small so this basically is CBC doesn't

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,820
have a concept of a user

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:54,940
it doesn't care about that but if you're

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:57,280
delegating work among different system

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:03,610
administrators you probably want user

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:06,549
names and authentication so the web part

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,179
has authentication but command-line

00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:12,150
doesn't

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,150
I think SSH is just fine

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:29,190
finally what's in the future the future

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:33,029
is bright because has got some attention

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:40,759
lately that's why I could take snapshots

00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:43,830
a screenshot and it will become more I

00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:50,610
can say easier to install and easier to

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:56,779
use over time but up until now we only

00:26:50,610 --> 00:27:00,629
had one alpha release so it's pretty

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:04,320
edges there is a Seabees difference

00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:06,409
which is if you're a web developer you

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,450
know that the web form is basically

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:14,669
key-value where it allows you to do what

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:18,869
Alec does with that is humans

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:23,129
likes puppet I like ansible so she

00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:26,399
remembers some of the puppet variables

00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:31,230
saying into the CBS deforms and then

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:36,559
when he wants a puppet show seriously

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:40,289
has a feature to run a puppet now it was

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:44,009
gathered information from the those key

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:46,860
values by the way we use a SQLite to

00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:51,419
store our information so it's really

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:57,419
light you can whatever you find useful

00:27:51,419 --> 00:28:00,090
to be variable for maybe all your gels

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,289
for example you can put it in in there

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:06,840
and there's extracted and put into

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:10,039
playbook or whatever is covered in a

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,039
puppet world

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:27,230
same idea only trying to use ansible to

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:33,919
provision step to provision gels and Ray

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:36,530
is only bound to two gels I because the

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:41,900
way ansible works virtual machines or a

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:45,740
piece of cake to set up and what ELISA

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:51,679
seen in the future is testing that we

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:57,799
chose to use buildbot it's Python so we

00:28:51,679 --> 00:29:01,490
both know how to to development there

00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:04,100
won't be what we learn in work on is

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,039
multiple instances of CBS d so for

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:14,900
example if you're hosting for either you

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:19,150
can expose your VPS by giving access to

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:22,669
your clients to CBS the instance

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,850
currently only one CBS they can be on a

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:30,940
host but having multiple CBS days maybe

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:33,740
you can host VPS were segregated

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:41,360
differently or whatever you find useful

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:46,270
and what's gonna happen that that effort

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:51,409
is that our work on a socket based

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:55,960
communication between command line and

00:29:51,409 --> 00:30:00,159
demon currently the first quotes that's

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:03,980
basically everything what we wanna do is

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,520
make demon do the stuff that is needed

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,080
for creating a ZFS data set or

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,890
networking or whatever it needs to do

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:18,610
and then you can only killed way with

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:23,620
where a socket and this way I said that

00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:29,050
the web part is probably going to change

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:35,980
to use the socket and to become more to

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:38,110
become easier I successfully broke this

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,460
laptop with Holden base day trying to

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:45,250
support to have more support in CB s

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,670
therefore having busy so that's

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:51,730
something while continuously working on

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:55,960
and it's still under there is some

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:59,800
Holden busy specific general options

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,500
that they're working on I think they're

00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,760
they're definitely master of the github

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,250
I just don't know if there's they are

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:14,080
included in any of the images like all

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:17,950
the stuff that Holden BSD bring so on

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:23,290
top of FreeBSD that can be turned on and

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:25,450
off for a jail and well where they have

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,910
this commit we are just waiting for

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,460
hardened be is dated to actually ship

00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:34,110
with images which may be actually

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,530
happening in these few weeks and

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,200
documentation

00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,890
although the documentation is really

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,170
really good

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:44,070
I found everything I needed when I

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:49,870
started with CB is the in documentation

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:53,860
we need to work on making documentation

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:57,370
more searchable it's a static site right

00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:00,460
now so if you don't know a certain

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:04,180
document is you probably will have hard

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,980
time finding it so a bit of

00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:14,700
documentation management is needed to

00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:22,150
really kick off the in the CBD for noobs

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:25,660
and I have much to add on that

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:34,100
these are some useful links

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:36,590
they're about CBS the first one is CB is

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:42,650
the official site although it sounds a

00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:45,740
bit weird bad business tour for for

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:48,770
images of beehive and gels is in order

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:53,540
so they this the main world become once

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,780
well become pleased for like a docker

00:32:53,540 --> 00:33:01,250
hub or you can pull images from it or

00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,760
build yourself more and get help of

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,990
course

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:11,299
and please do check out the github

00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:14,840
rights issues and stuff whatever you

00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:20,480
find borrowing please just let us know

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:25,010
and the last one is my site I will try

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,530
to cover CBD from weird perspectives

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:37,460
being a musician is just one part of it

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:40,490
and so I'm trying to fit CBS D where it

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:47,360
originally doesn't fit so we can make it

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:51,559
more flexible and friend I would like to

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,860
turn first them for mightiness it was

00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:59,390
well a pleasure to come and talk to all

00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:03,110
these people I would like to officially

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:07,040
thank Allah Ginsburg who is a lead

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:10,280
developer of CBS d for having so much

00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,919
time for my whining why these doesn't

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,720
work how do I learn this and and stuff

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:20,330
he's a wonderful mentor so thank you

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:25,060
free/busy for doing everything basically

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,060
compared to the small port with it and

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:33,170
for last but not least telecenter is a

00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:39,620
hackerspace i co-founded that is hosting

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:42,100
some CBT related stuff namely I think

00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:46,340
the most important is a mailing list

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:49,210
which is kind of scarcity at this point

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:53,420
Bhatia is a new developer I'm going to

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:58,190
obviously become a guy who goes around

00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:05,810
and those people that attend and screams

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:08,870
that people use it use it on my site so

00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:12,280
if you have any questions I will I will

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,280
be more than glad to answer

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:53,420
so the question was can Sybil's the

00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:57,170
separate shared memory and I don't know

00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:00,420
I'm really too green maybe it can but

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,369
it's a lower level I was preparing

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,360
the the slides not so much technology

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,640
sorry mana what a mailing list of here

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:18,210
has got all the definitely those that

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:21,780
they answer no one else it's in Serbia

00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,550
its sorry the question is where is a

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,860
hackerspace

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:36,920
it's in Serbia in a town called Mossad

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:36,920
which is almost under north now come by

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:54,330
is it possible to run seriously and

00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:58,500
OpenBSD no there are no jokes vmm is

00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:02,080
drastically different than beehive and

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:05,230
there was no point we would end up will

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,880
discussed it and we realized we would

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:13,240
actually write the second manager so

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,390
that it has for example dragonfly and

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,320
hammer support so it's it's not so much

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:25,090
freebsd of obviously I'm trying to

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:31,840
expand in a bit but just some non

00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:35,080
freebsd systems or not that I can't call

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:42,360
them not that good but not so fitting to

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:42,360
our needs more questions just shoot

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:11,250
so just to repeat the question eunuchs

00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:14,940
the question was actually there was no

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:17,819
question the signal angel told us that

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,650
it's in a man page so I really didn't

00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:21,650
read shone on me

00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:34,950
can you be a little bit longer human

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:40,140
so the question is are we planning and

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:45,869
supporting GMO there are bits and pieces

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:51,230
the already working for okay let me

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:55,859
start from beginning what we have with

00:38:51,230 --> 00:39:00,690
Keanu Angelus is running and for example

00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:05,460
your laptop running your own based gel

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:08,730
using qmo I know try out I so we do all

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,550
ik posted so I know it's possible but it

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:17,060
didn't get much attention so it's really

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:17,060
really alpha and it means more more love

00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:43,589
so the question is can suppose the poor

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:46,769
manage them to reason I don't know

00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:50,549
sin management in FreeBSD is changing

00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:53,130
right now so what we're going to end up

00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:54,989
well basically it's going to be in 12 so

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,920
if you use 11 and you probably don't

00:39:54,989 --> 00:40:01,769
care about that

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:04,460
Bala ah the best of my knowledge there

00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:08,670
are no pieces of the sand that are

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:13,890
unsupported but take it with a grain of

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:16,410
salt I'm gonna definitely have to

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:20,339
explore Zen more I just didn't find time

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:22,680
but the the documentation is such that I

00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:26,849
didn't find anything

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:37,469
I couldn't you do with the Zen with with

00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:41,569
CBD so we got less than 10 minutes or we

00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,569
can discuss for whatever

00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,370
