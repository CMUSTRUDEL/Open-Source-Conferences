alright we are life welcome everyone to

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,780
the second day of t able to online

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,059
summit we are on to plenary and again as

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,609
the previous us we've got to pleasure of

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,680
being here with Jane Silber Canonical's

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,900
CEO will be entering all of your

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,769
questions related to punto open source

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,599
and and more and the way this works

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,929
essentially is that if you had any

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,020
questions you can ascend directly on on

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,910
the RAC channel on some into that call

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,980
or you can even go directly to luton

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,670
Eircom and there you will find the chat

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,170
widget where you can prevent any of your

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,850
questions with the word questions that

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,660
it gets highlight it and we can then

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,140
pick them up and then will essentially

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,789
pick them up as they come along um I

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,289
think other than that change doesn't

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,300
really need the introduction so I think

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,980
I'll just move to a background and

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,350
latching take over the stage thank you

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,909
David it's a it's great to be here again

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,619
I had such a good time doing this at the

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,479
last slip into online summit that I was

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,390
really pleased when when David in my

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,460
class me if I would do it again so I'm

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,470
happy to answer your questions on any

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,380
range of topics I know there's been a

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,590
lot of good discussion so far in the

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,299
first day or two of this summit we were

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,430
just talking about how there seems to be

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,409
a real air of excitement in the

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,049
community now and and that's certainly

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,280
true with in canonical as well I think a

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,329
lot of the things that we've been

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,640
working on over the last several cycles

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,700
are now coming into fruition into a

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,340
really tangible way I know that people

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,829
are trying out convergence and seeing

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,619
how that behaves on their own devices at

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,240
home I love seeing the excitement coming

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,340
through in the social media posts as

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,409
people try it and have trouble but also

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,189
discover new things to do with it and

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,240
really grasp what what that powerful

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,409
convergence concept can can bring to you

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,880
and of course there's loads of

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,399
excitement around up in tagore around

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,319
snappy of into core with not just the

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,650
devices that people are building but

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,890
also the opportunity to write snaps and

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,400
define the behavior of of that wide

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,920
range of IOT devices that are that will

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,709
surround us in this increasingly

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:31,049
connected world so what do you want to

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,239
know happy to answer any questions if we

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,000
have any or I can keep talking if

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,140
nobody's asked any questions yet

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,609
overhead I think questions are I think

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,980
people are quite interesting people are

00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:45,720
questions are starting to pile up so

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,549
first questions from rich wing can you

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,290
give us some idea as to what month the

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:53,879
convergence phone will be ready in the

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,260
online stores I'm sorry could you repeat

00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,359
that it again I'm sorry let me check um

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,849
can you give some idea as to what month

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:08,519
the convergence phone will be ready in

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:11,129
the online stores um so I will say early

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,579
next year I can't give you a precise

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:17,069
date because it's an announcement for

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,959
our partners to make generally they're

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,419
the ones who ship the hardware it's

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,340
their their phone you certainly can see

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,269
the state of the software and how

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,220
quickly it's developing and our hardware

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,590
partners are following right along there

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,849
so I think you should you should be able

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,340
to expect a device a convergence device

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:43,019
available for purchase in online stores

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,340
in early 2016 but beyond that I you're

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,810
gonna need to stay tuned for specific

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:52,260
announcements all right next question

00:03:48,810 --> 00:04:02,879
comes from Alan Pope or Microsoft by

00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:06,120
canonical Kofi no I know that that's a

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,040
persistent rumor but no there's nothing

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,579
there's nothing like that happening I

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,319
certainly um if there were the abysm

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,479
online some it would be an unlikely

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,900
place to announce it although a fitting

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,109
one an appropriate one but no that's not

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,109
true

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,450
alright so we regret not having to be

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,240
able to share the news but on that note

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,060
let's take the next question from Brian

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,330
Linux in Jane what are your thoughts on

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:43,300
do you want to phone release dates

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:45,490
markets availability etc um so I suspect

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,140
you know what's been released already

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,640
there have been two BQ phones released

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,100
initially in Europe and then a global

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,910
launch for those who wanted it and there

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,100
will be an ish there will be continued

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,080
country-specific launches and

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,750
initiatives following on that on that

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,340
plan we've launched the meizu phone in

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:14,110
Europe already as well and there will be

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:17,230
continued developments there we continue

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,430
to expand not just the range of devices

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,110
but the US and improve the software

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,330
experience on those devices so as you

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,370
know we do a regular cadence of

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,740
over-the-air updates on those phones we

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,300
are trying to satisfy as much of the

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,590
global demand as possible while

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,710
balancing the fact that we want to be

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,810
very clear about what we're selling into

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,460
who we're selling it so we're we're not

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:51,760
aiming for high street sales yet that

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,160
will come in time but that that in the

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,820
shop walk in off the street and buy

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,919
something is a really important

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,600
milestone but one which if you if you

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,460
cross that threshold too early before

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
the general public's ready for it and

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,960
before your products ready for it you

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,020
can get into lots of trouble our focus

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,290
now is in improving the phone experience

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,560
in expanding the range of content and

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,660
apps and scopes on the phone and in

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,930
really driving forward on the on the

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,050
convergence idea so the next major

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,930
milestones you'll see in the on the

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,020
phone itself will be very tightly tied

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,520
to the convergence concepts that that

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,520
you see developing in the software

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:42,229
next question comes from rich wing is

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,779
asking what are your thoughts on

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:48,309
religion and belief system for example

00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:52,639
is open source of belief system oh

00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:55,129
that's a very interesting question is it

00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:01,370
a belief system I think for some people

00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:04,339
it is for me open source is not a belief

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,800
system per se I think openness is a

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:13,089
belief system a belief in openness a

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:16,939
belief in transparency in the value of

00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:20,330
collaboration and and mutual benefit are

00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:23,029
all things that I that I believe in I

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,419
think open source is a manifestation of

00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,699
some of those things I think it is a

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:30,979
it's a very valuable and pragmatic

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:34,009
manifestation of those beliefs it's also

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:38,719
a licensing model it's also a software

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:41,719
development approach but I for me it's

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:46,460
not a it's not a belief system per se I

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:49,699
think that that it is a an excellent way

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:54,560
to to demonstrate and highlight some of

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:57,199
those those core tenets of community and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,939
collaboration which drive the things

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,649
that we do with the Avenger community

00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,409
that drive things that canonical does

00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:11,539
and which I think are are generally

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:13,129
applicable in in today's society all

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,459
right we've got another question from

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,139
unknown face michael hall is asking what

00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,089
the current want to development are you

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:25,520
most excited to see happening over the

00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:28,399
next year oh it's um it's too can I have

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,439
two have two have two the the first one

00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,399
is convergence you know we laid out this

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:37,459
convergence idea it must be four years

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,000
ago now i'm sure someone will correct me

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:44,540
if i'm wrong on that but it up in two

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,019
summits several years ago we laid out

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,720
the idea of of the converged experience

00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,569
and

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,810
and that that vision for the future of

00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:57,540
personal computing and then to tackle it

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,459
we started with the phone because that

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,740
represented a sort of an extreme view a

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:08,910
reachable but extreme view from what was

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,870
the bungee desktop at that time and it

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:15,360
has been um in some ways a long time

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,379
coming when you counted in in cycles it

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,910
feels like we've been through many

00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,009
cycles when you count in an actual

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,870
months on the calendar years on the

00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,050
calendar it's an amazing amount of

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,189
progress in a relatively short time I

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:32,310
feel like the building blocks now are

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:34,980
are solid I know that the code is solid

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,310
I know that the design work is is very

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,990
good and we're now able to put these

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:44,100
building blocks that we've been working

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:47,490
on for so long together in a way that's

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:52,980
that's just delightful then I think it

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:55,290
really is a very exciting time you know

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,550
we we think back to the time for those

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,720
of you who've been in the community for

00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,980
a long time you will remember that

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,750
several years ago we started

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,230
demonstrating these concepts with a

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,269
beauty for Android of a phone and

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,490
android phone with ubuntu operating

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,769
system also loaded on so that when you

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,220
docked the phone in some way you hadn't

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:17,399
have been to desktop and I remember just

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,160
being blown away by that at the time and

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,860
now that seems so clunky you know it's

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,230
so it's so old and clunky and the the

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,930
the boon to experience as we move into

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,660
this convergence world is so smooth and

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,420
so elegant that I think we're your only

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,519
beginning to discover what it really

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,230
means were how people work and how

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,110
people interact with their computers and

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,269
what sorts of equipment you buy and use

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,069
in what scenario I don't think we're by

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,559
any means done with this journey I think

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,870
it's an important milestone on the path

00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,930
I think we'll continue to see a lot of

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,720
evolution and a lot of change in that

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,110
personal computing experience but I

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,279
think we're at the at the at the tip at

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,600
the beginning

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,459
of of that major era of change and I

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,829
think that's I think that's really

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,850
exciting and I think it's very exciting

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:17,370
that the binges right here and I hope

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,339
that that everybody else is excited with

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,269
it that's that's one piece and that will

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,370
be a big focus for 1604 as you guys know

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,779
of the work that is being planned out

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,939
this week and the work that will

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:34,170
continue over the next the next six

00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:38,850
months or so the other thing that I'm

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:41,160
excited about is snappy and a boutique

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:47,660
or and the range of devices that that

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:50,519
are being made there we're the the

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,720
amount of innovation that I think will

00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,509
will explode on top of a ninja Corps is

00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,420
staggering the the folks that are

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,699
building things on a binge accor i was

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,249
already exciting and we're only right

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:07,079
now we're still seeing relatively single

00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,930
purpose devices i don't think we've even

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:13,079
begun to explore what it means when you

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,779
can put a bunch of different snaps on on

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,220
the drone or the robot you probably all

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,069
saw the announcement the DG I

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,089
announcements from earlier this week and

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,279
there are a number of other companies

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:27,029
who are building robots and drones and

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,339
flying things Earl copter was a as a

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:32,910
project that we've highlighted over the

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:38,459
last couple months that's super cool and

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:40,589
have been to a anub inchicore powered

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:46,199
well they have a flying drone version

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:50,339
and a crawling spider version that that

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:52,589
I think it just injects a sense of fun

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,779
into the things that are that people are

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,759
doing what they've into that's really

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,170
exciting it's fun every day I don't we

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,420
don't know about all of them in advance

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,040
because you know how it is people can

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,319
download them into and use it and so

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,899
sometimes I even find out about devices

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,160
people are making by watching my google

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,589
alerts or seeing what's in my inbox

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,449
every morning and and it's it's fun so

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,110
if anybody's if anybody's building

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,779
devices with

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,040
the bin to feel free to email and let us

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,470
know about them because we don't we

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,510
don't always know about the great things

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,589
that people are building with them or

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,930
post them on G+ or anything like that

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:35,310
and I think in the cycle and 1604 we're

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:38,370
also going to see just an exponential

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,279
amount of adoption and improvement in a

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,399
boon shakur in snap craft in the things

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,440
that people are doing with it one of the

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,970
one of the great things about have been

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
to one of the things that's always been

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,230
so exciting about canonical and I've

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,079
been to is what people do with the

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,890
products we build its we can we get

00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:01,680
super passionate about of into itself

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:04,230
but it's a it's another level when

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,279
people take it and build on top of it

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,290
and I think what we'll see in the in the

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,529
iot space building on top of him into

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:19,380
core is is just an incredible amount of

00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:24,300
innovation that that I'm really looking

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,350
forward to all right teaching by the

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,269
audience's well I think everyone's

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,699
really really excited about all of this

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:33,029
with can't just after this last quarter

00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:35,519
question that generated quite a lot more

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,430
of questions so let me just pick the

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,019
next one cheeseburger is asking when

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,940
will unity eight land for further

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:46,079
testing what do you think it will be

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,170
default um so I can't I don't know the

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,209
answer to the when will Atlanta broader

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,850
testing David you might actually be able

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:55,980
to answer that it will I know the teams

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,709
working hard on it impacts some of them

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,360
are are here in the office I'm in London

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,579
right now I'm in our London office and

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,670
some of the engineers are sprinting down

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:08,579
at the other end of the office when will

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,260
it be the default the answer there is

00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,350
when it's ready when you guys tell us

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,110
that it's ready we don't expect it to be

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,920
the default for 1604 what we want is we

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,140
want we want to know when everybody says

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,910
or and there's some amount of consensus

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,270
and opinion that this stuff is amazing

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,430
and it needs to be the default

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,860
and we're going to make sure that it's

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:35,140
that it's good and that we're ready for

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,520
it before we make it the default so the

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,580
if you want it to be the default you can

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,620
help test it and work on it and let us

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,190
know when when you think it's ready to

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,140
be the default all right so yeah nothing

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,740
had nothing to add to that to my to my

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:55,310
from my side only to say that we had a

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,410
great Q&A with the unity guys yesterday

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,060
so make sure to go to samhita to intuit

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,680
come and find that session it's the

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:06,890
unity 8 and convergence Q&A all right

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,200
thumb under hazen one of our community

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,880
corrupt developers developer of the

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,310
music app and now recently from the

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,800
weather app is asking how was the return

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,390
rate of the device has been are the

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,000
manufacturers generally happy with how

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,310
to release is half gone oh yeah the

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,590
returner it's been very very low less

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:30,530
than five percent and the majority of

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,720
that has been some some hardware issues

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,790
with the with the devices itself which

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,320
the manufacturers then replace that

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,030
replace that hardware so both BQ and may

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,490
sue the partners who have shipped thus

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:47,690
far are very happy both are planning

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:54,440
future devices there's been a great

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:56,360
reception there all right bananana is

00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,330
asking are the orange mad foxes

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,060
Raspberry Pi for sale and if not why not

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:07,580
oh so those are there for sale not not

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,780
from us those are simply those are just

00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:14,990
off the shelf boxes that we bought

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,459
there's nothing we can I forgotten the

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,339
name of the company that we bought them

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,320
from but I'm sure they'd be happy to

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,080
sell more of them they're completely off

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,810
the shelf you can they come in different

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,370
colors obviously we like like the orange

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,140
ones but I'd be happy to to pass on the

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,760
supplier that we bought them from and

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm sure they'd there have been two fans

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,010
and I'm sure they'd be glad to to help

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,230
provide more of them

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:46,850
all right Richmond is asking what did

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:50,149
you go to university I went to heaven

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,640
for college in the US it's a small

00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:55,039
liberal arts school outside of

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:59,480
Philadelphia I majored in math with the

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,549
computer science concentration I then

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,870
well then I worked for a couple years as

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,789
a software developer and then I went

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,640
back to university and did a master's

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:11,779
degree at Vanderbilt University in

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,610
Nashville Tennessee that was in the

00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:15,559
management of technology with an

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,220
artificial intelligence concentration

00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,230
and then I worked for a while longer and

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,210
because i like learning and like

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,120
academic environments i went back to

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,269
university a third time and did an mba

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:35,899
degree from Oxford University here in

00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:38,630
the UK this question is from Ryan Lee

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:40,880
types are there any partners the windows

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,169
in talks with that have a focus on North

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,929
America I'm guessing that that that is a

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:50,750
question related to phone and to end

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:55,070
devices and the answer is yes we are

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,990
talking to both phone manufacturers and

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,669
operators who have a focus on North

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,470
America and but don't have anything to

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,500
announce in that regard right now we'd

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,049
like to get a good us focused phone and

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:14,860
it remains something that we're working

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,860
on but but no announcements for now

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,149
alright next question is from

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,279
cheeseburger where do you see open

00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:25,070
source and 12 in the Internet of Things

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,940
market that is growing do you think this

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,740
will affect the appeal of open source in

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:38,330
more traditional markets like desktop

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:40,279
computing um I that's an interesting

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,450
question so let me take the first part

00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:47,149
of where do I see it I um we certainly

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:52,050
think that I've been to is a great

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:57,570
platform for people to build IOT devices

00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:00,570
with to be that that core operating

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,140
system platform of any smart connected

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,090
device and a boon to core or snappy for

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,720
short snap the snappy architecture in

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:12,750
DaVinci core has been designed

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,150
specifically for that world it comes out

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,390
of the work we did on the phone but some

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:21,030
of the the primary characteristics that

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,920
we've added into ubuntu for the phone in

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,750
terms of transactional updates and and

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,360
app isolation and some of the security

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,690
work are exactly what's needed in the

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,060
iot world it's exactly what's missing

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,860
when you hear the stories about smart

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,470
connected devices that are being hacked

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,670
or that don't have security updates and

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:48,060
can't be updated and i think i mean to

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:56,490
has a as a major role to play there as

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:58,530
that platform for devices and i think

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:04,290
that hope your question was about open

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:06,720
source in particular i believe and i

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,550
think there is a space for open source

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,060
obviously I've been to as our view of

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,830
the best instantiation of that of that

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,920
open source platform I think what's

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,260
needed there is a way to get the

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,610
benefits of openness get the benefits of

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,920
open source and be able to operate in a

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:30,210
constrained environment in some cases

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:36,360
there are IOT devices that need to

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:38,400
operate um with in a specific range of

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,710
frequencies for example the FCC is

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,430
concerned about what what devices are

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,490
attached at what level and if it's and I

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,530
think open source and Ubuntu in the

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,140
snappy architecture provide a mechanism

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:55,730
to provide the freedom and openness

00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:00,060
where it's necessary and lock down

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,120
specific elements where it's required it

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,490
would be a shame i think if we went to a

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,970
close source

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,710
praia terry solution just to provide

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:13,960
those protections in the very small

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:16,610
number of cases where they're necessary

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,520
you also asked I think if it will if I

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,600
think we'll drive additional desktop

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,870
computing usage that's a good question I

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,179
think I think it might I certainly would

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,070
like to see it I think what will happen

00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:35,120
there the way that would work would be

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:38,570
the app development it's the developers

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,250
who are developing the applications that

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:45,110
define the behavior of IOT devices that

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,270
to the extent that those those transfer

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,290
in that world of developers translates

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:53,690
over to the desk I'll say the desktop

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,850
market but as you know from our

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,650
convergence work I think that's even the

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,920
definition of what the desktop market is

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:03,470
is is changing these days I think

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,940
there's a lot of overlap in that in that

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:11,170
app developer world that will drive

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,400
cross-platform adoption and and

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,970
certainly would like open source to be

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,460
the to be the common theme there i saw a

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,770
presentation a while ago that looked at

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,600
the number of developers in different

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:27,530
communities and it compared the number

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,200
of developers in the traditional

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:34,640
embedded devices market and the number

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,030
of developers coming from the the web

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,910
and mobile world and it's those web and

00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:44,860
mobile developers who will who will

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:49,220
really drive and dominate the iot

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,980
development market just by sheer number

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,840
rather than the what has been the

00:23:51,980 --> 00:24:00,070
traditional embedded development

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,809
approach and so i think i think that

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:07,970
that there may be a wave there that open

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:10,940
source rides across IOT and into the

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,750
that converged world of personal

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,750
computing as well

00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:20,149
alright so next question comes from

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:23,749
which was actually one of the rubicon

00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:25,460
organizers from from berlin question if

00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,830
you have a chance if you had the chance

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,749
to go back in time and change something

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:34,700
in the one to which you can't do anymore

00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:53,169
what would it be oh dear what would it

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:57,499
be so if i could go way back i think i

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,460
think oh there though that's such a good

00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:00,769
question because the things that i think

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,009
of now I like I was going to say

00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,809
something about the some of the original

00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:08,419
design principles and though and the

00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:10,039
brown desktop I just somebody recently

00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:12,559
posted an article going back with

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,409
snapshots of screenshots of all the

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:19,539
desktops over the years and it made me

00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:22,249
very nostalgic for the brown but it also

00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:24,109
made me remember all the controversy

00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:26,330
over it it's amazing sometimes the very

00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:30,229
the very small things that generate

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:32,419
generate the most controversy I think I

00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:34,369
think on one hand I think oh we could

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,809
have just avoided a lot of a lot of

00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,239
arguments there but on the other hand it

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,479
helped it did help distinguish us and it

00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:44,389
helped make us different and it it it

00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:47,109
helped create a real a real bond with

00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:49,489
them into in those in those early years

00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:55,849
I think there's some things that we've

00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:57,109
done in the product that in hindsight we

00:25:55,849 --> 00:26:01,159
could have done differently or at a

00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:04,190
different time so for example when we

00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:08,239
introduced the dash into the desktop the

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:15,070
unity dash in particular the Amazon

00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:18,950
scope and the shopping scope which which

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:21,799
was so divisive at the time when you

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,270
look now at the Scopes on the phone

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,700
which consistently

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,320
are cited as being some of the most the

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,820
most pleasing behavior and most

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,490
enjoyable features of the phone that in

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,990
the right edge swipe are the are the

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,880
things that people are always comment on

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:46,420
the phone scopes are in our evolution

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,390
but of the original desktops go but it's

00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,590
the same was the same concept we were we

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,400
were exploring it was the same

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,380
experience we were trying to get to we

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,510
were perhaps premature and doing it on

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,550
the desktop we perhaps didn't pick the

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:04,990
best scopes we perhaps didn't have the

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:07,420
right the right user experience to make

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:13,060
it to make it really beneficial to

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:15,220
desktop users so in one hand I I think

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,510
it would be nice to go back and be able

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,820
to change that but on the other hand

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,600
it's it's led us to where we are right

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:27,180
now I would have been nice to get here

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,440
in a slightly less rocky path but but I

00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,820
think that it's been instrumental in

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,920
getting us here we certainly learn

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,800
lessons from experiences like that and

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,270
one of the one of the reasons going back

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,820
to the earlier question about when will

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,450
unity 8 be the default that's one of the

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:49,750
lessons that we've learned is we want to

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,890
make sure that that that our user base

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,720
is wants the feature that we're

00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,190
introducing and that the feature itself

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:05,470
is ready we don't want to push something

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:07,900
prematurely so our are not put in unity

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:11,170
8 as the default right away is a is a

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,060
direct lesson learned and respect for

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,230
the user base coming from those times

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:20,830
when we've pushed something perhaps

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:23,560
prematurely before there was before it

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:27,540
was ready and before the the user base

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,540
and the community was ready for it

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:39,280
I also would would um I also would

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:41,890
change some of some of the that the

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,270
branding and logo and t-shirt choices

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,830
that we've made over the years I have an

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,930
immense collection of AB into t-shirts

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,550
and when i get to the bottom of the pile

00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:52,740
sometimes i think why in the world did

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,740
we that we make what net looks like this

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,020
okay I have a right owned so some of you

00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,520
might have noticed that I'm being a bit

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,140
selective with the questions right now

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,100
if you're the ton of them and another

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,320
some of you have asked multiple

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,820
questions from just trying to see that

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,470
everyone has got a chance to ask their

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,240
questions um so Mara group is asking

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,220
what was the canonic what was

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,430
Canonical's response when microsoft

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:24,370
released continuum um so we watched it

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:28,480
with interest I think it's I think it's

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:31,780
a good thing I think it's validation of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,550
the evolution in the market that that we

00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:42,310
see I think it's I think it's a positive

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:46,150
thing when when others follow the the

00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:48,160
same path you've you've put out it also

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,650
makes me very anxious to get our our

00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,810
conversions capability out as quickly as

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,050
possible and for it to matures as

00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:59,140
quickly as possible it's clear that that

00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,910
there's a race competition is good it

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,690
should keep us all on our toes it should

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:06,700
make us all excited and reaffirm the the

00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,430
value and importance of what we're doing

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:14,470
and frankly the inevitability of what

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,910
we're doing and it should also serve us

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:20,890
a little bit a little bit of a wake-up

00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:22,120
call it's been very interesting over the

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,560
years I think when you when you

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,290
introduce something new when it

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:30,930
particularly when it changes people's

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:34,000
work patterns changes changes hard it

00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:37,120
you we get we're very much creatures of

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,090
habit we very much get get locked into

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,860
routines of how we how we interact with

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,200
something as personal as our

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:49,150
our computer again going going back to

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,530
some of the historical stuff changing

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:54,660
buttons from the right hand side to the

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:56,770
left hand side can be a major issue

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,440
something like convergence is going to

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:04,040
throw all of those habits all

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,810
air again and we're going to we're going

00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,460
to learn together what it means for

00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:09,230
people's work habits and what it means

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,080
for the environment that they want to

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,480
live in and the more work that others

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,510
like Microsoft are doing in that in that

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,600
area I think the I think it helps bring

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:24,530
bring all of us along as well we

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:28,880
shouldn't be complacent though all right

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:31,250
Pavel Stolarski is one of the GT API /

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,260
scopes developers is asking would you

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,210
say cloud is becoming more important

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,610
given how much market share will do has

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:41,720
in the cloud or do you see all markets

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:45,230
equally important a pinch is our vision

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,710
proven to assist is of a general

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,530
platform across the span of devices from

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,340
from cloud and server in the data center

00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:58,910
to the range of personal computing and

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,880
and desktop types environments to the

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:05,270
smart connected devices I think they're

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,510
all equally important I think there are

00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,400
different stages of their of their life

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,760
cycle and four canonical is a business

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,330
that they're at different stages so they

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,290
don't all behave equally we don't invest

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:24,500
equally in all of them but in terms of

00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:26,570
the importance to canonical and to the

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,820
importance of what we want a bindu to be

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,210
what we want it to be to the community

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:39,080
what we want it to enable in terms of

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:42,370
innovation for our customers there is if

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,370
they're all important

00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:51,479
alright next question comes from the

00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:53,939
nice what are the latest news about our

00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:58,889
OS the robot operating system in ubuntu

00:32:53,939 --> 00:33:04,229
Oh about raat are the letters are os roz

00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:08,369
roz sorry yeah um so it is a that

00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:10,279
community the ra's community uses have

00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:15,329
been to and I've been to core

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:19,079
extensively it the the components of

00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:21,899
Fras have been made into a snap to be

00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:25,109
able to use on snappy of into core and

00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:28,739
we continue to work very closely with

00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:32,219
that community to make sure that that

00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:34,589
snappy provides the the best experience

00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:37,619
for people developing developing with

00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:39,629
roz there's lots of exciting work going

00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:41,789
on there and we're really interested in

00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:44,849
working with people who are who are in

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:47,489
that that Roz community if you're if

00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:51,359
you're if you're part of that if you're

00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:55,819
building things with that software we

00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,819
would love to treat it to be involved

00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:02,489
communities asking could you elaborate

00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:08,429
on why you feel the 12 edge is not a

00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:10,349
good convergence and are you um so i

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,809
don't think i said i think i've been to

00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:16,129
edge is a good oh i mentioned a printer

00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:20,849
for android i think that may be what the

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:23,039
most probably yeah so um early on this

00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:25,049
was several years ago when we were were

00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,109
developing the convergence ideas and

00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:30,269
exploring what worked thinking about how

00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,740
people interact with technology now how

00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,669
they interact with technology in the

00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,230
future we built a prototype system

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:39,329
basically that was called a min ji for

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:43,230
android which is different than event to

00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:46,139
edge and that was a an ubuntu phone with

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,869
our sorry an android phone with ubuntu

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,759
installed that operated as an android

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:52,799
phone just normally like your normal

00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:54,509
phone and then we connected it to a

00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:58,109
monitor and display you got a

00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,910
traditional ubuntu desktop and there was

00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:02,190
some integration between the two

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,099
operating systems in terms of a shared

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,400
address book in terms of messaging and

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,989
phone calls and alerts on those things

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,549
coming into the event to desktop when

00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:14,670
you were and when you were in desktop

00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:17,130
mode I think that's that was the the

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,099
beginning that was the seed of our ideas

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,650
around convergence I think it was on the

00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,539
right path but it was awkward because it

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,829
was two operating systems because it was

00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:30,809
two different sets of apps you while you

00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:33,539
were running from a single device you

00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:36,210
still felt like you were living in two

00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,249
different worlds and I think a key

00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,450
concept of convergence is that you

00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:44,609
you're living in one world regardless of

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,739
the the size and shape of the piece of

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,710
glass that's attached to that computing

00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:53,039
world and so as we've moved forward and

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,739
as ubuntu has developed on phones as

00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,880
open to core and the snap and click

00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:02,789
models have developed as unity eight has

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:08,069
developed to give us a more consistent

00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:10,950
and flexible operating environment

00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:14,940
across devices I think I think we're in

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,890
a much smoother more elegant convergence

00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,450
world so that have been 2 for android

00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:22,920
system was was a good precursor but the

00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:27,720
fact that it's two different operating

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:30,450
systems was was very was very awkward

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,489
and I think having a common platform

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,079
underneath that's really the key there I

00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:35,430
think some of our competitors will

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,349
struggle with that same thing they may

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,180
have when they have two different

00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,369
operating systems underneath or even if

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,499
they make both of them it's still there

00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:46,259
still fundamentally fundamentally

00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:48,509
different beasts and you've just seen

00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:49,890
within the last couple weeks Google's

00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:52,890
announcement about trying to merge

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,170
chrome and Android I think that's one of

00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,299
the reasons why they're there trying to

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:01,650
get down to 11 operating system on

00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:04,289
devices rather than to up into edge was

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:09,960
the name of the crowdfunding campaign

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:11,890
with the super high power or phone and

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,819
that was going to

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:18,430
be a boon to ubuntu experience and have

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:22,240
been to converged experience so i think

00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:24,130
the the model that we laid out there is

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,750
exactly what we're building with

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:30,460
convergence and where we're following

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,230
the exact path that that we would have

00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,690
done with the event to edge what that

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:39,760
edge campaign would have done with what

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:41,829
we didn't do was make the make the

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,019
hardware itself make the handset itself

00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:49,180
and and make it as powerful and cool as

00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:51,339
as it would have been we continued even

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,079
without that campaign being successful

00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,769
we've continued on the software

00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,900
development path and you see that coming

00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:06,430
into fruition now particularly in the

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:10,299
cycle in and in the 1604 release next

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:12,760
question is from Jala you mentioned you

00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:15,549
mentioned expanding up scope and feature

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,559
offerings in the future can we expect

00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:19,539
performance to improve or should current

00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:21,250
users upgrade their hard work at their

00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:26,220
Hardware if they want better performance

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:30,009
I think we should expect performance to

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,130
improve we're also doing some work

00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:35,500
around some of the the navigation

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,630
between scopes and are in our user

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,920
testing we're finding that there's still

00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,839
some issues have around people discover

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,680
discover scopes and navigate around them

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,049
particularly in terms of some of the

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,990
component content pieces that are

00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:56,109
embedded into a scope and so we're doing

00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,170
some work that is still in the design

00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:04,630
phase as now but that is that is aimed

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:06,250
at addressing some of those those just

00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:11,410
smoothing off some of the rough edges

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:13,750
there and so there'll be there'll be

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:17,740
continual improvements there are 0 ta

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:20,890
schedule I believe as a new update once

00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:23,289
every six weeks or so and you should see

00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,590
at various times not just feature

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:28,060
improvements but also

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:31,360
performance and stability improvements

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,400
in the in those OTAs I think it's always

00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,140
fun to get new hardware and we'll have

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,980
we'll have some interesting hardware

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:41,730
coming out next year but you you'll be

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,650
able to benefit from the feature

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:47,770
enhancements and performance

00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:53,890
enhancements as they come out in the

00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:55,750
OTAs as well especially strong cheese

00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:59,260
berg do you see an opportunity in

00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,800
smartcards houses in sorry Sammy syrupy

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,420
do you see an opportunity in smart cards

00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,350
has there been any interest form any

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,820
partners smart cars so there are a

00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:15,190
number of car manufacturers who are

00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:19,810
already working with up into Tesla uses

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:26,740
up into there have been a couple smart

00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:31,000
card in the R&D phase that are that use

00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:35,440
up into and I think that's part of this

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,540
this vast world of innovation that that

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,080
happens by making a great a great

00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,090
platform we don't intend to go

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,960
specifically into the car business we're

00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:50,530
not going to build a version of a bin do

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,050
that specifically meant for cars but i

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,890
think the improvements that we're making

00:40:53,050 --> 00:41:00,340
in terms of update ability and security

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:02,920
around up into core make it a perfect

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,930
platform there and I I wouldn't be

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,050
surprised at all if there's more if

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:13,090
there's more automotive interest on the

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:16,990
snappy of ng core product as as the

00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:20,320
uptake there develops but you can see

00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,270
there's there's a number of videos

00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,760
online from various car manufacturers

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:28,120
where they've used of into both it is a

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:32,610
development environment and as a device

00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:35,210
control environment and in in in vehicle

00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:40,440
environments as well

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:44,700
but no no no no a bunch of cars coming

00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,099
from canonical anytime soon all right I

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:53,489
related one perhaps will we ever see

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:55,380
anyone to watch snappy watch um so would

00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:57,089
we ever see one again I think it's the I

00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,640
think it's another example of the kind

00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:03,499
of smart connected device that I that

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,640
will be built on a binge accor it I

00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:09,329
expect that at some point there will be

00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:13,950
there's there's just going to be this

00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:16,499
proliferation of devices that that come

00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:19,680
out whose whose behavior whose identity

00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:22,559
is defined by the software on top of

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:29,309
them much more so than the the physical

00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:32,279
form factor so while there's there's no

00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:34,589
no specific product announcement a

00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:36,269
product plan so don't interpret my yes

00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:38,670
but yes I think there will be a been two

00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:41,880
watches it at some point I think it's I

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:45,109
think it's part of this as I said

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,999
explosion of smart connected devices

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:52,469
that will be that will be running app

00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:56,819
engine all right referred another

00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:59,249
question from him whole this us we had a

00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:01,440
ten-year-old wondering what he needs to

00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:03,960
learn in order to one day work at

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,579
canonical do you have any advice for

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,119
young students who already have an

00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,289
interesting software and open source

00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:17,160
that's great I didn't know about the

00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:19,829
ten-year-old um I think I think my

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,509
advice is to is to follow your passion

00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,309
if you already have an interest there's

00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:27,289
so many opportunities where you can

00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:30,680
where you can express that I think you

00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:33,809
don't have to be limited to what you

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,140
learn in school or do in the classroom I

00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:41,160
think there's amazing things that can be

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:43,710
done at at any age if you want to work

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,450
at canonical someday I would say being a

00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,390
member of the open source community and

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:54,769
learning the ethos of the community

00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:57,750
is a is a great way to start learning

00:43:54,769 --> 00:44:00,569
there's so many life skills that people

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:02,750
can learn as part of the of the open

00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:08,130
source community you learn how to

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:11,970
communicate across all mediums not just

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:16,950
face-to-face but in video hangouts in

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:19,410
IRC in email in bug reports you learn to

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:24,059
communicate across such a wide range of

00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:26,190
people the diversity in in the open

00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,680
source community with the possible

00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:31,019
exception or gender diversity is pretty

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,180
is pretty vast I don't know many other

00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:36,089
things you can get involved with that

00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:40,829
that lets you work with people all all

00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:42,869
over the world and the technical skills

00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:46,829
that you would develop by working in the

00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:49,019
in the community are astounding you get

00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:53,250
to work with some of the best the best

00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:56,250
people in the world and that's there's

00:44:53,250 --> 00:45:01,200
just huge opportunity there it's one of

00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:03,450
the reasons why we often recruit and

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,190
find our not just our engineers but

00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:08,400
other people that work at canonical out

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:11,579
of the open source community they have

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,019
the range of not just programming skills

00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:17,789
but communication and life skills

00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:21,359
problem-solving in a respectful

00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:28,660
collaborative way that that's very

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:31,999
valuable for any employer alright

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,730
Riley's site is asking pressing for

00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:37,489
services left like landscape seem very

00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,380
much aimed at large enterprises have you

00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:41,420
considered a stripped-down cheaper

00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,819
version of the service for startups

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:48,589
small to medium-sized businesses and

00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:51,890
local and state governments um so that

00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:55,609
the we've recently revised the landscape

00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:57,380
pricing so that for small estates ever

00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:59,960
been to you can use it for free so I

00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,910
think it's up to 10 10 servers you can

00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,789
you can use it for free and when you

00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:09,160
start to to get above that the pricing

00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:11,680
kicks in I wouldn't expect us to have a

00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:15,529
differentiated pricing between

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,980
enterprise and small business per se but

00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:22,460
there is i believe pricing based on the

00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:24,589
the size of the the oven to estate that

00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,099
you're that you're managing and so

00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:32,589
naturally the the larger states tend to

00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:32,589
be from the from the larger companies

00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:41,630
and next question is from rich Wayne

00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:44,599
what is Canonical's position on doing a

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,369
tablet kickstarter campaign isomer

00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:53,200
Shuttleworth asset development is sorely

00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:55,970
needed in his secure noon yesterday um

00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:01,670
what is our position on doing a tablet

00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:05,509
kickstarter campaign I don't we prefer

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:07,579
so we have no plans to do one my gut

00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:11,289
reaction is that I think it's unlikely

00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:15,440
that we would do one I think there's I

00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:20,509
think we're more likely to to bring one

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:22,160
to market with with a partner but I'm

00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:24,499
interested in what people think if they

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,829
would like to like to see when they're

00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:30,499
the software's coming along tablets I'm

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:36,739
not sure a tablet Kickstarter campaign

00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:38,630
would be as interesting to people as as

00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:41,609
the ubuntu edge campaign was which

00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,200
really was a

00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:49,289
groundbreaking experience on

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:54,930
groundbreaking hardware so I think it's

00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:59,269
I think it's unlikely but um but open to

00:47:54,930 --> 00:48:02,220
it I guess as my is my gut reaction I

00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:05,730
suspect what I'm not sure what Mark was

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:09,710
referring to in his in his QA he may

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:12,119
have been talking about the need to for

00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:15,660
further enhancements in the software

00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:18,859
development experience I'll check with

00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:23,940
him and see what he was talking about

00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:27,569
next question is for from banana what

00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,599
happened with the Mesa one two phones so

00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:36,059
the meizu phones were launched in Europe

00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:39,289
they've sold out now um in a in a

00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:43,289
positive way we're talking to mizzou

00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:46,109
about what comes next there are new

00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:50,130
maisie products on the road map we're

00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:53,220
exploring whether we can restock any of

00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:56,339
the existing ones if there's if there's

00:48:53,220 --> 00:49:00,900
any stock left in their in their factory

00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:04,529
process so the what's happened with it

00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:08,519
is it was it was a success in Europe and

00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:10,559
we're working on the on the next product

00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,019
releases we continuum is it was very

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,630
happy with the results there will be

00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:21,109
future announcements with with us and

00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:21,109
mezu and so stay tuned

00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,000
right next question comes from sid baton

00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,280
with the discussion about background

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,630
processes in mind do you think that you

00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,390
need more developers for the phone

00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:38,160
project and I led myself some background

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:42,599
for some of you know not familiar with

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:45,150
the video discussion the background

00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:46,290
processes discussion was was a

00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,859
conversation on do you want to phone

00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:52,680
mailing list about the architecture of

00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:55,609
application or rather the life cycle in

00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,349
the way we do too so with that in mind

00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:00,270
do you think we need more developers for

00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:07,230
the brutal project on the phone project

00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:09,059
um I think we do we need more developers

00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:12,450
if it's an out if that's an offer of

00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:14,579
volunteering then yes absolutely we'll

00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:17,369
always will always use more developers

00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:21,119
look of somebody on our team recently

00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:22,710
said that he's never been met a software

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,359
development team that could solve all

00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,099
their problems with just another five or

00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:27,780
ten engineers that if they had another

00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:30,180
five or ten engineers everything would

00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,859
be perfect and I think almost every

00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:37,859
software development project feels like

00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:40,500
that nearly all of the time I'm very

00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:42,030
happy with the team that that we have

00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,630
right now working on a binge above the

00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:47,549
canonical team and the the community

00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:51,839
team I think there's I think there's

00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:55,680
good collaboration across canonical

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:59,150
community and even our partners who who

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:03,270
contribute and help make up into better

00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:05,430
we are not closing our doors to anyone

00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:08,369
else who wants to come and join and move

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,980
the platform forward and it is true that

00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:16,260
things may move faster if we had if we

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:19,470
had more developers but I but I think

00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:25,020
we've got we've got a great team now and

00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:29,730
where we're while we're doing some some

00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:32,010
hiring I don't think that that hiring a

00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:35,069
bunch more people to do solve a specific

00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,540
problem does much more than solve that

00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:37,740
specific problem and then there's the

00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,300
next problem that you alternate

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,980
another five or ten people were the next

00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:48,360
team that also needs another five to 10

00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:50,580
ppl a question from Michelle are beside

00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,060
convergence can we imagine some kind of

00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:56,670
equivalent of apples continuity

00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:58,080
specifically hand off that is instant

00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:03,240
communication between a phone and a

00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:05,640
computer yeah I think we're yes I maybe

00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,970
not that specifically but I think we're

00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,420
just at the beginning of understanding

00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:14,580
what convergence means and how what it

00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,880
enables in terms of people's work flows

00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:20,310
with their phones and computers and

00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,130
other connected devices that may be at

00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:25,260
home or that they may carry around it

00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:28,080
may be that you you actually carry

00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,090
around your personal computer on a as on

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,000
some kind of fob on your keychain and

00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:37,530
you've got a disconnected piece of glass

00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:43,020
that that things appear in different

00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:45,630
places so I think we'll see I not sure

00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,820
about that handoff I'm not familiar with

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:54,450
that hand off feature in particular but

00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:58,560
I think well will the will go way beyond

00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:00,750
just what we're seeing now of being able

00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,270
to power a larger display and have

00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:05,520
window management in a in a desktop

00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:09,260
environment and versus a phone

00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,730
environment when you're on a on a phone

00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:16,320
it's an exciting it's an exciting place

00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:20,280
to be and contribute to ok so we're

00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,290
nearing the end of the Q&A I think I'll

00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,630
pick two of the remaining questions and

00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:29,880
then we can wrap it up to half time for

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:32,100
joining the next ones um question red

00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,230
hat CEO recently wrote a book about

00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,240
living an open-source oriented company

00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:41,430
have you given any thoughts on writing a

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:46,910
book yes I have as a matter of fact in

00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:49,650
two different forms one I actually did a

00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,580
start to write a book at one at one

00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:55,620
point I'm a

00:53:50,580 --> 00:54:01,490
frustrated novelist I started to write a

00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:05,370
book this was before canonical around a

00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:09,780
cent in the in the defense contracting

00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:11,850
computer IT world and got about a third

00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,100
of the way I threw that I would say and

00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,720
then canonical came along and so I had

00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,980
to put that aside because working on a

00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,860
been to it canonical was way more

00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:23,970
exciting than then my book which was

00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:28,350
suffering from a real lack of plot and

00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:32,730
then the second one is a toy with the

00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:34,620
idea of a book about canonical I I think

00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,120
we're not we're still on this adventure

00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:43,130
but at some point the adventure will

00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:46,050
will reach a point where where there's a

00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:48,900
reasonable vantage point to look back

00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:50,910
and reflect on and I think that would be

00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,130
very interesting to do at some point I

00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:59,640
think Canonical's done very interesting

00:54:53,130 --> 00:55:01,800
things in terms of our vision Ferb into

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,860
our business model our relationship with

00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,740
partners and really importantly are our

00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:10,710
relationship with the community and how

00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:14,490
we've tried to explore that interaction

00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:17,430
between corporate and community

00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:23,730
interests and run a company that stays

00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:26,190
true to those open source ideals and the

00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,960
and the beliefs of openness and

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:33,090
transparency that we talked about at the

00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:34,590
at the very beginning it's certainly the

00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,300
case we acknowledge that we haven't

00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:40,100
always gotten it right but I think I

00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:43,560
think it's a very interesting trajectory

00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:47,790
and I think it it would be interesting

00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:49,140
for others to read and reflect on in

00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:53,610
terms of some of the things we've done

00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:57,390
as a company in that have been so

00:55:53,610 --> 00:56:00,470
heavily influenced by and inspired by

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,470
the open source community

00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:06,930
excellent they're looking forward to the

00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:11,640
new books coming up service well doesn't

00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:14,009
know soon enough friends I'm not all

00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,250
right so just to wrap up then I'll take

00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:18,599
one nice and easy one what release of

00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:22,349
food would you take when you when

00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,789
stranded on a desert island oh I would

00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:25,799
take without a doubt I would take the

00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:29,910
most recent one and I would take the

00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:36,170
artwork from Hardy the hardy heron which

00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:38,759
is still my all-time favorite artwork

00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:43,920
but the button but newer is always

00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:46,589

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,769
