00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,690

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,890
have been as been a topic also on the

community roundtables and we will be

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,739
looking at ways to increase the

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,290
visibility and the amount of donation to

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,290
support our wonderful community projects

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,040
another interesting discussion we just

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,739
happen the are before the the plenary

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,190
it's what meet up to come we will be

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,340
offering local teams the opportunity to

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,769
use me.com as a service to increase

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,420
visibility and participation at at their

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,980
events this will be an opt-in and

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,910
something that will combine with

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,760
existing local portal service and we are

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,670
going to start go in hand with a with a

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,400
pilot for any tips want to to test it

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,170
and verify tips that want to verify this

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,340
together with the with the local council

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,150
another interesting discussion has been

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,430
the feature plans for the o-line summit

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,380
we will perhaps stress planning sessions

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,810
lines and focus more on presentations

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,670
demos and and more trips and most

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,829
importantly will be putting together a

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,200
proposal for enhancements to make undo

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,500
it would work on elle.com more

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,139
accessible to tips and for them to be

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,849
easier to schedule a talk public

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:10,560
hangouts also in the upcoming days will

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,230
be doing the groundwork to participate

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,109
in the Google coding initiative I as an

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,039
organization the registration deadline

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,720
development tracked on Tuesday started

off with a great session from Christian

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,330

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,040
Ubuntu app with qml good place to get

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,870
started if you want to write apps for a

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,240
bunch of phone we then moved on to a

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,960
section about the music app where we

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,370
planned for the short term and what

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,980
we're going to do with the music app and

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,930
also the results of a recent Google part

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,790
of Google Plus polls we put out asking

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,060
people what they wanted us to work on

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:32,550
and the results were surprising in a

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,410
BuzzFeed style click through to find out

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,560
we didn't had a weather app planning

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,270
session where we discussed plans for

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,340
notification system to give you

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,350
notifications in the weather app when

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,060
you when there's adverse weather

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,169
conditions nearby or just to let you

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,910

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,919
you know butters taking on brewer or not

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,470

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,690
language weather reports and map and

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,070
radar displays I must apologize if you

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,810

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,070
Fawkes night here in the UK where we

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:06,370
celebrate people by burning them and

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:09,330
remember yes uh there was then a

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,100
developer documentation health check

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,229
where we looked at new strategies to

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,390
improve our documentation such as

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,130
improving the discoverability of the

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,500
existing content and the community made

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:25,390
resources and refining the user journeys

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,180
and adding video tutorials Wednesday

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,729
kicked off with a scopes roundtable

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,200
where there was a presentation of new

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,950
dynamic previews in scopes

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,790
and improving scope refreshing to make

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:43,520
it feel seamless so that you don't get

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,600
that refreshing redrawing the whole

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,940
screen scopes that's good looked a

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,630
little at the filter API and filter

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,160
widgets some more aggressive caching so

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,230
we're not having to go online to always

00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,490
get content and there was an

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,370
announcement there about of scopes

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,650
contest coming soon so find out more

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,440
about that from a sketch around table it

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,690
was a community core apps QA session

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,120
which covered the new core apps Jenkins

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,090
which is used for building and testing

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,190
the core apps whenever changes are made

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,990
and discuss the resources available to

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,700
app developers for testing their

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,720
applications and next we had a dekko

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,430
planning session deco is the email

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,470
client on the phone and a session about

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,600
that detail the current outstanding

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,670
tasks for landing deco as a default

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,800
email client on the phone and we

00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,160
discussed how we'll deliver a converged

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,470
version of deco to beta users and a

00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,880
stable mail client to more conservative

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:45,890
users by the mail app on the phone then

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,100
was a session about taking advantage of

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,980
online accounts presentation of the

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,350
simplified online accounts API there was

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,220
some feature requests in their support

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,500
for C++ account plugins and not just qml

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,940
was a bit of a discussion there and

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,530
there was a session about some new

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,440
feature we're landing which is the

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,090
in-app purchases API for a run to which

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,310
allows developers of phone apps to get

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,530
paid when users decide to purchase items

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,210
within their apps we're starting a pilot

00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,230
with a few developers before we open

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:21,280
this little wider developer audience and

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,810
next up on Thursday was an app design

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,120
roundtable James from the design team

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,680
gave a brief talk about some of what the

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,630
design team were doing for a couple of

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,460
the core apps mostly we took a little

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,050
bit of that decade and it was a kind of

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,750
precursor to a talk he was giving a

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,880
little later on then Kevin fader from

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,370
the community demonstrated his 12 UI

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,740
toolkit inkscape and printable tools

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,540
that was really really cool and if

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,610
you're interested in improving the look

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,250
and feel of your apps or designing new

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,980
apps

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,100
or creating a new icon for your app then

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,720
that's certainly worth viewing like the

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,130
second half of that of that video there

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,620
was also an introduction to scope

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,810
session today which explained what Scott

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,850
scopes are and how they work and a water

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:11,550
solution architecture and how you can

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:22,260
make your only likes gotten super fast

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:24,330
go or JavaScript you hear that this is

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,260
our like July that whatever it is for

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:31,470
you guys then there was a section on

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,000
writing html5 apps and which a recurring

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,740
session to introduce developers to the

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,620
set of web technologies available on

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,000
Ubuntu to develop applications there was

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,460
some there was an update their about the

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
web app container features on my web app

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,590
generator and alternative navigation UX

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,040
from ogron's and thoughts about react

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:54,770
Jas and react native and I think I'm

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,770
done from the app and scope track

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,430
excellent time for I work there yes

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,290
thank you alan and thank you for the the

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,500
fireworks and bottle rockets always

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,690
appreciate it the scopes team

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,540
appreciates a little shout out all the

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:16,110
way from from the UK all right next up

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,210
we have mr. Castro and he's going to be

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:22,260
talking about cloud server and and all

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,430
things fun new platoon hello i'm jorge

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,710
castro i'll be talking about two things

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,540
today with your cloud server which is

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,000
the OS and OpenStack of stuff and of

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,589
course the juju bits which is what you

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,860
use to deploy workloads on top of the

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,910
cloud so on to so I'm not on the with

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,290
your server and cloud team so I'm

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,490
speaking on behalf of John Grimm so

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,380
hopefully I won't butcher it too much

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,320
but on Tuesday they talked about apt

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,760
install OpenStack was a title for the

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,120
session but that's basically a terminal

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,740
base UI for installing OpenStack if you

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,690
haven't seen this before all this really

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,460
does is leverage the existing juju and

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,120
juju charms that we use to deploy

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,440
OpenStack and as of last week as part of

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,810
the OpenStack developer summit we

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,960
actually demoed doing

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,210
full openstack all in containers like on

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,070
your laptop with real XD containers all

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,100
nice and isolated beautiful it was

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,130
awesome so me for guys like us that

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,020
means no more devstack game we can just

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,370
play OpenStack and it kind of more how

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,560
you would do it in production so that's

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,810
really great they also demoed mass which

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,250
is up to a new version of one dot 19 for

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,650
those of you that don't know what masses

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,839
that's metal as a service I like to say

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,000
it's like adding an API to a rack of

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
servers and then you can do stuff get

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,050
machines and do that obviously that's a

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,670
simplistic explanation so you should

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,650
definitely check out those videos a new

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,680
UI stuff that they're doing on math 1.9

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,420
is really really sweet so I challenge

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,920
you to go check it out especially the

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,960
new networking stuff you can create

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,060
VLANs subnets you can do all sorts of

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,070
stuff right in the UI and of course mass

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,570
as an API command-line tool so you could

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,430
drive mass can also subscribe dude you

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,020
with whatever way you want or you could

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,820
use to go in CLI tools that we give you

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,890
that's that's all pretty awesome um so

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,210
the my sequel talk unfortunate i was

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,330
unable to attend that one because it was

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,950
a conflicting session but the TLDR there

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,570
is we're talking with all of the people

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,170
who make my sequel variants including

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,150
oracle percona maria DB on how best to

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,490
give people the my sequel variant that

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,790
they want the big takeaway from that is

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,980
robin basic will be pushing out his call

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,700
for ideas on the mood to server mailing

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,260
list so if you really care about my my

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,150
sequel and its variants definitely pay

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,330
attention for that list we're asking for

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,370
feedback especially as this the cycles

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,670
in LTS for us so it's that's an

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,320
important one for us and then Stefan

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,959
obviously showed Lexus d which is

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,459
containers for boot your server really

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,070
not much to say it's awesome it's

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,540
incredible if you're using VMs right now

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,089
there's a lot of use cases where you can

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,830
just one to one swap out KBM for Lex d

00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,459
and get a huge performance benefit and

00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,140
of course for us this is all about

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:04,020
getting as many containers density on

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,150
one machine as possible right so

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,080
obviously for people who run open stacks

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,600
and things like that does a very

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,610
important feature the canonical has been

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
sponsoring work on upstream and we're

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,430
really proud of it it's going to be

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,520
really tight clean

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,790
um it's just awesome I don't really have

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,350
enough nice things to say about Lex d so

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,360
that kind of covers a traditional abou

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,820
two server and cloud lots of good stuff

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,560
happening there of course the usual

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,240
suspects you'll get in every mood to

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,230
release the latest you get the latest

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,330
OpenStack all easily installable and an

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,370
ice road map of support for porting all

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,980
the new openstax to the older LTS

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,360
releases as well no changes they're just

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,230
typical good stuff you've come to expect

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,670
from us on the juji front we did nothing

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,970
about workshops because there's not much

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,350
planning for us to do you know to really

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,790
explain so we just did basically did a

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,470
bunch of workshops where we showed off a

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,880
bunch of stuff so we showed off big data

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,670
solutions that we'd like to see people

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,800
banging on for production the Cooper

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,010
Nettie's cluster work is really coming

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,420
in on likely we expect that to be

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,940
production ready as far as a deployment

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,399
those for 1604 which I guess is a cool

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,810
announcement obviously Cooper Nettie's

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,510
just had at one point oh the other day

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,220
it's up to you to decide whether Cooper

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,990
Nattie's is production ready for you but

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,670
the deployment method and the charms and

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,040
everything will be solid ready to go

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,930
it's reusing upstream stalker work and

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,800
everything it's it's really tight really

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,730
nice so I challenge people to try that

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,910
something that people might not be aware

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,070
of that I'm going to use this Avenue to

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,350
announce is if you're at a juju charm as

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,300
long as you open source it we will pay

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,790
for your cloud credentials so you can go

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,589
to developer dude your debt solutions

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,720
click that you're interested tell us

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,730
what charm what piece of software you

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,740
want to bring to the cloud will mainly

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,690
amazon credentials and then you can go

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,730
and create instances and do a bunch of

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,860
development stuff on us I pay the bill

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,740
not me personally but it's pretty

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,300
awesome dude you also got a new website

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,829
that would life today and this just juju

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,420
charms com you should check it out it's

00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:08,250
pretty great and the last bit is as part

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,130
of us attending faust m + config

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,290
management camp will be running a juju

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,690
charmer summit so a bunch of us will go

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,810
for the weekend to Brussels then we're

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,370
moving to get do config management camp

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,980
and the GG charmer summit which will

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,750
actually be co-located with config

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,880
management camp this is

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,170
the place to go for community config

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,280
management tools so we'll have guys

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,540
there from puppet ansible chef salt and

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,860
we'll be running our summit there as

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,380
well it's going to be a really good time

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,180
if you're really looking for getting to

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,100
the bleeding edge of what it takes to do

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,920
automation on clouds this is the place

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,260
to be so you can check out that our

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,600
website as a summit dot juju dot

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,480
solutions and config management camp is

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,070
really horrible to say because it's felt

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,720
a certain way so I'll just add that in

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,890
the show notes so if no one has any

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,570
questions for me and that's a glutton

00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:06,600
cloud server and you g-forces you know

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:09,150
for sorry I'm title first well done

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,630
George I I was just mentioning our CD

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,490
the lxd is really cool and they have a

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,470
super sweet blog demo on the sides of

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,480
guillen's containers org you'll see

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,930
there's an lxd demo hit a little button

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,819
Yeah right it's really really slick one

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,949
thing I should mention sorry is you

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,900
don't have to move to 1604 to trial XD

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,800
there is a stable PPA I've got it on my

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:34,470
machines um containers for a lot of use

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,230
cases is almost a no-brainer so if

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,120
you're using this kind of stuff lexi is

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,980
just a way to go it's nice the

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,180
command-line interface is nice and clean

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,790
and those guys do a really good job

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,770
documenting and helping people out so if

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,960
you're using VMs at work or anything

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,850
like that with this LTS coming cycle

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,680
coming up you should really put Lex d on

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:58,140
the list of technologies that you want

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:59,850
to check out so all right next up we

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,440
have the the infamous michael hall is

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,420
going to be talking about all things

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,540
convergence so this is a this is one of

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,700
the most exciting tracks for end users

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,160
as convergence has been a story that's

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,740
been sort of a long time coming and

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,020
we're you know edging closer and closer

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,790
and closer to seeing some of these

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,440
realities so I'm sure Mike's going to

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,760
share some some of the cool stuff and

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,280
some of the sessions that you want to go

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,440
back and check out right so this session

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
is combined both the the traditional

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,060
desktop track and the phone track into

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,150
one and also the additional focus of how

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:36,420
the two overlap so we started out the

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,730
day on Tuesday with the 1604 desktop Q a

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,770
plan where they discussed

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,080
some ways to enhance the image testing

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,350
and reduce the amount of manual testing

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,880
that they're doing part of that was

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,760
targeting ubiquity for tests which is

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,620
the desktop installer doing some

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,559
additional gating on images based on the

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,630
results of the tests and also doing some

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:02,520
adding some test cases to the live

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:05,730
sessions after that we had been to zinio

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,590
planning so that's Kubuntu 1604 this was

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,059
a really great session anybody who's

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,980
interested in combined to should go back

00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,530
and watch that it ended up running like

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,179
45 minutes past the end of the allotted

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,309
time so it's a good thing that was at

00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,200
the end of the day but they discussed

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,700
the resources for their CI

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,370
infrastructure which they've been

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,160
working heavily on both in kubuntu and

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,640
in upstream Debian so they've got some

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,950
plans on moving that to some different

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,660
hosts to keep it running a lot of

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,660
discussion on moving their documentation

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,240
back under the kubuntu org website some

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,010
of it had been moved into katie's wiki

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,679
they want to bring all that back under

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,820
the the one banner and get it unified

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,290
and also improving the amount of

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,929
documentation that they have for new

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,840
contributors who want to get started

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:53,850
contributing to come unto they are going

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,740
to be working on a new ISO image that's

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,929
going to contain more localization and

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,880
translation packages so you can get

00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:02,640
qaboun to in your own book native

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,740
language wherever you're at so that's

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
really cool there some concerns about

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,549
size and additional testing requirements

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,620
on that but that's moving forward

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,760
they're looking at integrating Kitty

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,049
plasma 55 and to come on 24 1604 and

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,940
planning on doing a lot more on air

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,500
planning and presentations to help get

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,240
the word out about the things that

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,820
they're doing and get people excited get

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,309
people involved and then finally they

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,780
going to work on boosting the community

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,910
bug triaging that they're doing they've

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,290
got a lot of bugs that are in a new

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,210
state and just need somebody to look

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,650
over and triage them so that's a good

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,020
way to get involved also you don't have

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:40,860
to be a developer or overly technical to

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,980
do that so that was tuesday on wednesday

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,230
we had a session on cute for 1604 cutes

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,960
now used by both unity 8 desktop as well

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,140
as KDE plasma desktop so it's an

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,170
important topic for us to get right and

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,940
those two groups in sync so they are

00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,000
currently planning on they're currently

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,670
working on cute 55 there's a PPA that's

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,220
got 525 dot one in it for unity eight

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,710
and Katie testers to start trying but

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,570
they're also eyeing cute five dot six

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,610
which is supposed to be released in

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,610
december i believe and that's going to

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,990
be the first LTS release of cute so it

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:21,270
will hopefully line up nicely to go into

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,920
1604 they're keeping an eye on that it's

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,310
going to end up when it becomes stable

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,620
on when it gets released there's also

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,260
going to be some work to try and keep

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,570
cute updated in debian also so that

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,010
debian and ubuntu inka been to all have

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,670
the same version of cute or at least

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,040
very close to it later on we had a

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,900
desktop planning the developer desktop

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,500
planning so that's the traditional deb

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,360
package based unity 7 desktop some of

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,920
the big news from that was that software

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,870
center is going to be replaced with

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,640
gnome software and some additional

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,210
plugins to that to make it work with our

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,770
a bun to App Store back end in addition

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,560
to that they're also looking to support

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,710
snappy apps on the unity 7 desktop so

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,660
this is a big ask for them there's a lot

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,010
of work involved than that but they're

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,720
moving full steam ahead and that would

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,580
really open the gates to a lot of new

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,970
really cool and interesting things

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,950
coming to our traditional desktop on top

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,260
of that there's a lot of triaging and

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,960
bug fixing going on in unity 7 and

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,790
compiz and adducts to continue

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,620
stabilizing that platform which is

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,140
already you know got into a really good

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,530
level there's going to be dropping some

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,730
more gtk patches wherever possible

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:36,060
there's some designs right now working

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,550
on how to integrate the gnome app menus

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,380
and header bar into unity 7 to make it

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,030
look nice without us having to carry a

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,680
bunch of patches in gtk on that so

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,290
that'll free up a lot of their resources

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,870
if we can do that they've decided to

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,390
drop bracero which is the CD burning

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,060
software as well as empathy the IM

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,730
client from the default install but they

00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:00,090
are also adding in the new genome

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,000
calendar app to the default install so

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,130
all of those have just been decided the

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,090
changes haven't taken effect yet but i

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,120
think they will in the next

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,610
you're so in 1604 s daily images and

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,799
then they've continued work on dropping

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,169
Python 2 from the default install in

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,340
favor of just Python 3 getting rid of

00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,120
the software center is going to really

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:25,110
make that a lot easier to do alright so

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,760
that was for the traditional desktop we

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,919
also had a session on running

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,890
traditional desktop apps inside the new

00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,320
ubuntu personal which is unity a Dan

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,029
mere base so Stephen web give a

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,860
presentation on some really interesting

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,620
technology he's working on to make that

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:45,120
happen called libertine it's going to be

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:48,539
a way to container eyes x11 Deb packaged

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,700
apps inside of a mere snappy environment

00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,380
so there's some really cool stuff there

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,720
are a lot of technical hurdles to

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,970
overcome a lot of work there but it does

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,890
offer a lot of promise on being able to

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:01,340
continue using all of the same apps

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,750
you're used to using even if they don't

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,520
use something that will run natively on

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,990
mirror and can be turned into a snap

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,409
package and then we finished wednesday

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:17,549
with a session on developing unity eight

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:19,770
albert tsg something on IRC give a nice

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,320
session going over all of the unity a

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,690
code where it lives how to get it how to

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,669
build it what all the different parts do

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,919
so that people who want to get involved

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,590
can start learning the code hacking on

00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,950
it and contributing some stuff back to

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,510
unity we've already had one guy on

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,820
Google+ who's tweaking the windows

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,159
switcher and post some videos and some

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,659
screenshots of that looks really neat so

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,029
if you have any interest at all in doing

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:47,520
unity eight development to ml's really

00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:49,590
really easy to get started with go back

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,789
and watch that at session and he'll

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,159
explain to you how to do that today we

00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:58,770
kicked off with a convergence Q&A with

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,659
the Kevin gun and Pat McGowan we had a

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,159
lot of really good questions in there I

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,929
couldn't really summarize all the

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,360
questions so just go back and watch the

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,370
video it's definitely worth it some of

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,020
the highlights though were there was a

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,270
lot of questions about convergent's

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,570
support and the existing bqm izu phones

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,429
they don't have the physical capability

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,950
to do hdmi out so you're not going to be

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,679
able to plug it into a slim porter MHL

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,210
after and connected to your monitor but

00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,570
they are looking at different wireless

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,809
display technologies that we can use so

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,340
that you can still get a converged

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,419
experience out of those devices even the

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,590
ones that don't have the hardware

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,970
capability to do it through a port there

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,190
was discussion about how we're going to

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,110
change the life cycle for desktops as

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,169
opposed to phones and some of the

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,779
benefits and trade-offs that we have to

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,980
make on that there is some talk about a

00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,659
bunt 0 for android a lot of people

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,149
wanted to know what happened to it so

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,889
they both answered some of the history

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,230
of ubuntu for android and how that got

00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:01,529
us to where we are now with fully

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,860
converged a bun to experience all on the

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,970
same platform and then finally they

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,600
talked a little bit about our new

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:12,000
syncing framework called buteo which is

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,610
already being used for contacts and I

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,899
think calendar sync on the daily the

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,299
images of the phones i don't know if

00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:20,190
it's on the latest OTA but that'll also

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,139
open up some opportunities for some

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,049
additional syncing to happen in the

00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:29,179
future mike it does contacts but no

00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:29,179
calendar yet catalogs for the future

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:35,179
after that we had a session on app

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,380
convergence where we had florian and

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,669
olivier talking about some of the apps

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,260
that we've already been adding

00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:42,750
convergence features too so they

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,019
highlighted the web browser app as well

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,370
as the contacts app Olivia gave a really

00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,019
nice presentation of all the different

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,659
convergence features that are already

00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,850
working in the web browser app showing

00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,649
it off in desktop views and then

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,769
shrinking it down to a smaller size and

00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:02,779
showing you what changes to make it work

00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:04,830
better in that form factor in size and

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:06,539
Florian did the same with the contacts

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,340
app and then also went and demonstrated

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:10,559
a lot of the work going into the SDA K

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,600
components to make them work better in

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,120
the desktop environment there's some new

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,130
components that were specifically

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,570
designed to enable this and also a lot

00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,980
of improvements to existing components

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,260
to make them work better with a mouse

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,700
and a keyboard so go back and if you're

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,380
an app developer this is a good session

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,289
to watch to see what's available there

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,090
and then interestingly they also gave us

00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,399
a hint that we might be getting flash

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,789
support in the a bun to web browser

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,359
they're looking

00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:39,850
I think working already on integrating

00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,830
pepper flash from chrome into our

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,460
browser so that's really cool an

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,019
interesting thing I hadn't heard of yet

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,359
after that we had James from the design

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:51,669
team on we mentioned this earlier he was

00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,859
giving a more general discussion about

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:56,590
design concerns and what to think about

00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:58,659
as an app developer to make your appt

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,059
converge between different the form

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:04,029
factors one of the big takeaways from

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:07,419
that is don't think about phone and

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,830
tablet and desktop think about staged in

00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,269
windowed mode because you're going to

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,220
have a lot of devices in the near future

00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:15,849
that it's really going to be hard to

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,109
define you know as just the phone or

00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:19,840
just a tablet there's going to be a lot

00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:21,759
of crossover so think more about is it

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,070
going to be staged wherever you think

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,389
it's one app window at a time or is it

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,210
going to be windowed like on a desktop

00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:29,470
um think about things like what kind of

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,359
input you're going to have is it going

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,359
to be touch is it going to be a mouse

00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,889
pointer you're going to have a keyboard

00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,220
you'll be able to adapt your app based

00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:40,539
on those to make it work really well

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:46,450
regardless of the kind of device that

00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:48,159
the user has um he also mentioned that

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,489
they're getting ready for a really big

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,599
overhaul of the SDK like like I said

00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,799
before and showed off some of the

00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,619
changes that are already there a lot

00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,019
more changes coming in to make the SDK a

00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:00,070
really powerful desktop UI toolkit in

00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:03,220
addition to being a really powerful

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,979
phone and tablet UI toolkit and then

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,869
just before this we had one of the KDE

00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:09,669
plasma developers on who is giving a

00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:14,109
summary of the work that's gone into

00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:16,739
plasma Mobile which is the KDE GUI

00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:18,639
environment for mobile phones I

00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:21,190
unfortunately wasn't in that so I don't

00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,269
really know too much about what uh what

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,019
he showed off but if you're interested

00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,970
in plasma mobile or converged

00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,649
environments other than unity that's

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,619
definitely worth going and checking out

00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:35,460
and that is the end of the convergence

00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:35,460
track summary

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:42,250
thanks Mike next up we have Steve who's

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,830
going to be talking about core and that

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,570
includes all things snappy as well so

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,940
I'm sure has some interesting things to

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:54,909
talk about in those worlds that's right

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,049
so yeah on the court wreck it should

00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:58,240
come as no surprise anybody who's

00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,710
followed the trajectory of Google into

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,450
development over the past year there's

00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,640
been a lot of discussions about snappy

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,149
this week on this on this core track on

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,669
Tuesday we had sessions first to talk

00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,899
about snappy frameworks creating more of

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,760
them there were good discussions about

00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:15,010
the general definition and understanding

00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,360
of what a framework is what what can be

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,450
a framework what should be an app and

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,159
what other options there are and that

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,620
session saw some good input from many of

00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,000
the customers are snappy things are

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,590
looking good for snap you in two core

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,320
being the basis of event whose future

00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,360
and among frameworks we should see

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,460
landing soon is a Bluetooth and a

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,279
connectivity framework based on network

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,960
manager also on Tuesday there was a

00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,000
session about snap packages for phone

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,070
and desktop apps Kyle pissouri and

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,539
Alejandro Cora presented their analysis

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,789
on what it would take to convert the

00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:47,919
phone from clicks to snaps a detailed

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:52,240
discussion of a plan ensued and will be

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:55,330
ongoing up for the next weeks and and

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,820
then Wednesday yesterday we had some non

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,100
snappy sessions occupying the bulk of

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,769
the schedule non I'm sorry that the

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,529
nodejs and live v8 460 no for discussion

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:08,139
and we are seeing lots more software now

00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:11,169
build depending on the JavaScript

00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:13,630
ecosystem mostly as part of as build

00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,380
dependencies for documentation so

00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,630
there's a trend of increasing

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,010
dependencies on these and but we don't

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,990
really have a good long-term security

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,620
support statement on them so we had some

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,510
discussions there about how to allow

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,370
that as a build dependency in Maine

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,399
whether that would be security supported

00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:34,049
or not the consensus is that we are

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,880
going to look at the archive reorg and

00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:40,210
question and proposal from a few years

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,559
ago about changing the definitions and

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,639
allowing those to be used as build

00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,090
dependencies without committing

00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,620
ourselves to long-term security support

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,230
the next session of the day was a Python

00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,130
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:55,370
on the images session this we discussed

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:58,040
and assigned work items on 24 the

00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,370
desktop server and cloud images it's

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,020
this dovetails with the comments about

00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:06,530
possible changes this cycle to software

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,299
center and but we have we're very close

00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,610
to removing Python 2 from both the

00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,770
server and cloud images and there were

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,530
in fact some last minute regressions in

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,950
the seeds that caused us to miss that

00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:20,630
milestone for 15 10 and that will make

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,090
sure we get there for 1604 and we also

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,190
have a good road map for the removal of

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,640
Python 2 from the desktop we've even

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,830
seen some progress towards that just

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,160
this week in the aftermath of that

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,160
session

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,670
off the official images and there was

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,710
also brief discussion about what will

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,270
happen they use herb in Python and the

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,060
answer that is nothing will happen to

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,310
use with in Python and how scripts that

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,800
need to run on either Python 2 or Python

00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,380
3 systems would work from from precise

00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,340
through tues email we did not reach a

00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,990
conclusion there but it was a good

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,670
discussion if you're interested in that

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,140
topic you are encouraged to go back and

00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,750
and watch that video and look at the

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,450
notes last session of the day yesterday

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,350
was about Fe capsule and fall back epi

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,510
capsule support is a new standard for

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,770
providing firmware updates and it

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,930
doesn't require booting into a

00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,730
third-party OS in order to to apply for

00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,320
more updates to your systems and so

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,000
we've started to define the story for

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,010
how we will support that through you fi

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,410
in and today we're back on the snappy

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,630
again with several warrants and snappy

00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,370
sessions one was a session called your

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,530
feedback counts the snappy onboarding

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,240
experience there was lots of great

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,490
feedback from all kinds of developer

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,070
audience of audiences of a bunch of core

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,670
and the feedback will be factored into

00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,410
our documentation and onboarding plans

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,900
next up was a snappy developer community

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,490
resources session we are already using a

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,990
number of social media and support

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,250
channels for snapping so it was time to

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,620
review them and bring some more

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,080
structure to them we also decided which

00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,150
presentation workshop materials we want

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,710
to provide enthusiasts with so that they

00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,220
can represent snappy at conferences

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:08,149
universities lug meetings and so on okay

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:12,230
and finally we had the porting popular

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:14,179
apps / software too snappy session which

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,190
saw putting together a nice list of apps

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,870
which are often used on raspberry PI's

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,879
and other devices and this should help

00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,980
us start a conversation on the mailing

00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,690
list about how we can collaborate to

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:27,230
bring the most interesting of these

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:30,370
applications to snappy as well and that

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,370
was it for the core track this week

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,700
awesome thank you Steve and finally we

00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,230
have our our final traffic cover which

00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,870
is the show-and-tell of track and of

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,500
course this is this is my favorite at

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:47,750
every you OS and but we have the

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,490
illustrious david kelly to talk us

00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:53,030
through what sort of cool and

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:57,500
interesting demos were shown and was

00:34:53,030 --> 00:35:00,470
presented as part she wanted her hi so

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,510
yeah this rental sickness track was

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,980
really exciting we had a lot of red

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:10,640
token demos on tuesday we started with

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:15,380
the snappy in testing efforts so if you

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:21,100
are interested testing and look at ulta

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:23,750
p oh snap peas deeply tested you can

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,450
have a look at the session and give try

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:31,990
run this test locally and on real hard

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:35,330
workers then we had a fantastic

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:39,740
convergence demo from michaels and he

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:41,900
hooked up an extra spot for TV it was

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,340
great to see convergence in action there

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:48,220
was a lot of question was very

00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:51,290
interesting then we had a snappy clinic

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:54,020
specifically around turning rose apps

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,120
into snappy apps so if you're into

00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,260
robotics this is a really great session

00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:04,520
to watch we got some good feedback from

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,860
rust users and will really continue the

00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,910
dialogue with them because it was an

00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:14,090
excellent session then we had the demo

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:18,050
of gypsum Jepsen is a juju plugin that

00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:20,440
allows network passions modeling that

00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:26,240
mean you can test oh you up and those

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:28,670
network failures and kind of things it

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,490
was very technical session so if you

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:39,350
want to that sort of things I look at it

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:42,950
on Wednesday we get the SDK Q&A so there

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:45,110
is a new SDK package coming yet as the

00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,660
difference with the current one is that

00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,420
the dependencies are bundled in the

00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:53,360
package that means that you'll be able

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:56,420
to target any framework wriggle wriggle

00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:00,200
SW which version you are running Sophia

00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:03,020
on 14 40s you will be able to target a

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:09,020
slight the latest frame walks on the

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:13,010
phone we also add a show off of the SDK

00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:17,180
one point three components there are a

00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:21,830
lot of changes as I think it was my crew

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:25,670
talked about it earlier so that's a lot

00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:30,710
of components that allow many input

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:34,160
devices touch and mouse and I look at it

00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:38,900
it's a real your strategy winter pie

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:43,250
flavor maker um so demo was about

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,620
creating raspberry pi 2 images for your

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,650
favorite abou two flavors using the

00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:52,490
bootstrap the images for this available

00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:55,100
on Google to my 2.org and there was also

00:37:52,490 --> 00:38:00,200
call for help so showing to that sort of

00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:02,650
things I've look at it then on Thursday

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:06,580
I route sitter from the community

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:10,820
demonstrated the continuous integration

00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:15,260
efforts around community and all the use

00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:19,670
launchpad produce building ppas after

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:22,220
that perform any text and ensure just

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:27,290
the coach of the package so it was very

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:30,500
nice talk if you're into quality then

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:33,080
still run quality we got a history of

00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,620
user testing on the phone and automatic

00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,960
testing on the phone and the creating

00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,370
shadows it tests the location telephony

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:47,810
debase and all the components user might

00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:50,720
just use daily the also has not a lot of

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,980
info on outright test and outrun them

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,210
and go to

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,560
of a collaborative platform for tests

00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,960
hours and there was my favorite session

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,480
probably it was the JavaScript scripts

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,960
hands-on still Alex Abreu and macos

00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,660
Tomlinson which are respectively from

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,670
the UK p I and web apps team I've

00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,000
presented the new JavaScript binding

00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,560
force cups with node.js integration so

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,290
you can take advantage of its vast

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,020
library and modules you basically just

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:25,109
install NPM package easy in your scalp

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:29,750
it's really cool they will also a

00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:35,430
session on my craft ryanne from my craft

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:38,119
you know my craft it's this I a unit was

00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,740
lot in the headlines recently as

00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,970
demonstrated it and talked about unity

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:47,550
eight integration the world also section

00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:49,850
around game development on the phone so

00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,440
Mike shall done demonstrated

00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:55,740
demonstrated oh you with he was writing

00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:59,250
games for me to using become today and

00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:02,760
also showed how to package the game is

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:09,440
playin bats plague Elvis is the firm

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:15,300
walk in qml for writing games and um

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:17,490
well into support is possible and you

00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:24,240
should really give it a try and that's

00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:27,330
it for the shelter session awesome and I

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,740

came just as David mentioned the

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,540
JavaScript escapes which I thought I

00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:41,940
thought was most appropriate as it's

00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,900
official we understand they love their

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,869
