alright we're live welcome everybody to

00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:13,690
our first-ever a bun to online summit

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,429
give everybody on IRC a couple minutes

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,740
to catch up because the video usually

00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:25,270
has a bit of a delay and then I'll start

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:27,820
the slides for those of you who are

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,970
watching on a buncha land Eircom we're

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,980
also on Summit abun to calm where this

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,260
presentation and all the others for the

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,270
event will be available in a very

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:43,780
similar fashion with the the embedded

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:47,970
video in the embedded chat all right I

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,970
think they should be able to see us now

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,190
so I'm joined today with by Rick Spencer

00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,160
and Robbie Williamson we're going to be

00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,219
giving us keynotes on client and cloud

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,890
side of things respectively but first I

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,989
wanted to go through and talk about the

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,729
bun to online summit and the tools that

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:12,549
we have around it so this is our first a

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,280
bun to online summit if you've been to

00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:17,799
UDS is in the past it should be pretty

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,659
familiar for you because the bun to

00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,090
online summit is actually the evolution

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,909
of UDS where we used to have the

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:29,159
in-person UDS and then we switch to the

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:32,439
online virtual UDS now we are going to

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,510
more an all-encompassing online summit

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,270
so we've taken things that would

00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,549
traditionally be in ubuntu open week

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,150
ubuntu user days a bunch of developer

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:47,530
week and we've merged them into what was

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,560
the virtual ubuntu developer summit so

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,290
we're still going to have a lot of

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,990
topics on planning the next release of

00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,720
ubuntu which is the utopic unicorn so

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,810
we'll still have discussions on core

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,210
desktop cloud and server and the mobile

00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,570
sdk and where we're going with those

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,849
over the the rest of this cycle but

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,440
we're also going to be introducing a lot

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,080
of sessions that are more consumer

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,730
focused so people who are using the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,870
stable release the trusty tahr 1404 so

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,640
we'll have a lot of sessions that are

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,400
geared more towards people who are using

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,910
it as a desktop people who are consuming

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,830
the SDK people who are using Ubuntu in

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,080
the cloud and our cloud tools to deploy

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,340
their own services and manage their own

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,770
data centers we've got some track

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,750
changes to make this possible first of

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,960
all we have in a bun to developer track

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,960
which is the condensation of many of the

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,270
UDS tracks so what used to be core and

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,610
desktop and cloud development planning

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,640
has now been rolled into this bunch of

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,010
development tracked we have the

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,650
application developer track again which

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,540
we brought in the last virtual UDS which

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,270
is going to be focused on people who are

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,430
consuming a bun to as a platform and the

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,560
bunt to SD k as the tools to develop

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,459
their own independent apps and deliver

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,040
those we also have a new cloud DevOps

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,320
track which is kind of the cloud side of

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,300
the application development track so

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,900
this is for people who are using our

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,670
cloud tools like juju and mass to deploy

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,280
their services and manage their data

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,220
centers they're not necessarily

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,910
developing the bun to server itself but

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,860
they are consumers of it we have once

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,100
again a community track which is open to

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,709
any of our community teams for planning

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,720
or presentations and then we have a new

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,390
users track which is focused solely on

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,450
end users of a bunt too and helping them

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:54,519
get the most out of whatever part of it

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,810
they happen to be using we've got some

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,030
more track leads this time around

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,070
instead of one or two track leads now

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,880
every track has three or four or five

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:07,200
track leads we have a mix in there of

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,760
canonical and community people so

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,709
whereas before it used to be limited to

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,470
just folks from canonical that we

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,390
selected and tasked with getting things

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,950
set up this time we're reaching out and

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,160
including more community people which

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,289
has been a great benefit to us as always

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,479
the track leads control the schedule so

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,160
if you are running a presentation or you

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,910
want to run a presentation and you need

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,100
help getting

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,590
on the schedule you should go find a

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,090
track lead and most of all the track

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,100
leads are there to help they're there to

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,410
help people who are running sessions as

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,760
well as people who are just

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,040
participating so if you have any

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,590
questions on how do you submit how to

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,010
participate in something go find a track

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,440
laid and ask them they're all listed on

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:53,910
summit de bun to calm there's a tracks

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,710
tab that will list everybody and

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,660
speaking of summative intercom this is

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,230
it this is the tool that we use to

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:06,070
manage UDS virtual UDS and now the

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,830
online summit the website will list all

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,930
of the different tracks that we have all

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,140
the different rooms I guess that earlier

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,120
to list the track leads and it'll also

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,540
show you the schedule itself so

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,940
everything that we're doing this cycle

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,660
will be in the schedule here it's broken

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,660
down by day you can click on a day and

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,610
see that day's schedule if you notice

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,920
the little star icons next to each one

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,810
that's where you can mark yourself as

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,720
wanting to attend that session or not

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,550
and if you do that you'll mark the ones

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,740
that you're interested in at the top of

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,660
the page there's a my schedule link that

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,190
will actually show you everything that

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,500
you've selected that you want to be in

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,720
and give you a nice personalized agenda

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,220
it will also give you an ical link if

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,870
you want to add that to your personal

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:58,419
calendar the sessions themselves will

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,820
each have a page sessions are one hour

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:04,330
long and there are five minute breaks

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,250
between each one each session page will

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,140
have several things embedded in it it'll

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,300
have the video most of you are probably

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,820
watching on a page similar to this right

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,700
now with the the video in the top left

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,290
corner there's an embedded IRC below it

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,020
that will point to the correct IRC

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,820
channel and to the right there's an

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,120
etherpad document which we use for

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:28,169
taking notes and listing down work items

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,480
as we go if that doesn't show up for you

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,640
you can go to Pattie bun to calm in a

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,300
separate window and login if you're not

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,550
logged in it doesn't display it may say

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,420
that you need to join the bun to hyphen

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,150
etherpad team on launch pad

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,950
if you're not already joined that go and

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,660
request to join it and somebody should

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,810
approve you right away and that will

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,420
give you access and most importantly

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,520
after a sessions over there all recorded

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,560
and available on YouTube so you can come

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,900
back to the same page anytime in the

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,850
future and replay the video from that

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,470
session if you are running a session as

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,110
several of you are there's some things

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,330
to keep in mind try to be ready five to

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,550
ten minutes ahead of time it takes a few

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,110
minutes to get your hangout started and

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,780
get all of the information added into

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,240
summit so it's good to be prepared a

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,980
little bit early you will need to update

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,500
summit with your hangout and YouTube

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,750
URLs when you create them there's a link

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,480
at the top says edit hang out details

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,710
which will let you add those in there

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,990
most importantly if you're running a

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,700
session keep an eye on the IRC Channel

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,980
there will be a lot of people who want

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,710
to participate but who either can't or

00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:43,040
don't want to be on the Hangout so watch

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,810
IRC for questions for feedback and try

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,400
to repeat that on the video as they come

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,220
up it helps people who are watching it

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,550
later follow along and encourage

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,320
participation from everybody UDS and the

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,570
bun to online summit are supposed to be

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,520
about open participation so try and

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,290
encourage people who are watching your

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,560
video and following along to give

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,970
feedback and ask questions and of course

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,150
if you need any help running your

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,160
session ask attract lead they've got the

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,460
power to do anything that needs to be

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,350
done in summit to help you if you're

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,300
participating in a session here's some

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,040
things for you to keep in mind first of

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,080
all obviously watch the video that's

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,840

there'll be some chatter among other

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,100
people who are watching some sessions

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,829
of the things that people presenting on

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,509
video hate the most is silence so any

00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,100
engagement that you give them any

00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,199
questions that you have they're gonna

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,920
love it so please feel free to join in

00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:23,029
as I said already asked questions any

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,040
question you have take notes especially

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,139
if it's a presentation it'll help people

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,870
who are coming by afterwards see kind of

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,300
the highlights of it if it's a planning

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,069
session then get work items this is

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,949
important for us to keep track of what's

00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:38,899
actually going to be done over the next

00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:41,449
cycle and those work items will get fed

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,670
back into the launchpad blueprints and

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:45,589
then we've got another page status tied

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,949
abun to calm that will list all of those

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:53,240
work items and give a burn down of our

00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:55,129
progress on those we have some key

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,610
sessions this week that you might be

00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,050
interested in later today at 1700 we

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,300
have mark shuttleworth giving us a

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,970
keynote so that's always popular you

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,579
should make sure you attend that on

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:10,160
Wednesday at 1400 Rick and Ollie are

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,910
going to be doing an open Q&A session

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,490
about the a bunch of desktop and our

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,430
plans for that so if you have any

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,199
questions about our commitment and plans

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,329
for the desktop you should definitely

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,160
join there and ask your questions to

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:28,610
them they will have the answers for you

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,649
and then on Thursday at the end of the

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,259
online summit will have a closing

00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,660
summary where each of the tracks will

00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,670
have somebody come up and you've kind of

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,290
a highlight of what was discussed that

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,000
week in what sessions you might want to

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,110
go back and watch if you weren't able to

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,850
attend them live and finally get the

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,130
most out of this the bunch of online

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,559
summit is here for you and for your

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,209
benefit so make sure that you

00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:57,259
participate make sure that you get

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:59,930
involved um it won't be a success for

00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,449
you unless you make it one so get in

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,449
there talk to people talk to the track

00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:07,509
leads ask questions and most of all have

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,509
fun

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,880
alright and that's the end of my slides

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,930
so I will hand it now on to Rick Spencer

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,649
who is our vp of engineering to talk

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:30,029
about the client thanks Michael that's

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:42,600
one of the VP eventually I'll give me a

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:46,459
sec here let me of my slides okay okay

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,050
thank everyone can see that okay so

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,350
thank you so much for having me I'm

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:56,279
really excited about this um the online

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,769
summit and I'm super pumped about what

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,800
is going on in a boon to right now and

00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:05,700
on the cloud side n on the client side

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,040
so I'm going to be talking about some of

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,740
what's going on this week and in this

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,680
release on the client and of course

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,720
there's this guy a lot of exciting

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,980
things happening with the aboon to phone

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,050
as you know we have a couple customers

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:26,220
who are going to ship up into

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,920
pre-installed on phones and we are

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,110
working furiously to get a boom tube

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,450
ready for them ready for those customers

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,540
ready for the users who are going to be

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,160
buying phones with the boon to on them

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,110
we've got some new designs that we're

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,079
implementing and we just still have like

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,779
a lot of features to finish a lot of

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,770
work to finish it's going to be an

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,990
exciting sprint to the end but if you're

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,970
using the phone now and I've been using

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,760
the phone for over a year now I started

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,620
to mayes ago so but 13 months I've been

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,350
using nothing but have been to phone you

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,980
may notice that whenever we make a

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,480
promotion there's very rarely

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,250
regressions in that promotion so it was

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,350
always the case that the phone has

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,589
gotten better with those promotions

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:16,790
rarely the case that we have a problem

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,910
and so how do we do that

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,130
well the what I affectionately call the

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,770
ubuntu touch code base a new code base

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:30,470
that we've been building specifically on

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:33,170
phones and tablets we have four aspects

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,860
of that product that we that work

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,560
together so the user experience the code

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,500
the tests and the continuous integration

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,590
system are all aspects of that have been

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,790
to touch project that work together to

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:53,000
make this product which is making rapid

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:57,170
forward progress and very rarely moves

00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,950
backwards so this is um been a really

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:05,810
exciting project to work on and really

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:07,610
fun to participate in because we like

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,350
our only writing code when we know the

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,410
user experience that we want to achieve

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:16,130
with that code and we only write code

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:19,690
when we can write tests that verify that

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,010
that code is correct and working

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,510
continuously running our integration

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,310
system so we always knows whether the

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:30,170
tests are passing which means whether

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:33,080
the code is still correct in the face of

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,300
changes anywhere in the stack so this

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,830
combination of these four aspects to

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,800
make this product has been making it

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,140
like super exciting to work on and as I

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,080
said we're in a in kind of a sprint now

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:49,070
we're shooting for our first release to

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,410
manufacture at the end of august so it's

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,910
june now we're looking to end of august

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,770
there's going to be some discussions

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,930
this week about how we're going to get

00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:01,100
to that first released manufactured date

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,740
and so i hope that you're here to help

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,540
us with that and participate in that i

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,690
hope that you're using a boon to on your

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:11,060
phones and your tablets this is a really

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,790
exciting time a really fun time to be

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,060
part of the project because of the phone

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,390
but i want to spend some time talking

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:23,090
about the desktop and the reason for

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,020
this is because during this week we're

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,880
going to be discussing a lot about

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,680
desktop convergence so what convergence

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,870
means is that

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,450
the same code that's running on the

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,140
phone is running on the tablet and is

00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:42,500
running on the desktop same code all

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,480
those places and that unlocks a lot of

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,490
interesting things so we've already

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,290
gotten a good start on it this is a

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,810
picture that somebody took of their

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:54,800
laptop yesterday running unity 8 and

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:58,310
mirror on a laptop touchscreen laptop so

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,450
a lot of things work so this is the

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:04,190
unity 8 mere preview image that we made

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,520
available a few weeks ago to start

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,279
working on unity 8 and mirror on the on

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,180
the desktops really focused on on

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:17,300
touchscreen laptops right now and so

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,339
what you'll see is on this preview image

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,959
in the 1410 time frame that we hope to

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,490
make a lot of progress towards that

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,350
convergence and there's a lot of

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,760
opportunity to contribute to give

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,680
feedback and to try it use it all

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,050
different ways of participating in it

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,510
but I just wanted to spend a few minutes

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,880
talking about some of the opportunities

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,160
and also the challenges that we're going

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:52,700
to face as we work on desktop

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:57,050
convergence for the next few weeks so so

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,779
um on the user experience side we have

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,000
like the unity 7 and then we have unity

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:05,360
8 that we're making for phone tablet and

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,140
desktop so unity 7 codebase only runs on

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,319
the desktop today is really in tune to

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,839
us for the desktop now when we designed

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,850
unity we took great pains to make sure

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,030
that the design would transfer the phone

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,620
in the tablet I think if you use a phone

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:27,110
use a tablet you can really see the

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:31,550
benefits of that um it's uh you know

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:34,280
that the boon to phoned feels very

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,380
familiar because of that effort but

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,760
still today unity 7 only runs on the

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,880
desktop so you really have to move that

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,500
unity 8 over and there's going to be a

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,820
lot of work and

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,560
all to make that work well so for

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,470
instance like the way the dash works in

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,160
unity 7 it's pretty pretty flat but

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,600
unity 8 has a much richer experience on

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,370
the dash and so we need to move that

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,270
over make that work well on the desktop

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:03,670
the unity 7 greeter is simple it's

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,490
beautiful unity eighth grader has those

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,650
that same those same characteristics but

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,950
also has that wonderful infographic and

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:15,310
those experiences at the beginning unity

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:18,130
7 has only non-interactive notifications

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:21,520
who notify OSD but because of some of

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,140
the requirements for a phone like being

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,600
able to answer a call and other things

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,160
we have added snap decisions to unity

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,700
eight so we need to think about how snap

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:34,800
decisions are going to work on in a

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,510
desktop environment unity 7 has a simple

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,180
alt tab list pretty traditional but

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,980
unity 8 has that beautiful spread of

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,320
open application so we need to figure

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,690
out how to bringing the efficiency of

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,070
the alt tab lists to the beauty of the

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:52,510
visual spread unity 7 no edge gestures

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,190
but unity eight if you have a

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,510
touchscreen you soon get used to using

00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,700
edge gestures and the power of them the

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,740
nudity 7 has very traditional window

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,330
management has no side stage but unity 8

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:09,640
has the side stage which if we need to

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,250
explore how to make the most advantage

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,160
of that how to take the most advantage

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,900
of that on a desktop environment so

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,970
there's some technical aspects that go

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,560
does user experience aspects that we

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,300
need to solve some of the problems here

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,950
face some of these challenges and also

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,380
build on some of the opportunities that

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:34,660
we've made so for instance unity 7 is

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,790
built in knox and knox is our custom GL

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,820
library for building desktops and it was

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,530
you know really a great thing to build

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,630
at the time and really serve them as

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:51,929
well but since then we've written unity

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:54,190
8 in qml and that gives us a lot more

00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:58,169
flexibility and speed and making changes

00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:01,080
so it's much easier now to make changes

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:05,580
in 88 so is really much more inviting

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,529
for contributions unity seven runs only

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,940
on comp is an xor it really requires

00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:14,429
that we're unity eight is um strictly

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,330
runs on mirror these days so this is a

00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:20,429
big gap that we have to fill unity seven

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,470
if you have any custom scope scopes are

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,259
written in Python in unity seven but

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,549
unity eight the written and go or C++ so

00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,499
that there's going to be supporting

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:31,700
involved if you if you have favorite

00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:34,799
scopes that haven't been ported yet

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,679
there's a big one on the traditional

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:43,769
desktop there's no application isolation

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:46,980
um this is very different in touch but

00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:51,419
app new applications that we write with

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:54,059
the sdk on the phone tablet and on the

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,940
unity 8 desktop running an isolated mode

00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:00,049
it's a very very secure way to run

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,549
applications but the old applications

00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,669
have no notion of this so we have to

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:08,460
figure out how to bridge the UH nice

00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,600
elated in the isolated world similar to

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,649
that is this notion of an application

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,869
lifecycle so we've introduced lifecycle

00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:18,179
policies which control how and when

00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,940
applications run so on traditional

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:24,239
desktop and application is pretty much

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,559
free to determine how it runs but you

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,509
really don't want that on a mobile

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,419
device because you want to be able to

00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:35,129
control what's consuming your resources

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:36,929
extend your battery life also there's

00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,690
other benefits of that application

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,710
lifecycle so it's a policy based system

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,289
we need to figure out what's the right

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,919
policy for the application lifecycle on

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:50,489
the desktop I'm finally there's this

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,769
notion of the filesystem and doing

00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:56,159
updates with apt whereas I'm going to

00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:58,139
touch for phone tablets we use a

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,539
read-only file system which lets us use

00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:03,179
system image updates we use click

00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,070
updates so there's a very different way

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,499
of laying out the filesystem and doing

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:11,779
updates and we have to figure out how to

00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:11,779
make these systems work together

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,140
finally you can see sort of these

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,790
differences in these bridges that we

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,610
need to build in how you install

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,370
software so traditional unity 7 base

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,480
desktop we have the software spanner

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:30,030
whereas in the unity 8 mere we have the

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,670
cliq store and the cliq store is built

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,650
as a scope as opposed to being a GD k

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,350
application and the so the software

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,330
center is installing debian packages on

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:45,420
your system or is the cliq store only

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:47,130
installs click packages so you may be

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,770
familiar with some of the challenges

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,140
that developers have had submitting like

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,320
building click packet building Debian

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,710
packages submitting it into the store

00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,420
whereas on the click store it's really

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,070
quite trivial and easy for developers to

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,750
submit applications if you look at the

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,120
list of applications you'll see how many

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,010
have already been created and then the

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,050
software center just lacks and features

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,320
that the software store had that the

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:16,020
cliq store has and will continue to have

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,730
but you can see there's sort of a some

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,410
bridges that we need to build between

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,610
the software center in the cliq store

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:27,230
world as we bring convergence to the

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,150
desktop so as I said we're going to make

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,210
next to the regular 1410 desktop we're

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,820
going to make this unity 8 preview image

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,460
and this will be a mere and unity eight

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,830
only so it'll be no x order comp is if

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,550
you install this and use this preview

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,710
image it will be no xorg no comp is but

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,660
it will feature very basic desktop

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,610
window management I'll have a side stage

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:56,970
but be very basic window management will

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,100
evolve the window management later um

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,840
hopefully we'll be able to make the

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,960
software center and application scope

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,820
coexist so you'll still have access to

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,960
your old applications I don't depend a

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:13,650
lot on how far we get on making a legacy

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,560
but none click non SDK applications work

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:19,230
on mirror but of course you'll always be

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,820
able to use apt-get on the preview image

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,650
so you will have access to any

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,020
application that you want just not clear

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,550
how many will be able to get to run well

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,070
don't have tools to figure out what is

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,190
the application lifecycle policy for the

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:36,540
desktop like do we allow runs the apps

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,930
to run in the background and if so like

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,310
how do we how do we control that a few

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,740
things that we're going to strive for

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:49,590
really like to see a mere GDK back-end

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:53,070
really like to see the cute applications

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,720
there's already a cute back and for me

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:59,280
relate to see the cute applications

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,500
working well on the this preview image

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,510
I've done a lot of work to make chromium

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,100
run like to see that running the

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:11,490
interesting thing that we might be able

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:13,680
to do is make 1404 LTS run in a virtual

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,990
machine like a vm like experience on

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,620
mirror and if we can do this in this way

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:22,050
you could use the 14 10 preview image

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,230
but if you have workflow or specific

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:28,170
applications which don't work on it from

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,590
time to time you could run that VM and

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,680
get your work done in those environments

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:38,520
so that's what we're striving for for

00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,040
the desktop convergence in this cycle

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,680
and I think will be a lot of interesting

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:51,690
discussions about it during the course

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:53,880
of the week so thank you alright thank

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,920
you Rick now we're going to go over to

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,950
Robbie for an update on the cloud and

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:04,440
server side of things cool welcome hello

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,190
um let me tell you right now I didn't

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,570
make any slides oh I was asked to do

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,400
this yesterday but at the same time I

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,570
actually mark would still all that good

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,180
stuff in his keynote tomorrow so what

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,770
I'd like to do is kind of I briefly go

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,150
over with the cloud there lots of track

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,170
is going to be covering and how that

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,790
kind of lines up with what we're doing

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:32,880
it but you serve on cloud as I hopefully

00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:37,230
many of you know I let over to live

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,850
thanks Michael well you know that the

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,650
three I guess components that we

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:44,930
drive to you know across the whole

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:50,160
server cloud is a juju the server itself

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:51,840
the OS and it then OpenStack and those

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,960
are a discount City components that make

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,350
up the overall cloud presents that we

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,830
have I you know covering first off you

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,720
know is a server itself there's few look

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,370
in the cloud DevOps track a lot of the

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,550
discussions around server it's going to

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,130
be both focused on LXE which is

00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,450
something that a bunch of Indian

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,470
economical itself has been driving

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:19,170
forward for two years now we are you

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,580
know you're happy to have dr. looking at

00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,510
that in terms of how to exploit that

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,620
more in OS but as well as Alex the

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,140
containers and how we can take advantage

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:31,790
of that even more juju and mass use it

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,810
already in terms of how we deploy

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:37,170
Bluetooth sure who are into it to

00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,700
various I guess so abbr substrate so

00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,950
either you know basically in a cloud or

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,540
bare metal but we are looking at how to

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,510
you know push the envelope in photo/alex

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,480
see in terms of a party ended up making

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,420
it even more reliable more secure and

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:55,380
something that we can we use in terms of

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:56,820
exploiting you know I google had some of

00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,650
them blew out a great quote about Alexei

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,960
in the sense of a lot of times we talk

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,240
about servers versus you know cloud

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,920
instances you know you you youtube your

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,200
server like a pit hey shut your cloud is

00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,990
like cattle and they say when it comes

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,880
to containers your treat those like ants

00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:14,970
and in terms of just you know the the

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,830
breadth of how many you can use and the

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,470
importance of just one so so it's not

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,450
much it's more about leveraging as many

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,890
as you can cuz you know I don't know if

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,230
you study dance I don't we study infant

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,840
much but I'm the strength of answer in

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,460
their numbers and say what Alex see so

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,860
you'll see a lot of discussion around

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,880
let's see how it relates to juju itself

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,670
and the server we also have you know the

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,540
standard topics around OpenStack you

00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,880
know how about how we're going to move

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,130
forward with charming we have the Juno

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,420
release coming up as mini if you may or

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,120
may not know OpenStack releases on a

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,470
six-month cadence just as we do and we

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,610
do a braid you know the server team is a

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,650
great outstanding job actually tracking

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,270
that upstream continuously integrating a

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,880
continuous keep testing it against the

00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,200
development stack so that would as soon

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,610
as the next release but when she comes

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,700
out you're guaranteed to get connects

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,710
relate to OpenStack so there's going to

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,030
be some discussions around that terms of

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,059
how to keep moving forward on that

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:14,049
making a tighter integration discussions

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:16,660
around SEF and and how to better

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:19,299
leverage that we can you know the distro

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,790
some may know or may not know that ink

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,230
tank was purchased by red hat but that

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,750
doesn't really change our stance or I'll

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,460
stuff you know we what we're happy for

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,120
that to happen that's great for sets

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,169
great marine tank gets more more power

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,090
behind them from a development

00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,890
standpoint so we're going to continue to

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,470
look at how we leverage stuff you know

00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:43,750
not just an overstock wasn't going to

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:45,100
serve itself and I guess beyond that for

00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,070
server there be some discussions

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,650
probably around expansions of simple

00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,330
streams which is a metadata service that

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,960
we use it to let you know where the

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:59,110
latest Butchie server is when i was jus

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,990
to be in a cloud or bare metal so a lot

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:06,190
of discussions around server again

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:08,020
primarily a focused on I mean using a

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,150
server at the host OS but also we will

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,730
probably go into you know the butchy

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,590
server in the cloud we're very popular

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,650
across all the major clouds and growing

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,150
very rapidly both different to project

00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,520
and canonical do a lot in terms of

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,230
making sure that our users have a great

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,640
experience in the cloud so there should

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,380
be a few sessions around that as well

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,890
but they're always looking for the scene

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,450
know how well we can eat will improve

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,710
the experience of youth for the user in

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:41,440
the cloud and then it comes do you our

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,910
service orchestration tool that will

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,559
cover both I guess there's three parts

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,260
of Jews you in the census the core part

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,530
of you know of how we expand the core

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:54,190
feature sets of juju itself then there

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:57,490
is the charms the ecosystem around juju

00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:01,240
where we're looking to grow back

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,830
community in terms of the charmers and

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,940
those who write these charms who

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,020
deploying these applications in

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,820
different

00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,520
areas being on the cloud or on bread

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,470
metal and then there's beyond the

00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,480
challenge of the GUI which is the

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,990
awesome interface that you use to deploy

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,820
these things and really manager their

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,410
deployment um obviously the command line

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,510
tool is very useful it's very scriptable

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,990
but but the power of juju I think really

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,580
shows itself well through the greeley oh

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,170
so there'd be some some topics around

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,420
you know next steps with eight with the

00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,180
GUI next steps around a charm store and

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,220
and what we can do with juju we're

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,410
starting to look at even topics around

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,690
big data I know that's a big buzz word

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:45,450
all the time but juju you know allows

00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,950
you to be able to deploy complex

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,650
solutions very quickly scale them very

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,510
rapidly and share them and and big data

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:57,220
plays a huge role in a lot of these

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:59,380
solutions and I think that's pretty much

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,120
it i mean we you know the I think

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,380
there's pretty full track looking

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,820
through all the rest of them I mean I'm

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,650
pretty pretty impressed to be honest

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,670
with but how many cloud and DevOps traps

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,870
we have but um yeah I you know if you

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,430
want to participate I would you know I

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,740
hope you do i hope you want to join in

00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,690
there's a lot going on on the server

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,220
cloud front i know it's very easy to get

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,900
excited by the phone i get excited by

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,790
the phone I still run the phone I

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,780
haven't fully committed over like twix

00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,860
but I could use it but I can't but only

00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,520
we know we're doing some exciting things

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:33,490
around on the cloud server side but once

00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,740
it brings you now is enacted level that

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,780
that we wanted it to be in a sense info

00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,370
I've being recognized at a full-blown

00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,320
server OS obviously were based on a

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,000
great server OS debian there should be

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,350
no sir it's probably no surprise to to

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,990
to most of the folks at kin in these

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:49,240
sessions but to the outside i think some

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,070
folks still would only see a circle

00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,620
analyst and go and are presently

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,630
surprised now that we made such inroads

00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,990
into being there a great server

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:05,280
Cleverley and with that i'm done on Anna

00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:08,950
Michael all right Thank You Robbie I

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,900
hope we've given you all an idea of what

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,880
to expect for the next three days and

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,660
got you excited to come and be a part of

please save those for the detailed

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,419
sessions like I said everything we were

00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:27,970
talking about this hour we'll have more

00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:30,070
in-depth discussions happening over the

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:34,000
next three days so save your questions

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:37,149

the next session starts so take that

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,360
time to go look through the schedule and

00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:44,649
mark any sessions that you want to

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,649
