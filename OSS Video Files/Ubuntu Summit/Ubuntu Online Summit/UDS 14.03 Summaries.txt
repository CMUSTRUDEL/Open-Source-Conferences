00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,760
going to go through the usual motions of

00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,330
checking that people can actually see us

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,480

today and then we're going to get into

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,420
the summaries ah this is always by far

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,450
the most exciting part of one of these

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,950
video Casas watching me typing and

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,950
waiting for someone to say hello back

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,100
when you just double check myself to see

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,680
if the strings up and running oh ok so I

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,739
like it in my voice okay all right looks

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,460
like we're good so um hi everyone

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,960
welcome to the ubuntu developer summit

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,550
track summaries my name is John Regan

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,760
how economical is equal to community

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,280
manager I'm joined by a veritable bounty

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,420
of brilliance in the form of Daniel

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,949
holdback I've asked him if you could

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,899
provide the community summary today

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,740
Jason Warren is going to provide the

00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:13,649
client side Leon August awara is going

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,079
to provide the the core and Michael

00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:17,759
halls going to be providing the the app

00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,170
developer side of things and then we've

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,090
also got back down is going to be

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,899
joining us to provide the summary for

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,380
the for the cloudless server

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,200
unfortunately are not going to have a

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,119
summary for the design track today the

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,409
design lead could unfortunately make it

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,479
for the session but we'll be providing

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,789
other updates on that so why don't we

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,770
get right into it if anybody's got any

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,810
questions feel free to type them into

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,310
IRC and if there's an appropriate time

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,659
I'll read them out but we're going to

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,270
mainly stick to the summaries today so

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,259
why don't we kick off with Jason with

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,569
the with the client track summary all

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,520
right thanks general hi everybody i'm

00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,409
jason warner i'm being a bum to desktop

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,659
manager and i will be summarizing the

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,429
client track for you now the client

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,829
track covers quite a bit of ground we

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:03,809
cover not only the desktop but also a

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,659
lot of the higher level items and the

00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:08,789
phone and tablet so a lot of touch as

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,619
well and so where we are in this cycle

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,740
is we're basically in the home stretch

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,630
1404 so desktop related items

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,220
going to be more about polish and touch

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,410
up at this point so we've taken some

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,930
minor decisions but there's quite a bit

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,610
of ground that was covered in the touch

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,400
oriented things so I'll cover all those

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,530
so from a desktop perspective we talked

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,810
a lot about unity 7 defaults whether

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,280
limbs locally integrated menu should be

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,430
on by the fall tour we should stick with

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,380
global menus as well as what we should

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,180
do about the high DPI auto scaling

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,320
things like that and a lot of these

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,950
areas we basically said we want more

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,490
information we want to go back work with

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,720
Charlene in the focus groups and get out

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,670
in front of users and see what they

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,430
think about these things and what we

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,380
should do in that case so we've taken

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,710
the decision to go back gather more data

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,880
and come back with a stronger decision

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,200
back with actual data moving on from you

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,570
seven will talk about you and II ate

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,040
nearly 80 as everyone knows when we

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,800
kicked out 1404 we talked about a

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,600
preview session for unity 8 and that is

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,540
on track for our 1404 release to have a

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,910
unity 8 preview session and the greeter

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,030
so that would be available for everyone

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,360
to try out and the repository you would

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,820
just apt-get install it and see how

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,590
unity on the desktop is progressing and

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,050
obviously this is important to us for a

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,030
lot of different reasons but mostly for

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:45,410
the 1604 convergence story in that vein

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,910
we also have a lot of touch applications

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,110
that need to work on the desktop they

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,480
currently work on the phone and the

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,890
tablet and we wanted them to work on the

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,950
desktop just as well as they work there

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,690
so we've taken some action items to

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,470
clean up how those would work on the

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,450
desktop so we've identified a core set

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,070
of applications core set of

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,110
functionality in those applications that

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,940
need to work and we've talked about the

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:13,230
SDK changes that need to be there to

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,690
allow those to work so as you can see

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,980
from the desktop side it's not so much

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,450
about what we will be doing for the next

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,520
couple years it's about what we got to

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,790
do for the homestretch of forking up for

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,280
on the touch side it's more about the

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,510
bigger changes so for instance in touch

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,450
we talked a lot about

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,600
push notifications content hub unity 8

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,250
I'm touch as well as the new scopes that

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,290
everyone's probably hearing about the

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:43,230
blogosphere so in those tracks and those

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,510
sessions it's about what's coming the

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,520
API changes how things are going to

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,830
integrate what applications need to be

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,900
sure how applications need to be changed

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,090
to adapt to those new api's or call outs

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,200
so there's a lot of good stuff here and

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,090
I encourage people to go back and

00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,270
actually watch those sessions to see

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:03,030
them the highlights here for the the

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,940
touch sessions are going to be uni 8

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,210
we've got a the new split greater we've

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,070
got the right edge working and some

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,280
enhancements to the dash along with all

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,750
that scope work that we previewed it at

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,860
mwc it's going to be landing here in the

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,360
touch images within the next two weeks

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,010
so you can see how that's going to

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,470
relate to the enhanced experience on

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:29,430
touch in addition to that we talked

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,470
about web browser support on the touch

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,510
images and a lot of work has been done

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,490
in this front with it something we

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,860
called oxide which is the chromium

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,200
content API that's available on a PPA

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,420
right now people to test and that will

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:47,880
be landing on the touch images in a

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,290
matter of weeks I'm personally pretty

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,940
excited about all the changes that are

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,800
coming to the touch image all these

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,900
things are are great and you know I'm

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,970
running proposed on my phone so I love

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,740
to see these things and but i can't wait

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,280
for everyone to get get there and see

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,850
them so that's pretty much it from the

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,890
client track I think we can basically

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,650
say at this point that the home stretch

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:15,920
1404 is pretty exciting and that I hope

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:19,320
everyone is using trustee and thanks

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,410
thanks Jason so why don't we move on to

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,260
Leanne he's going to provide an update

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,270
about the call alright thanks John oh so

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,160
for our core track this time around

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,590
we're fairly lean in terms of overall

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,660
number of sessions but we still had

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,730
really focused into still conversations

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,010
nonetheless so we started the week off

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,400
with our Hardware naval mustachio L

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,440
notification

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,360
session so with the 1204 point releases

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,580
we started introducing new hard when a

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,380
woman stacks we're always conscious that

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,780
some of those stacks would have shorter

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,460
support windows so the goal that session

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,590
was to really come to an agreement about

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,020
one to begin delivering hardware naval

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,090
men stack notification UL notifications

00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,350
and precise how the notifications would

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,389
be delivered and then assigning

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,669
appropriate owners for each task and

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,650
then the session participants discussed

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:07,660
you know desktop server and OEM use

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,389
cases and they agreed to update manager

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,370
modifications motd messaging us n

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,410
announcements etc and they're going to

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,510
continue to sync on an ongoing basis on

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,770
surrounding that following that session

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,350
we had some really interesting

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,660
discussions on init system transitions

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,510
particularly our move from upstart to

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,970
system B so with Debbie and selection of

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,949
system d at the default and knit for

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,770
Linux systems that time seems to have

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,500
come to for us to sort of follow suit so

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,960
we're no rush to transition here but we

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,060
will be making every effort not to

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,340
destabilize a boon to along the way but

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,830
it's bound to be a complicated exercise

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,229
given how extensively extensively we use

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,690
upstarts so as well as the obvious

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,370
things like translate translating all

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,500
known upstart jobs to equivalent system

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,360
d units and doing extensive validation

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,280
work across various configurations with

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
system being a PPA we're going to be

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,110
experimenting with using upstart as a

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,729
helper in it both in the short term to

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,440
smooth the upgrade process and then in

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,139
the longer term for compatibility with

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,460
locally defined jobs so our target

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,460
really at the moment is to be

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,430
comfortably on system d by the 1604 LTS

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,680
release a follow-on session to that was

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,630
discussing how session in its could be

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
migrated to system d as well so we

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,190
currently use upstart as a session

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,919
manager on both the desktop and phone so

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,229
we can't migrate session start up to

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,479
system d until the system migration is

00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,190
done so it's a different kind of

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,779
complexity involved so we have fewer

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,880
jobs but there's some things that are

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:40,089
going to be more complex like unity aids

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,890
application life cycle management so we

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,450
don't see any obvious blockers to this

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,339
work though and we've confirmed that

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,170
system DS kernel version requirements

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,360
are functionally the same as upstarts

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,740
for the purposes of the phone but it

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,750
looks as though is we should be able to

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,260
handle this and an all-or-nothing

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,820
convert

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,980
and rather than trying to run both and

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,290
it's in parallel and then in addition to

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,270
that we can decouple the ongoing Katie

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,950
best discussions for this work as it's

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,620
still a technology preview and not

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,140
production ready we also saw a good

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,210
discussions about reviewing the booty

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,430
touch landing process and the CI airline

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,350
and CI train frameworks the goal for

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,750
that session was to have people walk

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,160
away and embrace and understanding an

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,080
idea that you know the code that's

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,820
committed and checked into trunk really

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,950
reflects what's available in the archive

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,590
they also reviewed the different roles

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,780
in terms of lander and leading our

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,730
landing team and then how those guys

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,740
work together to get a green baseline so

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,660
starting you know the image build an

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,000
image testing and handling regressions

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,210
and bug fixes and they really identified

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,370
an area and there in terms of they could

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,080
get it in a loop of you know trying to

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,190
fix regressions but then new ones coming

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,020
in so they spent the rest of that

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,180
session trying to discuss how to improve

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,910
and streamline that image building

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,370
process we also had our usual networking

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,810
health check that cipher mocks LED and

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,920
discussed various plans for upgrading

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,560
parts of the network stack so I

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,290
encourage you to look at his um etherpad

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,540
notes there for a finer grain level of

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,910
details there's also some cute five

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,730
versioning discussions and particularly

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,070
about how the cute 50 to 52 transition

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,900
was a bit painful this cycle and so we

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,180
had three main points coming out of that

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,040
that we can use to sort of improve on

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,420
the next time around so the first was

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,220
invest in tools and automation that

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,410
allows us to start tracking upstream

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,700
development trees proactively in order

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,980
to work with the cute engineering teams

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,390
and then gather requirements from

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,730
stakeholders before the start of the

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,230
cycle and sure we have constant priority

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,880
on working towards a regression free

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,250
landing from day one and then the third

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,780
point was to make a call before feature

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,600
freeze on whether the cute version

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,020
targeted for kabuto is suitable for

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,120
landing in touch in time there's also a

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,280
really popular session that we had

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,580
around the glue to touch platform beyond

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,710
1404 the two main goals that were

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,780
discussed in that session world's first

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,520
ensuring that our touch codebase can

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,680
continue to flow freely into trusty

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,920
which would allow our unity a preview

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,350
session to be consumable for LTS users

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,630
up until the next LTS release and then

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,490
the

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,140
and goal to nail down our stable channel

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,300
story needed to deliver a good to touch

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,820
images in products delivered the market

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,650
so there's an action on a cross team

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,710
task force consisting of the foundations

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,930
foundations and pest teams to find ways

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,240
to allow short-lived stabilization

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,490
stabilization branches based on blessed

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,410
daily release images that would then go

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,570
sort of the last mile independently from

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,730
the main development push being done by

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,230
Ubuntu engineers in the developed and

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,150
then in addition to that as agreed that

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,100
until we have real products in the

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,770
market we can point our stable series to

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,950
our de Bellas are daily release product

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,470
delivers quality images for enthusiasts

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,490
and then today we just had some

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,510
informational sessions around click

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,370
framework handling to wreak lat recap

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,190
plans around api and api versioning

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,530
based version split split and frameworks

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,890
and then storing client support and then

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:04,280
we also saw a session demoing sort of

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:06,110
carrier OEM customizations and what they

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,640
have in terms of today for what's

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,980
customized and how new customization

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,200
tarballs could be created and tools and

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,580
docks are developed so they also threw

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,770
out a call for help there from anybody

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,260
in the community looking to help

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,330
implement some missing features we also

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,980
saw a session about handling hardware

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,810
configurations from the Android image

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,760
files and so discussions there were

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,640
about overall system design whether to

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,500
use tarballs partitions overlays or loop

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,290
mounted devices and they came up with a

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,180
plan to categorize the affected config

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,890
files and maintain them in the android

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,600
tree and then a proper solution to apply

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,160
them to the root of s during install and

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,710
upgrades of the phone and then we

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,670
wrapped up our track today with a talk

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,770
about improving the boot experience for

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,410
high DPI displays and so monitors with

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,910
high pixel density really need to have

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,130
everything rendered a bit larger so that

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,020
it's legible so the it sounds like the

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,230
unity team has a plan to address this um

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,690
for the desktop and 1404 but that leaves

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,340
the grub boot menu and the Plymouth

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,170
splash screen unscaled so they really

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,500
discussed you know deep high DPI and

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,330
scaling of the grub boot menu Plymouth

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,100
splash virtual console fonts and then

00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,040
how to reliably detect physical

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,380
dimensions without using X and that was

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,020
it for our core track

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,610
wonderful thank you ma'am so next up why

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,460
don't we shift over to pack who's going

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:32,720
to provide is with a summary of cloud

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:36,090
and so very cool um so so it was a very

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,950
like like Liam said we tried not to do a

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,350
lot of sessions but I feel it the

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,510
sessions that we did do really high

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,930
quality a lot of a lot of really good

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,330
discussions and some great like you know

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,960
next steps and things to do so our first

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,970
session was death um we had the guys

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,320
from steph join us and we talked a bit

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,260
about the current release which is

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,730
called codename firefly and those for

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,800
those of you that keep track of code

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,170
names the next one is giant and then

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
after that it's hammer so just you know

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,140
for those that like to know that sort of

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,680
stuff so I think we're positioned really

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,200
well for 14 or for the major features we

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,780
ended in a 13-3 13 colonel so that

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,700
aligns really well and then we talked

00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,360
about some of the major features of the

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,150
Firefly release which is erasure coding

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,390
tearing and IO hinting watch watch this

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,000
watch the video for more information I I

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,210
thought it was also great they talked

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,650
about kind of when you Swift versus when

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,970
do you Seth I thought that was a really

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,420
good discussion too so I think

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,990
definitely the Seth video is worth

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,910
having a onus into next we talked about

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,700
entropy gustan came and talked to us

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,960
from South by Southwest so I got to hear

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,240
a little bit of the South by Southwest

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,630
noise in the background I won't respond

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,610
it's in it's enabled by default in cloud

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,000
images and it's using entropy top

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,860
canonical com so that's really good so

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,010
that was the end of the first day second

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:09,030
day we had a discussion about network

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,650
consistency and robustness and and

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,190
really a lot of those question was about

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,870
the need to document what you know what

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,000
are the tools that you should be doing

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,070
what is the expected behavior what

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,250
should people be seeing when they go to

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,570
restart the networking while the system

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,270
is running versus what they should

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,200
expect to see upon a reboot so to

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,980
document that and then also to document

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,230
what are the current net

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,090
network permutations that are tested

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,530
today I think people there were some

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,820
discussion about hey should it be doing

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,420
this shouldn't should it be doing that

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,520
the answer was file a bug so definitely

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,900
encouraging people do that I thought

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,060
that there's a lot of good discussion

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,680
there too I'm probably going to say that

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,710
a lot there's a lot of good discussion

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,080
so I'm on the databases side which is

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,960
our next topic I was really really

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,920
pleased with how this when we had really

00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,410
good cross mysql participation we had we

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,900
had people from percona folks from ryan

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,650
be oracle community members they all

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:13,020
came in and talked it was a really good

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,060
cross community discussion between a lot

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,510
of the major major players in this area

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:22,140
and I can you know definitely worthless

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,870
listen so the net is MySQL five dot five

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,300
and five dot six are in for trustee

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,960
Mariah to be 55 and percona extra DB

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,800
cluster 55 is in annum Raya DB the

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:38,820
pakona extra TV cluster is is our our

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,620
MySQL solution for 4h a story so I

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,120
thought it was great we talked about

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,590
having a follow-up session and may I

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,080
think we're going to do kind of an out

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,610
of cycle Google on-air hang out during

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,110
together all the major players it's kind

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,550
of talk about what we want to go from

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,750
here focused on it 14-10 in future

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,100
direction and there's also talk of

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,350
trying to figure out how to bring

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,030
together a face-to-face meeting later

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,520
than you or one of you know one of the

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,490
various conferences that happen so

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,130
really good discussion Nexus openstack

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,990
charms there's a lot of work that still

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,360
in flight but we've got some great new

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,370
features including ssl everywhere and

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,200
after that a DJ so that's that's good

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:24,080
OpenStack on ice house is shaping up

00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:29,210
nicely beta threes and test in trustee

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:33,390
so what we need from everybody is use it

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,430
try it test it file bugs reach out if it

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,290
doesn't do what you think it should do

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:44,580
if it if in doubt a file a defective bug

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:46,890
is a what we want so get using it

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,760
um and then our final session we had a

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:54,809
meeting to discuss mass hardware

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,470
enablement and there's a lot of work

00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:00,929
that is um through meaning and they

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,309
filed a future freeze exception and the

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,380
first thing we're going to really focus

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,120
on the thing we're really focused on for

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,809
the very short term is being able to do

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,220
arbitrary kernels so um yeah so so that

00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,890
was kind of the server side of house so

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,250
overall this is my this is my net to you

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,010
guys use trustee yeah who's icehouse

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,590
check it out file bugs if it doesn't do

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,750
what you think it should so um please

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,429
just use it I think you guys got that

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,100
message for mark yesterday about using

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,230
trustee so I want to reiterate that on

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,960
the DG sine of the house the big

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:39,419
headline is juju 1 da 2 18's is incoming

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:42,350
414 for and got manual providers in

00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:45,980
giant providers that the high as

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,480
availability is also lending for 1404

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,179
bundles is coming so that's the ability

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,250
to play entire set of charms in one go

00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,440
the feature is already indeed you poor

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,570
and the charm bunk bundles are starting

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,880
to live in the store as I've sticky so

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,590
quick start is is there and that allows

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960
you to set up multiple clouds through an

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,480
end courses interface it's really pretty

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,760
awesome so you should definitely check

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,330
it out and then the GUI there's lots of

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,450
changes try it and you can try it in the

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,039
sandbox that you charms calm oh and one

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,870
of the things I want to mention backing

00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,830
up to the bundles is there's charm

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,019
school tomorrow at two o'clock 2 p.m.

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,419
eastern and pound juju if you want to

00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,760
learn how to use make and share bundles

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,639
so I encourage you to do that if you're

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,639
interested and then I charm audits there

00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:41,820
about fifteen percent complete so it's

00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:43,769
going pretty well um 130 plus services

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,779
are ready to employ including popular

00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:49,289
favorites like MongoDB clusters to do

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:51,260
Cassandra openstax F mysql with a

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,720
master-slave support postgresql

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,690
elasticsearch with blog stat and Cabana

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,870
jenkins apache syncopate in tomcat that

00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,880
is

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,370
and varnish and then finally there's a

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,710
lot of updates to GG dots since the last

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:09,600
via tds so check that out at GG dot

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:17,970
ubuntu com / docs and Jo know that it

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:21,510
for me thanks Pat okay so next up let's

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:25,440
move over to Michael who's going to give

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,400
us an update about the app developer a

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,809
lot of activity on this one this week

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,309
yeah was it full schedule for us I

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,000
didn't even make it to half of online

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:39,059
gap to go back and watch some videos

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,179
alright to start off we had a html5 SDK

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:45,020
road map where they they've had a lot of

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:48,720
possible refinements to the html5 story

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:51,809
including layouts to make it easy for

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,270
app developers to use convergent layouts

00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,760
in their html5 app if they're not using

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,790
an existing solution but if they already

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,200
are using something that html5 and CSS

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,110
provide we're going to stay out of their

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,410
way we're going to integrate the

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:11,730
JavaScript API with the auto completion

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,830
in the ubuntu sdk is a new app platform

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,400
api to surface in javascript there's

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,380
going to be a app lifecycle state saver

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,660
content hub is getting refactored the

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,580
media service and download manager URL

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,400
dispatcher bunch of stuff that's

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,550
available in qml is coming to html5 soon

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,820
also there was evidently talk about an

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:36,510
html5 corps app for the ubuntu 1410

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,520
cycle so that's exciting and they talked

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,080
about how to support

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,059
internationalization in html5 apps

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,210
there's more discussion that needs to

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:48,960
happen there and they're going to have

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,929
another html5 active feedback meeting so

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,370
if you're in html5 app developer and you

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:58,110
want to give us some feedback get with

00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:00,179
them Kyle and David Piniella and Daniel

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,730
Holbach and I to figure out when those

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,160
meetings are going to be they had a

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,810
session on testing html5 apps where they

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,750
discussed possible unit testing

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,120
solutions debugging tools how to do

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,490
acceptance testing

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,490
measure performance and what kind of

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,780
documentation we need around that so

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,640
this needs more discussion but

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,650
recommendations will be documented and

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,710
access to the tools will be implemented

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,809
through the SDK for application

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,330
development best practices they

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,430
discussed best practices to follow when

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,309
writing an application for the SDK how

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,780
to set up your development environment

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,640
writing and running tests including

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,340
options for continuous integration a

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,190
good release process they showcased some

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,350
profiling work discussed how to use the

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,250
cube profiler which is built into Q

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,809
creator and information gleaned will be

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,230
posted in a series of guides on

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:56,120
developer ubuntu com testing the

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,679
workflow for app developer app

00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,720
developers they discussed an ideal

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,030
workflow for app developers for from a

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,370
testing perspective walking through the

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,410
process of writing testing and releasing

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,640
an application to the store they

00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,429
identified some areas for improvement

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,500
there this includes better templates for

00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,510
new projects easier test provisioning

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,250
and execution as well as further a mule

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:22,760
further emulator and store integration

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:25,670
this week Alan Pope had all of the core

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,670
apps meetings that usually are on IRC he

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:33,170
did those as UDS sessions so for the

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:35,150
weather app they planned on 1404 feature

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:38,360
completed after the work done for mwc

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:41,330
which is convergence for the Nexus 4

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,270
Nexus 7 Nexus 10 and the weather channel

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,280
backends which they've also got upcoming

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,190
work planned on refining the convergent

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,370
designs and improving the tests they had

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,020
a full core eps review session in

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,580
general all the core apps are in good

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,710
shape there are three apps that are

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,200
already convergent on phone and tablet

00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:03,290
that's the clock app reminders and

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,179
whether the calendar team is looking for

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,980
new contributors so if anyone wants to

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,220
get involved in the core eps projects

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,690
which has been a great way for people to

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,350
learn a bunch web development as well as

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,540
get a lot of exposure contact Alan Pope

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,970
Pope be on IRC to get involved with the

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,310
calendar app the focus in the coming

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,470
weeks is including the reminders app in

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,150
the device images

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,760
requires some auto pilot test for that

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,669
to happen finnish convergence across the

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,549
core apps migrate the music app to the

00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:37,730
new media hub and media scanner backends

00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:40,059
and to implement calendar syncing in the

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,100
calendar app which will be nice to have

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,289
we discussed the release process for the

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,460
SDK and how we can improve that the

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,350
result of that is that we're going to

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,440
separate the developer tools from the

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,510
runtime packages so the developers can

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,980
target a specific release of the

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,940
framework that's different from their

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:02,179
host environment so if you're on precise

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,700
on 1204 you can still target the trustee

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,679
when you're writing your application the

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,210
SDK will use click change routes and the

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,580
emulator to support these different

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,080
runtimes and that will relieve the SDK

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,419
team from having to backport those

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,940
runtimes to older a bun two releases to

00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:20,059
support them this will also make it

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:24,380
easier in the future to provide the bun

00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:29,570
to sdk on other linux distros mac OS x

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:31,700
and windows app developers there we had

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,919
a bunch o SDK integrated development

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,140
environment session where we talked

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,179
about what's coming into the IDE q

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,549
creator we're going to be upgrading the

00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:42,980
q creator 3 soon which will bring

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:46,120
support for cute designer which is the

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,070
drag-and-drop GUI editor in q creator

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,350
there's some see make plugin fixes to

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,650
click change rate support automatic

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,480
execution of cmake and creating and

00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,130
loading a new project this is going to

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,950
be support for multiple frameworks I

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,299
think LeAnn mentioned this during hers

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:08,240
but we're going to add a new ubuntu 1404

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:09,559
framework to our app development so the

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,850
SDK is going to get support for that

00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,010
it's going to prompt you when you create

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,350
a new project we're going to have

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,390
support for Q creator kits which let you

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,570
target different build and run

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,940
environment since IQ creator and also

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,510
x86 an emulator integration which will

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,700
improve performance the Scopes

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,830
documentation is going to be getting a

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,110
big refreshed it'll be landing soon it's

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,179
going to need changes to the developer

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,779
portal documentation and the tools

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,669
around it we're going to get

00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,039
update to the architectural overview and

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:44,049
general documentation on the website the

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,059
tutorials will be updated extensive

00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,609
documentation on remote scopes will be

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:50,469
added we'll be adding documentation on

00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:53,559
the submission process for both local

00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:55,149
and remote scopes there will be a local

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,729
scope template and cute creator will be

00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:59,440
updated to the new API and cue Creator

00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:03,700
will provide integration with the Scopes

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,979
testing tool the API website had a few

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,139
sessions this week one to go over

00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:10,769
different improvements that need to go

00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:13,330
into the website itself including

00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:16,330
posting images from the documentation

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,450
and improvements to the importer that we

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:22,029
have we also talked about a component

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,129
store where people can upload reusable

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:25,479
bits of code for people to put into

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:28,029
their apps and we're going to prototype

00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:30,849
that on top of the app developer website

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:34,239
and we're also going to host a version

00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:37,779
of the API website for unity so internal

00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:42,369
unity api's for unity developers will be

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:43,839
hosted on this the software store team

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,659
give us an update on where things stand

00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,489
and what's going to land next coming up

00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:51,039
is going to be automatic inspection and

00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:52,450
scanning of click packages so when you

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,099
submit an app you don't need to give it

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,659
a name and description and everything

00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,479
it'll grab all that from the clip

00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:00,339
package that you upload support for the

00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:02,080
new 1404 framework like I mentioned

00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:04,839
earlier there's going to be a way to

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,919
report abusive apps and also ratings and

00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:10,479
reviews should be coming online soon

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,369
during the collapse testing review they

00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:14,349
reviewed and discuss best practices for

00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:16,599
work or at tests discuss how the

00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:19,089
conversion to package object model is

00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,609
working for core apps organized work

00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:23,919
around working around issues affecting

00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:26,109
all tests they need to focus on lower

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,599
level testing dependencies on external

00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:32,559
services and updating tests to use new

00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,119
SDK helpers the Ubuntu UI toolkit has

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,679
some new components that just recently

00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:40,929
landed including Anna bunt list view and

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,029
performance metrics overlay those API

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,179
Doc's are now updated on the developer

00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:48,009
portal API pages and we also identified

00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,479
several components that people would

00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:51,160
find useful and we're going to try and

00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:55,690
target those for

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:58,900
14 0 14 dot 10 development cycle in the

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,640
community design showcase there's a new

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,290
community design team that we've formed

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,020
around the core apps where we're getting

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,720
designers to focus on individual apps at

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,970
a time and give us some design and put

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,580
on that to augment the canonical

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,990
designers who have been working on this

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,820
they showcase the designs the team has

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,810
been working on across all the core apps

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:21,570
and upcoming plans for them our new

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,540
visual designs for the reminders app

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:28,350
convergent design for the music app and

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:31,090
design improvements for calendar

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,220
Thursday had most of the core rap

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,980
sessions so the music app they've

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,510
removed cute power D dependencies which

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,460
was what it was using to play in the

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,290
background they took a pragmatic

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,030
approach to redesign the individual

00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,090
features rather than a wholesale a

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,520
pre-designed from top down they migrated

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,350
to media hub or planning on migrating to

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,230
media hub which is what's going to

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,990
replace the power D plug-in that they

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,030
had they've got convergent designs that

00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,600
they're working on implementing last.fm

00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,490
scrobbler support via online accounts

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,500
improved real world and mock testing

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,950
rather than testing with just three

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,450
audio files and more long-range planning

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,850
for the bottom edge and cool bar

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,940
redesign there was a design session on

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,560
the bottom edge changes that are going

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,670
to affect the core apps and music is

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,550
going to be I think one of the first

00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,620
ones to start doing that the calendar

00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:27,370
app they finalized sync calendar

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,810
selection design and implementation for

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,760
when you have multiple calendars that

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,630
you want to sync they're finishing off

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,550
keyboard navigation for desktop usage

00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,440
they landed the agenda view for the

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,110
upcoming events and date and time

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,830
spinner fixed Bitesize bugs identified

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:47,860
by review of apps by carriers the

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,620
calculator app is reliably running only

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,050
on slides reliably run the calculator

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,540
only on the side stage in tablet instead

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,870
of on the main stage analyzing fixed

00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,940
side stage bugs enable copy and paste in

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,890
the calculator and fix problems with the

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,690
calculator on desktop not having an

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,489
on-screen keyboard for typing in the

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,080
label

00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,580
the reminders app they plan on getting

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,980
reminders on the default image I

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,799
mentioned earlier they're going to add

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,389
better support for no or slow network

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,759
connections when it's trying to retrieve

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:20,649
them from Evernote they're going to

00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,090
enable the use of trusted helpers for

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:25,090
launching online accounts where no

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:28,090
Evernote account exists to get users set

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,559
up for the first time we had a couple of

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,019
sessions on the developer portal

00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,090
documentation the result of that is

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:37,539
we're going to add some more examples to

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,429
some of the important api's to explain

00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,379
better how they should be used we're

00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:43,720
going to add some short tutorials to get

00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:46,389
developers started without going into a

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,249
real lengthy process and we're going to

00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:50,350
deal with documentation requests in a

00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:52,539
structured way so people can tell us

00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,179
what documentation they feel is missing

00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:57,309
from the site and we can appropriately

00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:00,869
track that and prioritize it and get

00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,980
those documentation get the docs written

00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:04,659
we're going to add more guides and

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,029
tutorials this was some of the feedback

00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:09,820
that we've gotten um we're going to add

00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,340
feedback links to both ask a bun to and

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,340
a mailing list where people can let us

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,769
know when they encounter problems with

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,879
any of the documentation on the site now

00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,460
we're also going to set up a series of

00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:24,609
dock days to resolve bugs based on

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:28,539
feedback and picks up the qml docks and

00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:30,279
finally we had a storage API session

00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,519
where we talked about the state saver

00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,999
work being done to allow procession and

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,960
now a permanent state saving the UN DB

00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:43,989
work that's being done to get syncing to

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,450
start working and finish off the

00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:48,279
functionality around that and there's a

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,009
new settings API that will be coming

00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,499
soon that will make it easy for you to

00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:55,840
store app settings that will be landing

00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:58,149
first in a new experimental components

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,720
package that we're going to create which

00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:04,090
will let us make new API is available to

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,269
test and preview before they land in the

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,119
stable SDK and then finally we had a

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:12,700
discussion on the app developer portal

00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:16,389
itself and where we can take it in the

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,429
future beyond the limitations we've run

00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:22,029
into with WordPress

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:26,559
so that's it from the API her from the

00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:29,289
app developer side thank you Mike okay

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,549
we'll wrap up with with dining hall back

00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:37,629
he's going to give us a summary of the

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:39,909
community track no no um yeah we had a

00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:43,450
fun selection of sessions in the

00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:45,879
community track were supporting both the

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:50,049
QA teams the app developer teams and

00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:51,669
where lots of other sessions first we

00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:54,340
had a session about app development

00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:57,820
schools so we want to have a number of

00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,820
events teaching new contributors had to

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,549
write apps and ramping up towards a

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,289
bunch of global jam and be able to 1404

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:08,800
release will work with the local

00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:11,619
communities our sdk and app development

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,409
engineers and local enthusiasts to live

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:17,169
at least 10 additional app deaf school

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,809
events and as part of the initiative we

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:23,970
will improve by docs and materials and

00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:26,770
have trained the trainers events and

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,799
there was a session about growing a new

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:33,159
generation of ubuntu leaders some of the

00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:35,770
ideas which were discussed there were to

00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,619
do more leadership training have

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:41,980
mentoring to better explain the best

00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:45,280
practices in teams record and distribute

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:50,470
videos and also add these materials to

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:54,010
the food to advocacy get there was a

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:56,409
quality community roundtable and they're

00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,380
the team discussed changes to QA

00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,809
processes used by would recycle with the

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,390
introduction of the CI trained and they

00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:09,579
gathered ideas on the documentation

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,190
needs for developer would to come there

00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:14,200
was an interesting session about

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:20,559
automating the creation of screencasts

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:23,799
for for help documentation and the idea

00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:27,400
was to use the new mill screencast API

00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:29,589
and tools which just landed which will

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,240
allow recording video directly from

00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:34,180
Mel's office

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,610
on a device or emulator and this will

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,580
allow the work to begin on automating

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:47,070
video creation it was a session about

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:50,140
online summit but you'd yes and there

00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:53,740
the ideas were discussed you change the

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,869
name to go to online submit it would

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,940
still happen every three months it would

00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:02,530
continue to use some it going to come

00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:05,770
and interesting change would be to break

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:09,070
the event into multiple mini summit some

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:12,520
its each with a summit lead and also to

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,940
have two time zones Western and the

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:21,250
eastern and the summits can fit within

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:23,200
those time zones and there were

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,770
additional discussions around the

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,100
technology to be used and google+

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:32,020
hangouts but with a favorite but there

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,830
are some countries where with those no

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:41,470
don't really work well so we need to see

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:43,840
but what can be used them and the idea

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:52,020
was also to have the usual discussion

00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:55,500
sessions but also demo sessions and I

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:59,440
think Michael mentioned this one already

00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,060
was in the community track the would

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,320
develop a portal but I configure can

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:09,580
expand a little bit on it and we want to

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,440
support translations better enable

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,130
developer portal and also get a firmer

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,800
grip on the dock publishing process so

00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,920
open up for for contributions from from

00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,130
outside have peer review do automated

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,880
testing and potentially produce other

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:30,460
output formats and for that we are going

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,240
to do some prototyping because we had a

00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:36,880
number of different options and then

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,400
make a decision based on estimates how

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,720
long it's going to take to to do the

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,890
move but determined to to allows you to

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,410
move quicker we

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:51,580
we're going to need a change at some

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:56,020
stage and last but not least there was a

00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:58,450
session about a auto pilot and the team

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,820
discussed plan features for auto pilot

00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:07,510
125 and took feature requests for

00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:10,690
improvements that's it alright thanks

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,270
Dale and with that I guess we're pretty

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:17,230
much about done unfortunately Jason had

00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:20,050
to take off as we mentioned we reinforce

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,480
you don't have a design summary because

00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,820
our trap laid there Christina of course

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,380
you can join the session but from what I

00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,760
can tell there was a lot of really

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,860
positive discussions it was a lot of

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,360
talk about the bottom edge and how I've

00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,280
developers can use the bottom edge and

00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,720
that the new header designs that have

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,000
been there couldn't be implemented as

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,880
well so all in all I think it's been a

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,860
tremendously productive a couple of days

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,030
big thank you to everybody who joined

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,310
the sessions everyone you led the

00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,650
sessions obviously 12 fantastic track

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:51,570
leads as well and has Daniel touched on

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:55,150
in the in his summary we're going to be

00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:58,840
we're going to be evaluating the notion

00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,270
of well we're not going to be we are

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,980
going to be kind of changing the format

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,910
of you yes a little bit for the next one

00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,230
where we're going to be not just

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,050
focusing on developers but we're going

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,540
to be also attracting other parts of our

00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,190
community to have sessions as well in a

00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,260
kind of a bit more of an inclusive kind

00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:17,320
of way right now UDS is very focused on

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,610
on planning out software and development

00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,250
and things such as that and then we have

00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,360
some community related content but for

00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,130
the next one we're going to have these

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,300
kinds of mini somerset park the same

00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,210
thing so i think that's gonna be a

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,530
really interesting experiment you know

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,420
we'll still have all the same kind of

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,980
content that we have a UDS but it'll be

00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,330
it will be wider and hopefully be more

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,360
interesting to or to a wider demographic

00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,730
open to community members so with that

00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,530
in mind will everybody go and thanks

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,740
again and we'll see you soon take care

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,740
