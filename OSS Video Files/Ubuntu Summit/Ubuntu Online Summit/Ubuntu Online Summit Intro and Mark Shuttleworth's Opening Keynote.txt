talk about us how to participate and

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,620
essentially what you should expect from

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,990
room to account the summit is all

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,080
celebrating with just the with a

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,840
released our 23rd released one the one

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
that marks the 11th anniversary of or

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,409
kabuto and as we always say it's our

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:43,189
best released so far so us is a place to

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:46,170
to learn what you can do with wire load

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,659
to learn what how you can use the

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,840
developer tools how we can contribute to

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,259
the to the release and how to shape the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,610
plans for the next for the next release

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:02,700
which takes me to the room to 1604 1604

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,069
is going to be our next LTS long-term

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,869
really support distribution and what

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,840
you'll hear you at us will be too

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,930
to recurring themes that will

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,920
essentially shape the road to 1604 n

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,620
beyond 12 is everywhere hold on to his

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,319
wickedness you can find it on clouds on

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:33,459
servers on phones on laptops and on all

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,909
kinds of devices essentially a winter is

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,579
everywhere not just in terms of it being

00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,590
installable and on any of these these

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:44,109
devices that also and because we're

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,290
working on convergence little

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:49,120
convergence we talk about essentially

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,069
being able to run the same operating

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,950
system you all know all off with the

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,609
same UX and with the same features that

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,909
did you expect on a desktop on on your

00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,409
personal devices such as handhelds and

00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:05,109
tablets for example so you'll hear about

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,950
Morgan desktop in these three days

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:11,560
you'll hear about ubuntu running on your

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,419
phone and essentially a phone being your

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,470
your desktop you'll hear about

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,260
convergence convergence convergence

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,760
essentially so if you're interested in

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,849
this particular topics which should be

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,049
sure to check out the sessions on the

00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:30,639
convergence track and only on the core

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,730
track of which i'm going to talk about

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,160
in a minute the online summit is a set

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,470
of obsessions you can join join online

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,459
on some incredible to have to come and

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,650
they are free you can register and you

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,340
can then participating in these hangouts

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,579
either as a spectator or joining to

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,919
cooperate we've got a series of topics

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,260
which run along series of tracks

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,230
essentially trucks group all of these

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,989
trades of contents into into one

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,120
particular theme so we've got the oven

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,870
scalded or development truck where you

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,549
will find sessions about the sdk writing

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,440
apps for going to essentially writing of

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,959
your conversion shops as well so there's

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,970
does it describe a bit of overlap as

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,780
well with converting

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,400
and I can scope development as well then

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,400
in cloud you see all of the content

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,500
about containers of juju Tobin stack of

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,710
DevOps anything that you need to know

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,980
about running a boot on on cloud and

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,860
servers as well the quarter is perhaps

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,550
one of our most new and shiny shiny ones

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,060
this all about snappy snappy is the new

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:48,120
rendition of a boom tube that has

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,520
bleedin mean core set of features that

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,260
you can install with the bare essentials

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,570
for unable to which you can then move

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,920
grow in functionality with with

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,070
applications this is the version of all

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,870
that that can run on clothes but also to

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:08,880
run on Internet of Things and devices

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:13,050
then on the convergence track it's all

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,850
about the relative conversions you see a

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,950
preview of convergent and you've ever

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,530
actually if you've been following the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,710
rule two channels you've already seen

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,419
all of the pictures the community

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,300
started to post about the first

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,270
convergence features landing so these

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,020
all about running into as a desktop from

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,229
your phone about developing you ice for

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,490
applications that run on multiple form

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,500
factors and devices and so on and the

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,880
next track to do it occurred is

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,310
community drive is all about vaca

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,290
serious about governance is about I grow

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,390
in the community in general is not just

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,150
related to one particular area of the

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,000
community or just all development it's

00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,030
it's all all around community it's all

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,320
around contributing to 212 and making

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,080
sure that that there is space for for

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,380
everyone to to join and and to discuss

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,910
how to better participate you will do

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,520
and then finally on the show and tell

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,600
track we've got all of our exciting

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,120
demos q and A's and essentially things

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,800
that might break or might not break but

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,080
lots of exciting stuff well I'm being

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,830

of our

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:40,089
learn so far then finally remember to go

it's about making making to happen it's

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,909
about participating it's about making

00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:21,419
sure that if there's a topic boring

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,709
where you interested if you like a

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,629
particular area problem to where you can

00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,189
make a difference the go in one

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,860
particular direction is difficult

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:33,969
joining sessions and these about

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,599
proposing new directions proposing new

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:43,050
proposals new new initiatives and

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:46,239
essentially making making this happen so

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,429
remember to register intermittent sammy

00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:50,649
cahn to come there you can subscribe to

00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:53,529
the possessions you're interested in and

00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:56,319
you can build your own schedule if you

00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:58,689
are participating in one session or if

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,689
you're running one session remember to

00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:03,699
promote it on on social media share news

00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,039
about it and make sure that if you need

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,319
someone to join the session you contact

00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:13,539
them in in advance to be there and

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,069
recorded session and then finally if you

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,479
are at a session if you're watching and

00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,749
if you think you can make a contribution

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,469
you can participate on IRC you can jump

00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:28,239
into the Hangout these are all life live

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:31,479
streams where you can join a talk so the

00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:34,180
encourage everyone wants to to

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,050
essentially make this happen then to to

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,259
join one of our own office Daniels and

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,919
then that's pretty much it in terms of

00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,450
judo handsome it in a nutshell

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,220
I think what I'll do now is I'll leave

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:53,240
the stage to mark shuttleworth founder

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:57,950
and both given to project and canonical

00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,880
who's there today from prac and then

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,940
he'll share um well some news and answer

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,829
the questions of the community later on

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,829
so enjoy the summit and Clank man

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:27,450

difficulties so well he's joining or

00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:04,290
trying to join again he's coming ragging

first come first serve alright welcome

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,770
back mark and I sorry about that I'm

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,380
once again dialing in from a fun part of

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:44,040
the world i'm in prague this week and so

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,640
i may not have the bandwidth that i

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,610
usually have that i hope that we can get

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,710
everything we need done can you give me

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:58,350
okay yep we can hear you fine all right

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,450
i'm just trying to bring up the

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:11,880
presentation and then we will dive off

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:15,240
dive in dive long lemme echoed some

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,540
of the point to the david made it's an

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,790
incredibly important part of the

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,380
community protest by which we map out

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,930
and and converge on goals for our

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,060
release and we do it this way because it

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,370
means that everybody can participate

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,700
everybody in the world can participate

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:39,660
they can participate the pieces that

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,670
they really care about and perhaps most

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,500
importantly there's then a public record

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,940
of everything that was said all the

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,590
commitments that were made all the

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,780
decisions that were made and how they

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,490
came to be and that anybody can watch

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,550
any time so i think it's an incredibly

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,150
transparent way for us to build

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,480
consensus on what

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:02,830
who's going to be about in the next six

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,650
months and this isn't just any six

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:08,770
months for us this is an LTS release so

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:19,000
great go here easeus is going to be just

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:22,510
to do that and that David do you have do

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,970
you have the opening slide there we can

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,460
see the slider all right right so this

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:33,220
of course isn't just any release for us

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:35,440
this is 1604 LTS and I'm going to really

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,930
pioneered the idea of declaring in

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,110
advance on a deadline that we were going

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,180
to make a long-term supported release

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,150
it's great I think that that idea has

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,570
been picked up broadly across not just

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:53,710
the the open source ecosystem but also

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,990
the proprietary ecosystem as the world

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,510
has moved much faster cadences of

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,490
software delivery and development it's

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,890
really important occasionally to pause

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,600
pull all of that together and give your

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,230
users something that they can bank on

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,990
for the next extended period and when we

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:15,120
look at data for example on the cloud as

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:19,180
to how many releases are in use in

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,180
places like AWS or the Google cloud it

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,220
is incredibly clear and that the LTS

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,900
means something to our users they really

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,250
trust it they count on it it is the

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:32,560
default platform 1404 LTS is today the

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,050
default platform for innovation not just

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,440
on the cloud but in robotics and in any

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,380
number of other important areas that

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,650
free software is the foundation for for

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,410
innovation so this next release 1604 LTS

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,580
I think is going to be just as important

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,890
as 1404 was I think it's going to be a

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:58,090
huge part of the innovation that happens

00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:00,340
in the next four years online so we all

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:04,690
have an interest in making it awesome

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,580
and to do that and in a sense and it

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,200
helps to be prepared it helps for us to

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,510
have been doing over the last couple of

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,210
these

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,280
is all of the ice breaking to to set

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:17,860
ourselves up for a great LTS and I

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:21,200
believe we have done them for us on the

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,070
impersonal computing clearly the story

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,670
is what about convergence it is very

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:31,520
reassuring and gratifying to see

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:35,030
convergence emerging across all of that

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,720
the industry as a common theme these

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,980
these devices is personal these pocket

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,850
devices that we've been carrying around

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,760
are increasingly a substitute for

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,560
full-scale personal computing and our

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,500
vision for the last four years has been

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,050
that those pocket devices become your

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,270
entry point to every kind of personal

00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,810
computer and it's really important for

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,230
us now to bring that vision home I saw

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:08,690
one of the most enthusiastic and excited

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:10,850
posts on social media recently from this

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,270
chap who spent a day playing with a

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:17,120
phone that is a PC and this is a future

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,540
that is ready to be born and it's ready

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:25,460
to be born as free software on honorable

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,350
to so I I couldn't be more excited at

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,020
the proprietary work that's been done

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,660
and how that work has come together and

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,240
how our design thinking has led us to

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:39,200
this very fluid very integrated very

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,310
coherent story for convergence and I

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,800
think we're very privileged to be

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,880
working with an extraordinary community

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,310
that has taken this idea to heart

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,970
fantastic apps emerging fantastic

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,370
innovation continuing to emerge this is

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,840
a fun place to be and it's a fun time to

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,580
be in this place it is I think going to

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,160
be a lot of fun for people to take phone

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:08,600
apps and make them work across tablets

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,180
and across the pc and all of the raw

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,910
materials all of the tools all of the

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,960
design thinking thinking now is in place

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,410
to support you if

00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:22,470
an adventure that you want to be a part

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,790
of in the next six months so to the

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,360
communities who are leading that work

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,920
thank you you're doing amazing stuff and

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,710
I think you're going to set the bar for

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,850
free software in personal computer and I

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,320
think that's something really to be

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,850
proud of something to celebrate them

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,710
something to participate in this is the

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,660
new wave of personal computing I don't

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,270
think it will stop with phones tablets

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,520
and PCs but it's really important for us

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,100
to put free software in the middle of

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,960
that in the middle of that wave you know

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,180
people innovate with the tools that they

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,510
have around them and increasingly those

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,150
are going to be pcs that are expressed

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,270
as you know tiny devices that live

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:05,220
around your body somehow to me it's

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,910
really important that we we put free

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,930
software in play right at the cutting

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,580
edge of that story there will be many

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,930
sessions this week on that I'm not going

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,000
to try and cover everything that's

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,130
that's going to be done there but I feel

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,980
like that damn is about to burst in our

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,620
favor right we've we've done all the

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,500
preparatory work I think the results now

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,510
are super credible super clear and I'm

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,130
very proud to have been part of that

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,890
process and delighted with the teams

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:40,100
that are taking ownership of that and

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:42,900
running with it and we're also seeing

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,540
innovation in a whole new category of

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,990
computing right traditionally there's

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:53,430
being servers and desktops we now call a

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,080
cloud and personal computing servers are

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,840
getting reinvented as cloud personal

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,510
computing is getting reinvent reinvented

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,270
around convergence but there's also this

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,210
new category of computing which is

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,160
things and things are kind of

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,910
interesting because they are neither

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,250
personal nor centralized so if you

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,650
imagine the data center it's very

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,590
impersonal right it's not a it's not a

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,780
social place to be none of those

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,350
machines specifically belong to anybody

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,820
they kind of belong to the cloud and but

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,540
there's a lot of professional attention

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,730
on that data center to make

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,980
sure that those servers are doing what

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,530
they should be doing and similarly if

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,330
you imagine personal computing it's a

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,130
very personal right for pretty much any

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,280
personal device you can associate that

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,590
with a person or at least a family and

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,570
say well that's the that's the person

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,910
who's responsible for making decisions

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,840
about that device but when we talk about

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:55,780
the Internet of Things and we have

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,670
neither a very strong personal story nor

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,450
a very strong kind of centralized

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,400
consolidated professional story right so

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,110
we have all of these things emerging

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,400
around us that are smart that have

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:11,950
software that are vulnerable to security

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,330
flaws just like any software is but

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,100
where it's much more difficult to know

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,870
exactly who's responsible for fixing

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,250
anything and how they going to do that

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,290
and and how they going to do that

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,950
professionally so for us that's an

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,490
entirely new domain for free software

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,140
and I'm super excited about how we are

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,960
now making it possible for people to

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,800
innovate in that space on top of ubuntu

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,060
as they as they generally do innovate

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,920
but also to do it in such a way that

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,900
when we have millions of those things

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,240
out in the world it will be secure it

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,550
will be secured by default in a way that

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,200
it wouldn't be if we just did a bun to

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,320
their the way we've done a bun to

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:55,120
everywhere else so that of course is the

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,630
world of snappy Ubuntu call snaps snap

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,210
craft a whole new world a whole new kind

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,640
of set of tools and language but of

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,500
course all built around exactly the same

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,510
kernels exactly the same libraries

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,240
exactly the same updates exactly the

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,960
same free software that makes up a bun

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:18,190
to today just this week the world's

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,890
biggest manufacturer of drones like this

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,710
like this quadcopter and released a

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,470
control system and open make a friendly

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,960
control system called a manifold which

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:32,260
is what I'm showing here and and that

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,970
control system is run 02 it's completely

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,380
open you can you can do everything that

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,450
you would imagine doing with a little

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,360
ability server you can write software

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:44,679
that will fly around and do stuff

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,570
that's incredibly cool so I'm very proud

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,490
to be underwriting supporting our work

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,230
there I think the teams involved again

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,200
have done something incredible with

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,940
snappy and with wood to call and for

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,170
those of you who are diving into it I

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,500
think you're going to find it's an easy

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:02,650
way to make brilliant things right think

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,770
of ubuntu core as like ubuntu firmware

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,690
right it's not about to server the way

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,720
you used to it but it's much more crisp

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,880
much more structured much more suitable

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,679
for rapid updates of distributed systems

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,020
I've never seen us do anything that took

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,549
off as quickly as snappy right it's it

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,410
seems like everywhere in the world there

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,970
are people who just desperate to figure

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,299
out how they can have devices in the

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,700
field that get transactional updates and

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:34,390
snappy does all of that six months ago

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,740
at the start of 1510 I I talked through

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,530
this but I'd like to do it again right I

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,049
want to show you the difference between

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:43,240
classic Ubuntu and snappy but so in

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:46,059
classical into you have a big file

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,890
system and that file system is is read

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,169
right right and every time you have to

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,850
get a package that package can write

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:55,600
anywhere in the file system it can write

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:59,740
to / etc it can write too far live

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,419
anything and essentially it it it does

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,059
whatever it needs to do to integrate

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,950
that package into the existing system

00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,360
and that's really cool it's it's a good

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,340
way to kind of get a bunch of software

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,470
together in one system but it causes

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,650
these overlaps causes these problems

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,870
where after a while we need an expert or

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,090
a management system to tease apart all

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,400
the changes on the file system and deal

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,950
with things like upgrades so that's why

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,100
we made snappy able to now it snappy

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,890
able to we separate all the pieces so we

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,720
have a giant blob which is the OS snap

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,520
and we have a separate snap for the

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,950
colonel and we keep those things

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,650
completely separate right we essentially

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,049
keep those things read-only so that OS

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,610
snap can't be tampered with right you

00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:46,480
can check a digital signature on that

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,340
and see if anybody has modified any bits

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,909
in it which is hugely important in a

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,639
world

00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,619
it turns out there's a lot of sneaky

00:22:51,639 --> 00:23:00,190
stuff going on behind the scenes with

00:22:53,619 --> 00:23:03,159
with hacking and surveillance of the

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:07,840
systems that we all count on so we have

00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,909
these signed blobs effectively which

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,859
allow us to get transactional updates of

00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:14,409
the kernel and transactional updates of

00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:17,349
the OS each of those has some writable

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:19,330
space and then we add apps as an

00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:21,820
additional collection of those same

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,220
signed blobs and each of them get their

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,929
own writable area because we keep those

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,749
things completely separate we can update

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,549
them much more easily because we don't

00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:33,129
have to we don't have to figure out the

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,440
interlock between these different parts

00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:37,570
each of these parts can only write to

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,179
the space that is that is assigned to it

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,009
so this is what a snappy or go to system

00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,570
looks like the file system essentially

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:45,399
is built in a completely different way

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,889
even though the binaries and the

00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:51,340
libraries are exactly the same as the

00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:53,979
stuff that you're familiar with so snap

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,919
craft is a tool to help you build snaps

00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:59,499
and it's kind of like apt-get for source

00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,929
code on github and it's a lot of fun

00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:04,090
right what we've noticed is that the

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:06,639
world of free software development is

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,889
now moving much faster than the

00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:11,559
traditional packaging process can

00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:15,369
accommodate and so in a weird kind of

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:18,399
way we needed a new way to enable people

00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:20,440
to share stuff and that's much faster

00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:23,200
than traditional packing and that's what

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,269
snaps really are snap craft is the new

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,059
tool to help you build those it's a

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:30,190
packaging tool effectively it makes it

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,109
much easier to assemble a snap out of a

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,580
bunch of reusable parts which are

00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:35,859
essentially like source code build

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,639
recipes it reuses all the existing

00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:42,249
upstream build systems so auto tools and

00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:45,269
the existing packaging systems for

00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:49,090
things like Python packages pipe pipe I

00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:51,690
and the equivalent things for know Jas

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,849
or Ruby for example are all supported by

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,429
snap craft so it's really fun really

00:24:54,849 --> 00:25:00,169
easy to make snaps really easy to share

00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,929
essentially recipes for how you build

00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:08,389
the very latest source code into a snap

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:09,919
to distribute any snappy system these

00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:12,950
are the kinds of devices that we see

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,350
people making smart TVs Reuters gateways

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,749
and in the last six months we've seen a

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,299
big put a big surge in the number of

00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:23,029
people building snappy systems in

00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,249
particular Wi-Fi networking equipment

00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:27,739
and switching network equipment we've

00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:30,289
seen people using snappy in those

00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:32,720
environments robots all of the

00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:35,029
open-source robots seem to be running a

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,639
bun too and snappy makes it very easy

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,100
for people to make smart robots that

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:42,590
that enable essentially apps to be

00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,679
installed and to do that all safely and

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:50,239
securely and reliably and of course

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:53,029
drones like like that DJ I make a

00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:54,379
friendly drug there's a lot of cool

00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:56,869
stuff happening if you're interested in

00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:58,429
any of those areas then snappy is a very

00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:01,070
cool thing to check out and I would

00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:04,759
encourage you to enjoy and to join and

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:08,299
enjoy the sessions this week on snappy

00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:10,970
snap crafts and those very cool internet

00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:15,019
of toys Internet of Things and type

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:18,799
initiatives from there i'd like to take

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:23,109
us to the cloud and we learned last week

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:26,359
at the OpenStack summit on in Tokyo that

00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:30,019
sixty-five percent of the large open

00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:32,179
sneck deployments clouds are on a bunt

00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:34,789
and that's because we've taken a very

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,529
open very collaborative approach to the

00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:38,570
packaging of OpenStack on Ubuntu

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,730
enabling people to build those clouds

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,539
very quickly and very easily you might

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,989
have seen a new package landing in my li

00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:50,419
which is a an OpenStack installer making

00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:53,269
it really easy for people to deploy

00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,799
OpenStack which is a complicated big big

00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,289
piece of software that's essentially

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,710
giving you a nice clean wizard to walk

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:04,309
through and deploy OpenStack on a single

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,899
machine or on 500 machines and from

00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,480
there essentially you can imagine us

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:10,550
broadening to look at all of the big

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,340
distributed software that is kind of

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:15,800
over the cloud by which I mean big data

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,400
things like Hadoop and spark and machine

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,530
learning tools but also the new

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,650
container systems like me Zeus and

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:28,010
flocker and project Orca from Dhaka and

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:30,800
these are all rich complicated

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,680
fast-moving large-scale pieces of

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,930
software and juju really makes it easy

00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,510
for people to work with those in the

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,310
same way that apt makes it easy to work

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,470
with a single machine juju makes it

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,140
really easy to work with clusters of

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,600
machines on the cloud or physical

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:53,410
machines so this is this is Hadoop hive

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,110
using juju this is a darker deployment

00:27:53,410 --> 00:28:00,520
with a TD and and flannel this is open

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:03,380
stack itself muddled in juju right so

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,450
good to has always been about trying to

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,580
take the most interesting and complex

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,440
stuff and make it really easy so that

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,020
lots of people can innovate around it if

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,190
we make the complex stuff easy then the

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,620
next wave of innovation come as much

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,590
faster and juju is really our way of

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,870
bringing that up unto Zen too complex

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,970
distributed systems so there'll be a

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,820
bunch of sessions on charming how you

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,670
write charms of software so that they

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,190
can be spun up at scale like all of the

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:37,060
software that I'm showing you here this

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,650
is Cuban eighties the Google led

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,570
container orchestration and management

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,750
system docker container orchestration

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,810
and management system charming just got

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,130
a whole lot more fun and because we've

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,920
built some tools that enable you to

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,780
reuse other people's charm components

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,040
essentially so if you're writing a charm

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,410
that just needs to plug into some

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,390
standard parts then it gets a lot easier

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,520
you don't have to write all this code

00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,940
yourself this is what a charm looks like

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,200
but you can essentially just use and

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,000
standard templates and hook into

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,430
standard events in any language to make

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,810
your your chart so join the sessions

00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,780
look at look at the stuff around

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:20,330
interface stubs and standard charm

00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,400
layers and charming got a whole lot

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,820
easier and it's

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,920
it's a bunch of fun we've also done some

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,480
work to integrate the world of darker

00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,280
within the with the world of charms

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,380
docker is very popular as a way to kind

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,170
of ship a binary but it's kind of hard

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,870
to make that binary easily integrated

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:40,120
into into other people's worlds so if

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,730
you wrap a charm around the docker image

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,440
it gets much more responsive much more

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,790
useful much easier for people to deploy

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,290
on a bunch of different clouds without

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,000
having to think about what it you know

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,060
everything that's going on inside that

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,890
deployment and so we call that payload

00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,470
management doctor is one of the kinds of

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,200
payloads the chance can use alongside

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,610
the kvm instance instances and so on we

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,040
found that that really helps people who

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,380
are charming stuff which is either

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:10,030
available as a virtual machine or

00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:12,040
available as as a docker image a huge

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,980
step forward for us in the doojoo world

00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,370
was came in the latest version of juju

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,890
125 where charms got the ability to talk

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,290
about the network and storage as

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,670
first-class things so your child can now

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,470
say look I've got a bunch of different

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,800
things that I want to expose in

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,200
different parts of the network or I can

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,900
i can use several different classes of

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,950
storage to optimize both the economics

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,290
and the performance of of the app that's

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,090
being deployed on the cloud so for

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,120
people who are doing really complex

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:49,840
things which which need to be across

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:53,560
multiple kind of zones in the network or

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,270
where you've got applications that could

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,850
use different classes of storage in the

00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,580
cloud faster storage slow storage cheap

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,170
storage expensive storage and you know

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,560
and tune things to use the right kind of

00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,640
storage for the right purpose and

00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,870
charming just got a whole lot more fun

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,660
and a lot more useful and lastly we've

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:16,210
we've made it really easy now for chance

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,160
to tell you what's going on to signal

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,770
what they're doing what they're waiting

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,300
for which makes the whole thing much

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,530
much more usable if you're deploying a

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,990
big complex thing you can now see

00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,510
exactly what's going across all of that

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,130
complexity and it just makes working

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,440
with big distributed systems really

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,880
quite fun for me it's been a lot of fun

00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,890
to see people who've been struggling

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,560
openstack or struggling with big data

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,390
suddenly realize that actually it can be

00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,520
super easy it reminds me a lot of the

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,250
early days of ubuntu where you know the

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,710
linux is hard turns into turns into you

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,720
know why ashley linux can be for human

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,280
beings right so now we're trying to say

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,260
look there's these big distributed

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,640
systems they can also be free human

00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,350
beings and we can share and collaborate

00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,850
and and and democratize effectively that

00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,460
complexity so that you don't have to be

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:08,110
a big organization to work with amazing

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,400
stuff like machine learning okay um

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,940
switching tack you'll see some sessions

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,360
this week about something called XD lxd

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,660
is pure container hypervisor so it is in

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,910
a very real sense the world's fastest

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,250
hypervisor for those of you who are

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,510
working with lots of machines lots of

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:32,840
systems linux on servers linux at scale

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:36,530
Lex d is like kvm that much much lighter

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,660
much much faster and it is not yet

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,820
something that we would recommend for a

00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,060
public cloud but for private clouds XD

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,590
is pretty amazing and I it's a lot of

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,690
fun to be able to sit with your laptop

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,210
and spin up 50 machines just on your

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,210
laptop with centos and debian and ubuntu

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,560
and red hat and Souza all kind of you

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,560
know doing whatever you want in them it

00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,000
makes plain with Linux a lot of fun

00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,890
especially if you're coming from a a

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,650
server background and you're interested

00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:06,290
in distributed systems making it easy

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:09,350
for developers to to work on distributed

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,970
systems is a key goal for us and the

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,760
easier we can make it for developers to

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,440
invent the faster they'll invent amazing

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,540
things and I think Lex d is going to be

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,630
a key part of that I would encourage you

00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:24,080
to dive in and play with it now XD is

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:26,420
now available in the various backports

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,750
repositories and in wylie and of course

00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:35,420
in ins email in 1604 as well as a as a

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:37,340
two-pointer be 21 and sticking with the

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,440
server story for those of you who are

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,060
doing a good to and scale and the bunt

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,270
who is now the platform of choice for

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,040
people who are doing Linux at scale and

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,740
we have where we're going to include

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,140
mass 2 point 0 e

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,120
12 1604 for those of you who've been

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,130
following mares I hope you'll agree it's

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,170
become an incredible tool right you can

00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,030
do through the web managing racks of

00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,100
servers you can do network bonding you

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,809
can do raid of the disks you can set up

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,700
everything exactly the way you want it

00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:07,090
and then you can deploy stuff in this

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,679
totally automated way it's amazing magic

00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,879
it's being used in some amazing places

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,169
right to do very large very cool

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,030
deployments underneath big data

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:18,700
underneath clouds underneath machine

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,379
learning underneath windows and rel and

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:24,460
Andy Souza and Ernie debian underneath

00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:27,040
12 and and I hope that you'll you'll

00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,960
find it a lot of fun it is also pretty

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,550
cool to run at home you know if you just

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,159
have if you have a network and you wanna

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,500
have a dns server you can use mass and

00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,649
it gives you a nice dns server GUI

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,879
effectively for all the stuff at at home

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:42,250
and if you want to do quick deploys

00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,139
quick installs of server type stuff then

00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,540
it's a great way to do it so if you have

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:48,460
a little Intel look and you want to use

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,359
that for testing server stuff then

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,429
masses is pretty cool so it is going to

00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:57,100
be a great week and I think it's going

00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:59,859
to be an amazing release you know it

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,250
feels like a long time since 1404 it's

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:05,619
only been 18 months but a huge amount

00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,810
has gotten done I just touched the

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:13,480
surface and provided and I hope your

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:15,190
useful overview of of all of that this

00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,050
is the cycle where we bring all of that

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,970
cool stuff together to make it a release

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,180
that people will use for you know for

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,619
many years if you have things that you

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,900
want to integrate in this is the week to

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,400
climb in if you have ideas for how we

00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,100
make it awesome this is the week to

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,780
climb in please don't hesitate to speak

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:37,390
up right it is it is much easier to get

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,960
ideas in now in the cycle than it is the

00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:43,540
week before release so so so have at it

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,430
have fun and thank you to all of the

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,140
organizers and the session moderators

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,540
and the leaders of the various of the

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,960
various areas I also want to say thank

00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,660
you to our community council we have I

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,580
think we've had the best community

00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,330
council we've ever had you know this is

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,340
a

00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,280
this is a team that cares deeply about

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,580
all aspects of ubuntu and balancing the

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,410
many conflicting interests in

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,900
essentially the world's biggest

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,090
collaborative project and they've done

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,750
an incredible job in particular I want

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,940
to celebrate that this team stayed focus

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,070
on helping teams be productive and

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,800
collaborate and get what they wanted to

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:25,980
get done at a time when you know they

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:31,960
were they were in the middle of a lot of

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,820
sledging and and and intention at the

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,190
end of the day I think we come together

00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,170
because we want to get stuff done and if

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,000
you're successful you attract people who

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,130
have other agendas as well we shouldn't

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,870
stress about that right it's important

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,210
for us to help the people who

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,100
constructively engage get as much done

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,070
as they possibly can't possibly want to

00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:54,490
people build amazing stuff on on a bun

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:56,830
to derivatives flavors cool projects

00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,510
even some of our biggest critics use

00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,460
ubuntu for the stuff that they care most

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,350
about and i love that right i think i

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,840
think that's that's part of what makes a

00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:09,040
blow to special and and we couldn't do

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:12,510
that without an independent and caring

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,160
community council to those guys who've

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,650
led the community who've been the face

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,220
of the community in a bid to thank you

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:25,420
very much I'm delighted that we've had

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:27,880
superb nominations for the next round of

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,910
elections to the community council and

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,390
we will publish a shortlist of

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:37,600
candidates for everybody to to step up

00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:42,940
and select your community council for

00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,770
the period going forward so thank you to

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,120
the outgoing community council thank you

00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,130
very much to those who are stepping up

00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:53,650
to to serve on that very important body

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:57,040
going forward and thank you to all of

00:37:53,650 --> 00:38:02,260
you for for making this an awesome

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:05,650
online summit and a great release so it

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,950
is the Z niall zeros zinio is like

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,050
genial with a whole lot more x and z

00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,540
meal is

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:16,500
love you words expressing friendship

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,570
expressing hospitality expressing you

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,400
know an inviting household a place that

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,340
everybody wants to come together have

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,080
fun and get stuff done so kind of

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,300
delighted that things came together that

00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:34,370
that we could use it as the code word

00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:40,830
for 1604 LTS I'm super excited I hope

00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:42,360
you are all super excited it is going to

00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,950
be an amazing release you know if I look

00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,050
at the ground work that's gone into it

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,270
if I look at how well things have come

00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,640
together broadly in the kernel community

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,730
they're interested in in an LTS release

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,280
that is perfectly time for for Xenia so

00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,470
I think it's going to be a release you

00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,600
know to remember something that will

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,420
take a bun 22 whole new audiences

00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,410
through convergence through XD through

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:11,130
juju through snappy I think you and your

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:12,630
friends and your and your colleagues are

00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,210
going to build incredible things on it

00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:19,410
so let's make sure we build it really

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:21,360
well right David I'm sure we have time

00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:26,430
for questions and I'd love to take some

00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:28,770
and yes we do them so folks have been

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,300
really sad it during the keynote and

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,790
we've got a serious questions already

00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,720
lineman so I'm just gonna pick some of

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,950
them from the list um look at about 20

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,250
minutes I know that some of you have

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:43,430
multiple questions in order to ease the

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,260
opportunity to everyone to ask am I just

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:48,440
pick from different questions from

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,560
different presentations in any case

00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,600
first questioning is formed which way

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm gonna summarize it is an extremely

00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:01,260
long question it goes like looking back

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,230
at the 2013 spellman video where I want

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,660
was referred us spyware by richard

00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,190
stallman simply because you have to turn

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,700
off the shopping lines option in the

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,680
settings and my question is would mark

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,290
what do you think about about that and

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,800
what do you feel about our ms his views

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,480
in general concerning Oval tool well of

00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,109
course I love Richard right i mean he

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,999
saw

00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:29,549
firm sort of amazing he's also sort of

00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:30,630
cranky and and i'm pretty sure that none

00:40:29,549 --> 00:40:34,140
of us would agree with him on everything

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,749
right and so so i'm not lost all

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,759
offended that he would express his views

00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:42,029
strongly and clearly i'm also not at all

00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:44,609
offended that we we tried that avenue to

00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:47,549
kind of connect people to what they do

00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,769
at the end of the day personal computing

00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:53,519
is about connecting you to the world and

00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:55,970
it's got to be useful we've got to think

00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,160
about what will make a bunch of useful

00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,989
that is a changing story right like the

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,910
way we use personal computing is

00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:04,950
different today than it was 11 years ago

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,660
when we when we created about to write

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,489
or when we first released upon to and

00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,660
we're not going to get it right every

00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:14,249
time like we just thought but you you've

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,259
got to be bold and you've gotta take

00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:18,900
risks and you've got to essentially you

00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:20,279
know explore territory that that other

00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,619
people haven't explored yet otherwise

00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:24,210
you're kind of consigned to an also-ran

00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,109
where your consigned to following

00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:30,329
following others right and Ubuntu is a

00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:33,390
place where we do take some risks right

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:35,059
where we are adventurous and usually we

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:39,119
get it absolutely right you know

00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:40,589
convergence was a you know was something

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,720
nobody believed and yet now suddenly

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,269
everybody's doing it and we kind of

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,660
build that for free software right we we

00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:50,700
couldn't put free software at the front

00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:54,450
if we weren't willing to take risks and

00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,789
occasionally be wrong and I think the

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,210
term spyware was totally prejudicial and

00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:02,309
completely uncalled for and you know

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,650
deliberately you know clickbait

00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:08,460
controversial right but that's Richard I

00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:12,359
think our execution of the idea wasn't

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,400
great and so you know we missed on that

00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,869
and there are other cases like that you

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,170
know i think when we introduced unity

00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:22,349
seven and we moved it to the default too

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:25,200
fast and that's okay we learn the stuff

00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,999
right it doesn't bug me at all that

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,299
we've learned things along the way and

00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:32,579
it would bug me if we were kind of

00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:34,079
afraid to ever be controversial because

00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,050
then we would never do anything

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,150
interesting

00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:40,150
right everything the Eiffel Tower was

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:45,060
controversial right and and now it's an

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:47,200
icon so um thank you for the question

00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,830
thank you Richard for speaking your mind

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,930
don't ever give up and I also hope that

00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,150
nobody at the Ubuntu online summit is

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,400
going to be afraid to grab hold of the

00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:02,860
future and build it even if it might be

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:07,960
a little controversial right our next

00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:09,760
question is going from VT meeting are

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,330
there any news on whether what's up will

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,790
arrive to what you want to fall or not

00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:19,690
la I can't make a prediction in that

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:21,100
regard and it might happen there's

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,690
there's good reasons why it would happen

00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,990
and there's also reasons why it might

00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,000
not happen I think we will likely get

00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,010
some interesting apps on the phone

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,760
especially we tell a convergent story

00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,830
well I think we will certainly be able

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,380
to tell a better story about security

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:41,050
and connectivity and convergence than

00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:46,030
anybody else in the world and that's

00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:47,950
enough for me enabling developers to

00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,630
have a highly secure device that has the

00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,060
best of free software in their pocket

00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,260
and can be a full PC experience with

00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,290
them to that up and do other amazing

00:43:53,260 --> 00:44:00,310
things that's a pretty awesome goal and

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:03,490
I'm willing to I'm willing to kind of be

00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:07,480
part of that just for that right I also

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:09,940
think that and with snappy we are going

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,430
to be the default operating system for

00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:17,020
huge classes of devices really important

00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:20,980
devices robots cause aeroplanes drones

00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:24,250
and switches Reuters stuff that runs the

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,650
internet and runs a really important

00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:30,160
infrastructure for you personally right

00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:32,800
at home at the office and and and that's

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,180
the same app ecosystem that we have for

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,840
the phone right it's going to be one

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,740
blood one sort of coherent app ecosystem

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,660
so I think there's going to be a ton of

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,860
innovation there I think we should dive

00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,860
in and see what we can create

00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,260
alright then planning with the topic

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,250
educators asking are there any plans for

00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,589
element of home with her it's a super

00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,390
cool idea and obviously with snappy you

00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,339
could do in a bun 202 I think it'd be

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:05,420
pretty cool to try and make a snap of

00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:08,119
open wrt right and you could make you

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,130
could make the code of open wrt a lot

00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,050
more maintainable if it was a snap

00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:16,609
because you be able to reuse a lot of

00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:19,490
the core platform stuff from ubuntu be

00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:21,440
able to use many more kernels many more

00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:24,920
devices support many more devices much

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,059
more easily and and the wrt guys could

00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,119
focus on the stuff that's really

00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:32,119
important for them which is that network

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,250
management experience and so I took

00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,369
encourage someone to have a go at that

00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:39,200
it would be fun for me to install and

00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,430
snappy on on a home brewer and I guess

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,369
there would be a bunch of other people

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:48,140
who feel the same way all right make

00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:50,329
that hands and I can make them handed

00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,890
asking I happy with the piece of a

00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:56,869
window for hardware development

00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:59,299
worldwide well to me it's kind of

00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:01,130
amazing that you know real manufacturers

00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:03,319
keep stepping up and saying can we put

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,540
can we put up 12 on this on this new

00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:07,490
device of ours and we do you know

00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,510
constantly see people's coming forward

00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,270
and saying let's tell you about our

00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,780
roadmap and let's find a place for it 12

00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,700
and I think it's important that we

00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,290
carefully shape the emergence of a boom

00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,809
tube so that it goes to people who are

00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:23,510
going to love it and and contribute to

00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:25,430
it and be part of their ecosystem I

00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,190
think it would be a mistake for us to

00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,569
try to go too fast because if we put it

00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,579
in the hands of people who don't care

00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:33,349
about it 12 and don't want to be part of

00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,240
it right now I think they'd be

00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:37,369
disappointed and we'd be disappointed

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,440
and a lot of thing with EMS but I think

00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:42,020
that that the the steady growth of that

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,960
is is clear I think the convergence

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,910
story is a big step forward for us and I

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,559
think having devices that really tell

00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:51,380
that convergence story is the next big

00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,299
step and so you know that's a real focus

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,280
for the team for 16 or four to be able

00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:57,080
to show a

00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,590
a phone in your pocket which can give

00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,060
you a PC experience and I think we're

00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,170
going to be doing it just as soon as

00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:11,240
some of the biggest companies in the

00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:16,430
world all right sorry i was busy feeding

00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,680
the questions from our audience next

00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:22,280
question from Lucas said window

00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:28,490
conversions mere / Wayland's containers

00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:32,150
is that for 12 1604 or later they will

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,710
be convergence in a bunch of 1604 in

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:39,290
other words that you will be able to

00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:41,630
build a son that is also a pc with the

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,190
versions of unity 8 that go into 1604

00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,350
you can already do it you would have

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:48,530
seen blogs people showing their their

00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:50,570
production fun with aspects of

00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,980
convergence obviously there's a bunch of

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,870
stuff we'd like to get we'd like to get

00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,960
some of the you know traditional kind of

00:47:53,870 --> 00:48:00,620
legacy linux applications things like

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,750
open office working really nicely in

00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,090
that convergence things so that you and

00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,820
I can can actually use it as our daily

00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,250
driver I'd like to have my laptop run in

00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:13,640
unity 8 and be a snappy system rather

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,830
than a sort of classic dead based system

00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,340
and so those are the things we're trying

00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:20,660
to get right for 1604 we know that you

00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,000
know that new world isn't going to be

00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,890
ready to be the default so we won't make

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,420
it the default but we'll make it an

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,340
option for people and it'll be a fun

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:34,550
option for for those of us who like to

00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:39,400
kind of push the limits and um I hope

00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:42,500
that answers your question all right um

00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,880
yeah Nizar king aside from conversions

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,670
what are some of the key differentiators

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,260
between point one points and the

00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:54,020
competition for your average consumer

00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:56,150
now I think a security story for a boon

00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,590
to our phones is really good I think I'm

00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,930
proud of the fact that we picked

00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,480
telegram and that telegram is becoming

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,630
kind of the key messaging app for people

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,970
who care about privacy and I think our

00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:11,070
update story is in a world class you

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:13,260
I have you know a much less fragmented

00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:16,880
ecosystem with ubuntu than you do with

00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,560
other kind of open phone platforms and

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,680
and I'm super proud of the design right

00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,450
it was very difficult when we hired some

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,099
the best designers in the world they

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,859
some of them said it was impossible to

00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,180
do a convergent experience right and I

00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:32,010
look at what we've got and I think it's

00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:35,790
really clean really thoughtful really

00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,900
beautiful and will scale nicely so so I

00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:46,770
think those are all things to be proud

00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:50,130
of to celebrate and and to invest it all

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:51,930
right math quiz Nathan paint is asking

00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,760
will want a personal email on the

00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:57,960
desktop to experience on a device like

00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:04,970
like raspberry p model too that's

00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:08,369
interesting yes I think it will um but

00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:10,020
the it's much more interesting to

00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,480
actually have it on a phone because then

00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,820
you get the experience of of having it

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,460
on a phone right of it being fun I think

00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,030
a rise bring kinds in the user is a

00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,250
small pc so yes it should work but then

00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,900
it's not really convergence because you

00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,119
don't really have those other pieces I

00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,970
think the fun stuff for us in the cycle

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,500
is obviously getting access to some of

00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,550
those traditional applications as a

00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,220
legacy applications from the from the

00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:42,180
traditional X Windows Linux world like

00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:43,710
Open Office the cool you know cool

00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,720
stuff like that let's show how that can

00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,000
come to the phone come to the tablet I

00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,400
think also we have a lot of work to do

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,750
in the tablet form factor right you've

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,940
seen how the phone has really come

00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,010
together it's a much cleaner classier

00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,740
experience now than when we put out the

00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:00,630
one point oh the the next step is

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,150
obviously the tablet form factor with

00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:05,400
our side stage and multitasking story

00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,710
and it's kind of amazing to me that we

00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,260
put multitasking in the side stage and

00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,900
just just this week I've got an update

00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,180
from from apple on an iOS device and

00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,180
there's a side stage right so I think

00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,830
you for many people it's a real

00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,580
privilege to be part of a free software

00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,350
project

00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,630
is right at the front at the forefront

00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:26,970
you know not copying the proprietary

00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:29,010
guys five years later but actually right

00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,570
there at the time that it's happening so

00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,640
for those of you who like to kind of be

00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:36,270
part of the next thing that's that's a

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,950
great opportunity all right so I'm gonna

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,870
take a question that's related to the

00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,210
gavotte already answered part of it but

00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,190
just crackers into asking aren't you

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:53,880
scared Microsoft will still want to

00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:55,860
stand there with continuum no think of

00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,850
how many ideas other people have had

00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:03,300
that make up 12 grade isn't that it's

00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:05,130
obvious right and had we couldn't it

00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,350
wouldn't it wouldn't work if we thought

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,090
that they might be upset that we you

00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,640
know use their ideas think of how many

00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:14,340
brilliant people contributed to linux

00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,990
contributed to all the various desktop

00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,910
environments and how many of those ideas

00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,380
landed on community we've had our fair

00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:24,510
share of brilliant ideas and I think

00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,260
it's great for others to be following

00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:30,360
right i saw i saw a microsoft you know

00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,890
announcement about an LTS product and

00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,390
that made me laugh a little bit i

00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,580
thought that was kind of cool right that

00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,650
we've had ideas about how software

00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,540
should be delivered to people as well as

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:41,910
the experience and so on that that are

00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:45,900
spreading to media revolution isn't

00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:48,060
about burning down the palace right and

00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,820
it isn't about killing people in the

00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,740
palace it's about getting everybody to

00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:56,010
think about the world in a new way

00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,660
that's a real revolution and it would be

00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,880
difficult for us to claim to have

00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,650
conducted a successful revolution right

00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,590
if all we ended up with was the smoking

00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,940
ruin of the palace right and what we

00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,500
really want to do is to be able to say

00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,060
look we were part of getting the whole

00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,510
software industry to think differently

00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:14,580
about software and to me that's a classy

00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:20,180
revolution and that's how I like us to

00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:23,790
be okay we've got about five minutes

00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:26,250
left so if you've got any last minute

00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:29,370
questions just prepare them and I will

00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,110
try to learn as many as we can Mary

00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,410
repeat asking what is a woman to touch

00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:35,660
strategy to fix the you

00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:39,860
turn it up and absolutely to users

00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,810
problem ah well the first thing is you

00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,000
know let's be useful to the biggest

00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:46,790
biggest possible crowd of users right

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,680
and for us right now that is the Linux

00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,570
desktop audience right to develop a

00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,670
desktop we have a fantastic developer

00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:55,460
desktop if you walk into the offices of

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:57,500
most large-scale engineering operations

00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,690
you see a lot of ubuntu right we have a

00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,400
fantastic develop the desktop let's

00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:03,440
let's take that converge convergence

00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:08,660
story and bring it up right let's make

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,130
people want to use a converged desktop

00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,500
on a limb to be right because that way

00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:15,050
they can they can develop everywhere

00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,790
they can they can carry things around in

00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:20,090
a whole new way so that's that's a key

00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:21,980
categories the second thing is you have

00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,620
to be there at the point of disruption

00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,290
and to be honest we're kind of nine

00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,990
years late on the phone right because

00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:31,970
the point of disruption was seven years

00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:34,010
ago to be part of that we would needed

00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,720
to start of two years before that so I

00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,700
don't mind being Mannion's late because

00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:41,120
we're also right at the beginning of

00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,710
convergence right so we missed the only

00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:46,040
phone that we've built a convergent

00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:48,500
story that i think is first class and a

00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,030
leading convergent story and then the

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,110
last thing is to remember that personal

00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:54,200
computing is going to get disrupted

00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:56,180
again right personal computing is going

00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,550
to get disrupted again so it's important

00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,660
for us to be there when that happens and

00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,820
then we can be part of the next

00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:08,210
disruption and who knows how that might

00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:11,060
play out all right next question comes

00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:16,100
from young we will see a refresh icon

00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:17,990
theme for 1604 and DVD 7 and well

00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:20,120
there's a great deal of work that's been

00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:22,370
done on icons that's showing up as part

00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,470
of the fun part of the convergence story

00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,630
and I think it's completely plausible to

00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:31,550
bring that to unity 7 that's a great

00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:33,560
thing to discuss this week all right so

00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:36,920
next question from Agra will wish it a

00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:40,670
Lexi and Alexia by default everywhere in

00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,410
1604 yes we will so and if you haven't

00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,100
played with lexi would specifically Lex

00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,520
d which is Lex Lex ce 2.0 include

00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,980
XD it's amazing it's incredible it will

00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,810
change the way you develop because you

00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,030
can now super quickly just create a

00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,950
fresh container which is a like a fresh

00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,480
space and you can do all of your

00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,930
building in there and it doesn't taint

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:05,500
your existing environment so it's really

00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:08,860
a complete transformation of the way you

00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,630
use the Linux machine so yes legs d will

00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,460
be a standard part of a bun to be there

00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,930
on every machine you can you can you can

00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,660
you know launch a container with a

00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:20,560
single command and it's it's going to be

00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:22,540
awesome all right and something we're

00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:26,140
going to take the last question so that

00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:29,050
we can start sessions on time clr is

00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,790
asking how long before how long will

00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,950
pour we will see a functional desktop

00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:36,700
aunt Natalie we call the basic desktop

00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:39,640
apps that's a great question for the for

00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,050
the desktop desktop team now they've

00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,640
done some pretty amazing things you've

00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,460
probably seen blogs and videos right

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,490
they've got traditional X applications

00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,110
working in a snappy world and this

00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,420
there's probably a bunch more stuff that

00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:54,190
we need to do but with snap crafts it

00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,660
should be really easy for us to bring

00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:59,020
some of those some of those packages

00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,820
into thats now eat world and it's a fun

00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,770
place to contribute it's a fun place to

00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,530
be and there's as much interesting

00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:07,300
hacking to be done I would I really want

00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:09,090
my laptop to be a snappy machine right

00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,710
it's a much more secure way to work and

00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:14,230
I'm sure initially there'll be a ton of

00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:16,510
sharp edges but you know I work my way

00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:18,370
around quite a few sharp edges in in

00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,990
life and I find that if you're willing

00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,500
to do that you get a taste of the future

00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:25,990
much you know much before everybody else

00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,360
