all right we should be on air now if

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,059
someone on IR so you can let us know

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,059
when you can see us welcome to marks

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,099
keynote and QA session if you have any

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,839
questions during this feel free to put

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,789
them in IRC start them with the word

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,730
question and all caps and I'll get a

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,990
nice highlighted list of them that we

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,460
can go through once he's done with this

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,460
presentation all right you share that

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,940
all right we should be good be good all

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,070
right we're off to the races hello

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,149
everybody it's great to speak with you

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,610
again I'm looking forward to your

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,829
questions and I wanted to take a little

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,420
bit of time just to walk through the and

00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,030
two big thrusts of ubuntu as i see it at

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,180
the moment and so starting on the

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,670
desktop on the client side and at the

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,950
moment we're in a really interesting

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,010
time of dynamism in the linux desktop

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,630
world and i think i want to continues to

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,990
lead the way in terms of being an open

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,970
platform for the world's desktops and so

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,909
we can call that mean the support all

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,729
the desktops mean we have unity as I

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,420
default and it continues to show itself

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,659
to do very well in user testing and as a

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,079
desktop for people who want a crisp

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,750
clean functional understandable platform

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,850
and it's also the basis of our work for

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,560
convergence tried bringing and all of

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,430
the different personal computing fields

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,700
together and but we have I think very

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,649
strong communities driving other desktop

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,990
platforms and I was very pleased to see

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,320
that there's a resurgence in interest in

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,210
bringing cinnamon mate and various other

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,750
desktop environments two of them to as

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,610
first-class remixes as well I think it's

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,479
very healthy for us to offer that kind

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,179
of choice to to end users and all of

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,150
those develops desktops have things to

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,580
celebrate about them and I'd be very

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,530
glad to support

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,690
those projects and those initiatives I

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,460
want to give some big thanks and kudos

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,470
to everybody who pulled together for

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,220
1404 because I thought all of the

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,680
desktops were really well represented in

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,050
those in that release and all of those

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
communities really took the LTS mean to

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,459
heart you know so there was a lot of

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,990
collaboration around taking advantage of

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,300
the fact that in the base platform we

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,260
were doing an LTS to be able to offer

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,370
users of those desktop environments a

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,900
longer support commitment it was great

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,940
to see each of the different communities

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,700
stepping up and making their commitments

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,489
their respective commitments and for

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,709
1404 so thank you very much to to to all

00:02:53,489 --> 00:03:01,709
of them in terms of our focus with unity

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,480
and all of our energy now for unity

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,120
eight is focused on release to

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,310
manufacturers and we are focused on

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,890
providing a version two manufacturers

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,920
which they can ship we are showing the

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,980
first phones and in China in the coming

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,390
weeks so the very first sort of

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,519
prototypes that people can hold in their

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,940
hands and kick the tires on that's very

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,390
exciting for for us for the team and it

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,940
was great recently to have a spectrum of

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,130
community app developers participating

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,019
in one of our canonical Sprint's focused

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,510
on unity 8 and this this push to to

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,700
getting into market with an ax bunch of

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,500
phone I want to thank those developers

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,049
for coming along and for representing

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,900
the broader community and they brought

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,670
great energy and and I think they

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,079
enjoyed the process just judging from

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,610
blog posts and so on and that the app

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,130
design story has really come together

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,690
very beautifully so I think a key focus

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,370
for us in the community is to celebrate

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,900
app design you know with the Ubuntu

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,630
architecture we can do some unique

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,090
things in the applications and the more

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,590
we do that with our core applications

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,720
and the more we do that with community

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,549
contributed applications the stronger

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,500
the sense of having a great platform is

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,940
going to be and I think the choices that

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,280
we've made in terms of these of the

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,349
edges the design memes and so on are

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,610
holding together very very well as we

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:30,449
look at the phone the tablet

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,580
next the desktop so thank you very much

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,949
to those community members for coming

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,360
thank you also to the designers who i

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,009
think has done a really beautiful job of

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,590
pulling all of these different threads

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:43,080
together into a very coherent platform

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,789
story and to those of you who are

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,909
working on your applications I really

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,699
hope that you will celebrate that design

00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:53,819
both the design of your app but also the

00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:57,259
way it fits into the broader system so

00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:00,360
there's some great work to be done there

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:02,520
looking forward towards the desk to

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,800
towards desktop convergence again I

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,779
think all of the foundational pieces are

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,879
in place now I spend time with the

00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,800
design team looking through the window

00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,529
management transition how we bring

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,229
window management into unity eight and

00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:19,289
you know how we essentially extend the

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,250
tablet experience into the desktop and I

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,159
think that's come together really

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,810
beautifully if I was an app developer

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,919
you know there's an amazingly clean set

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,120
of primitives now for window management

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,180
immunity and I think that's going to be

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,370
really classy in its execution so lots

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,310
of really great opportunities there

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,020
interestingly some very major

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,669
manufacturers have started showing

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,669
devices that are built on a pontoon

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,919
using near and it's very interesting to

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,409
speculate how those would evolve over

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,479
time as we as we get to full convergence

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,699
full platform convergence in mirror

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,979
remember unity is just one shell using

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,779
mirror but all of the core primitives

00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,550
for window management and so on will be

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,830
there for anybody else who's building

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,409
their own shell and wants to do

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,599
interesting things there so the client

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,580
side of things is there is vibrant we we

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,139
are actively growing the number of

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,900
desktops that are supported in a bun too

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,529
we are actively pushing the envelope in

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:21,000
terms of sorts of devices that are

00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:23,639
supported in a bun to as well another

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,490
very interesting thread in those

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,939
conversations was taking the technology

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:33,210
that we use for the phone for system

00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,490
updates you know the system image update

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,399
mechanism and the technology that we use

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,470
for apps and uh paid app updates and

00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,950
bringing that to a wider classic

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,380
Isis and the entire sort of way large

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,450
organizations build large-scale

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,830
infrastructure is getting revisited and

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,410
we see a lot of interest in bringing a

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,290
pun to into things like switches and

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,850
Reuters Wi-Fi base stations and so on

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,500
and it turns out that a lot of the key

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,570
pieces that we've built for the phone

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,790
I'm going to be really interesting for

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,200
those other environments and devices as

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,820
well there's some incredible work

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,100
happening on Kickstarter at the moment

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,480
with people building very cool devices

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,310
on a bun too and we want to make it

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,780
really easy for them to do that and get

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,150
all the benefits that we've that we've

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,610
provided for the phone ecosystem where

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,670
they can get instant updates automatic

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,240
transactional updates atomic updates of

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,490
both the both the system and images so

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,980
so beyond the desktop I think you'll see

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,390
a lot of those core technologies in a

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,550
bun two that were pioneered for the

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,620
phone becoming available for Mike

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,020
receivers for servers themselves for

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,360
cloud environments and for wear and four

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,830
instead of things type devices so lots

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
of very cool stuff there for those of

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,960
you who are into hackery on the weekends

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,060
and and playing with Arduino or

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,440
developer boards from different

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,650
architectures there's lots of

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,660
interesting stuff coming there so moving

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,640
on to the cloud and I think it's worth

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,229
restating that cloud is one of those

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,690
environments where you know a bun two

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:02,580
leads very strongly so we have we carry

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,710
some broad some big responsibilities on

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,640
our shoulders as a community when we put

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,950
out updates to a cloud images those go

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,560
to a very very large cross-section of

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,140
the world's cloud infrastructures and

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,669
cloud workloads and something like sixty

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,290
to seventy percent of all of the

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,229
workloads running other public clouds

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,419
are running on ubuntu and something like

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,880
fifty to sixty percent of all of the

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,550
private clouds built on OpenStack and

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,130
are on a bunt 0 as well so it's a very

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:37,140
substantial responsibility that we carry

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:39,930
and if I look across the OpenStack

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,940
ecosystem a bunch of clearly stands out

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:47,220
as the platform of choice for OpenStack

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,690
deployments and that's even more true if

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,450
you look at the very large deployments

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,400
about in fact at the OpenStack somewhat

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,380
recently they had eight

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,870
superuser clouds they would they were

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,480
calling them very large deployments and

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,860
seven of them were we're all on a blunt

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,720
ooh so there's a lot of work to be done

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,360
and we play a very important role in

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,690
that ecosystem and I want to thank

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,670
everybody who helps shape both the

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,220
OpenStack packages in a boom tube but

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:18,330
also the broader environment for cloud

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,910
users and cloud deployers on ubuntu for

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,920
those of you who don't know OpenStack

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,690
fits the bunch of release process very

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,880
very well they also have a six-month

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,670
cadence it's nicely lined up with ours

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,670
that's no accident and it goes back to

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,170
the very early days of OpenStack when

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,060
the core OpenStack developers were all

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,430
working on a bun too and now honestly

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,020
OpenStack is much wider wider much more

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,870
general but there is still a lot of

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,110
overlap in our process and in the

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,490
OpenStack community there are at the

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,030
moment four different ways that people

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:53,370
can get OpenStack on a bun too and we

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,830
package all of the pieces of OpenStack

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,570
and we and because OpenStack moves at

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,330
quite a fast pace itself within six

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,780
months cadence we have a separate set of

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:07,290
PDAs and where we publish each

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,570
incremental release of OpenStack for LTS

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,580
users so on LTS you can always get the

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,330
latest packages for the latest version

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,760
of OpenStack and we also recommend juju

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,550
charms the charms for OpenStack are our

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,010
first class and they're all in Python

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,990
they handle lots of permutations and

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,740
combinations of different OpenStack

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,360
backends and plugins very well and of

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,240
course they give you an elasticity and

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,690
ability to shrink and grow your cloud as

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,490
you need it and we're also building an

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,820
OpenStack reference install into

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,310
landscape which is Canonical's and

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,780
management platform for Ubuntu and then

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,880
there are several partners who've built

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,800
their own OpenStack solutions on top of

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,810
them to as well so it's a very vibrant

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,270
ecosystem there's lots going on those of

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,340
you who haven't yet taken time to build

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,410
a small OpenStack I really think you'd

00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,410
be amazed at and how lightweight

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,660
OpenStack can be you know it's a it's a

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,300
big beast of code it's a huge

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,139
distributed system but if you if you

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,470
focus on you

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:12,540
juju using charms you can actually bring

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,730
it up very very very easily and then you

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,040
can evolve it over time and grow it so

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,230
there's lots of interesting stuff

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,089
happening there and just to give you

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,980
some sense of the industry participation

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,569
here's a list of companies that are

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,999
actively using Ubuntu OpenStack so

00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:31,410
participating in this is is really

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,699
interesting you you're right at the

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,249
cutting edge of what the biggest

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,649
institutions are describing as their

00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,059
next-generation infrastructure so

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,889
there's this huge amounts of really good

00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,609
work going on there and that's on the

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,790
back of a whole series of firsts in

00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:50,609
cloud in in a bun to we were the first

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,759
to really embrace the public cloud and

00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:56,669
publish official fresh images you can

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,009
find those now on every major cloud we

00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:00,600
have the next major cloud due to be

00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,540
announced in a couple of weeks time I

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,399
went I went jump the gun on the

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,939
announcement but I'm very excited to be

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,739
to be continuing to bring the biggest

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,540
club unto to the biggest clouds out

00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:14,069
there I think it's really important in

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,980
our mission to support developers that

00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:19,350
we are everywhere and that we're fresh

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,970
everywhere so that's that's a great and

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,850
important we were obviously the first to

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,850
adopt OpenStack the first to use kbm as

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,519
our recommended baked in hypervisor

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,439
those two jobs safe the first to do a

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,309
lot of work around live migration which

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:34,889
is really important if you're running

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,449
clouds at scale cloud in it is

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,679
technology that we've pioneered and

00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:40,860
right now the thing that I'm most

00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:44,489
excited about is containerization and

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,369
with that Linux containers lxc which is

00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,929
a substantial community it is about 60

00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:51,869
different companies participating in

00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,730
alexion Linux containers but we leave

00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:56,879
that in a bun too I think two of the key

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,939
developers in LXE work with us full-time

00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,269
and so a bun to really is the best place

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:05,999
to break the ice with Linux containers

00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,549
and those of you who haven't spent an

00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:10,529
afternoon going through the sort of

00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:13,109
Linux containers tutorial step by step

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,089
guide and I really recommend it it will

00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:17,989
blow you away you know if you compute

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,310
any linux distro you know in seconds on

00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:22,620
on your laptop and

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,540
you can run many containers compared to

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,640
the number of kayvyun virtual machines

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,880
that you can run on a laptop obviously

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,940
you can't do windows on on LXE you'd

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,130
need kvm for that but you can do any

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,660
linux on linux virtualization

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,940
essentially in LXE and it's much faster

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,860
much lighter and it's the basis for

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,589
things like dhaka which are really

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,660
important technologies in terms of app

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,760
distribution and app publication on a

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,900
bun too but generally on the cloud and

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,440
and in the future of most scale-out type

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:59,130
environments this is this next picture

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,440
is the thing that that i think is most

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,160
interesting when we think about you know

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,279
how cloud is changing people's practices

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,710
if I think of how I got involved with

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,170
Linux it was on the server side and it

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:18,150
was because I wanted to set up web

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:21,270
services and Internet services and Linux

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,770
was the best way to do that and today if

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,000
you look at the statistics most people

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,400
seem to feel that a blunt is the best

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,470
way to do that so people setting servers

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,610
up is a is a key sort of audience for us

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,200
but I think what's really important is

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,780
to look ahead and say you know what

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,430
happens as we scale this up as

00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,020
infrastructure's get bigger and bigger

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,910
as it all gets richer and more complex

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:47,730
and the key meme the key thing is

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,560
automation this is great info graphic

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,810
here which says you know how many and

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,050
this is all about the number of human

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,760
beings you have and the number of

00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,740
physical servers you have and the ratio

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,470
of physical servers to human beings in

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,440
your operation now I know it canonical

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,990
you know we have we have about 20 25

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,839
people who work on physical servers and

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,270
we've got a couple of hundred servers

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,850
and then a bunch of more virtual servers

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,360
on top of that so a fairly decent ratio

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,920
of machines that we manage to 22 people

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,100
doing the managing and obviously we've

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,040
got a lot of complex things going on so

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,930
that warrants a certain amount of

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,230
stewardship but if you look at the

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:33,480
really big guys the Amazons and the

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,019
googles and the facebooks the ratio of

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,999
human

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,619
of physical machines to human beings is

00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:40,079
pretty extraordinary at Facebook its

00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:41,939
twenty four thousand to one twenty four

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,089
thousand to one that gives you about six

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:49,709
seconds per server per person per year

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:53,220
so clearly automation is critical and I

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:55,379
think we're really a pioneering this

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,709
world you know even at a much smaller

00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,410
scale and all of the interesting systems

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:04,199
are distributed systems now you know

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:09,679
when we when we first started setting up

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:13,739
linux systems with debian and ubuntu and

00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:15,449
you've set up a system on a machine you

00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,730
know you might sit a database or you

00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:19,139
might set up a web server you might

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,769
serve a set up a database and a web

00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,779
server on a single machine today the

00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:26,730
really interesting systems first they

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,209
have many more components so you've got

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,100
load balancers and app servers and data

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,929
containers and so on and second those

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,939
component cook components themselves are

00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,939
typically spread out over many machines

00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:41,910
and so the architectures of systems

00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:44,279
today are much richer and much more

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,529
complex and much more prone to failure

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:51,089
and much more operationally challenging

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:53,850
than they ever were ten years ago and so

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,490
so I think it's really interesting for

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,019
us to pioneer this field of distributed

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,059
systems if I look at what people are

00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,639
actually using a bun to to build their

00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:06,389
all distributed systems and so it's very

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,949
interesting for us to to delve into this

00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:10,860
and figure out how we can bring that

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,839
magical abun to touch to distributed

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,130
systems we have always been known as a

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,480
community for figuring out what's

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,839
important and figure out how to make

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,699
that really easy to get right and so if

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,919
we say well distributed systems are

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,809
important then figuring out how to make

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,669
those distributed systems really easy to

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,130
do that would very much be in keeping

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:32,940
with that the ground the trails that

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,580
we've blazedd in the past and so juju is

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,190
our key kind of push in that regard now

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,350
we did announce at the recent OpenStack

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,659
7th that juju's being ported to sent us

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,770
and two windows which is pretty cool

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,100
right it's a piece of open-source

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,960
software that does amazing orchestration

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,480
and it will be not tied to have gone to

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,309
in any way we'd leave it but there are

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,020
now lots of other people coming to that

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,820
ecosystem and I think supporting other

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,799
Linux distributions and windows is a

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,720
very very interesting development that's

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,429
been driven by other people who have a

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,679
need for that and we're happy to land

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:10,200
and merge the patches but I think it

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,600
starts to make juju and more rounded

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,690
ecosystem more rounded community which

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,580
is great on the next slide this is a

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,740
little picture of the sorts of stuff you

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,070
can do with juju this is the award

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,860
winning entry or the winning entry in a

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,140
competition that we ran about a year ago

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,630
just to explore what people could do

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,580
with the existing set of charms that was

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,530
available charms or the individual sort

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,710
of units of service orchestration that

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,850
you that juju works with and if you if

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,760
you know what this picture is doing it's

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,970
pretty amazing it is a sort of like an

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,400
open-source plonk you can you spin this

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,919
up at almost any scale on any cloud

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,780
using juju and then you can you can

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,970
connect it up to any big system that's

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,669
generating lots of logs and do really

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,890
interesting analytics and visualization

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:02,159
and searching and querying of those logs

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,990
through cabana and elastic search so

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,080
there's some pretty sophisticated stuff

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,059
going on and here and and it's it's

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,760
quite stunning to people when they see

00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,450
how easily they can get this all up and

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,039
running the ecosystem around Juju's is

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,350
growing very nicely so we talked about

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,710
Microsoft joining with with support for

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,559
Windows and support for charms of

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,260
Windows applications most of these

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,450
companies are in the telecommunication

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,610
space or they are involved with their

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,679
names distributed systems if you're a

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,270
company that sells essentially a product

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,679
that is a distributed system sets a

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:43,890
Hadoop product or another kind of

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,320
distributed platform then having the

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,090
ability to very quickly spin that up on

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,909
a cloud for customers for them to

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,250
evaluate or or integrate is is really

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:55,080
valuable so a lot of these companies are

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,750
people who sell distributed solutions

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,309
distributed systems solutions and all

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,840
people who you know who need to be able

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:04,799
to absorb those solutions

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,210
very quickly and efficiently our mission

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,710
statement here is that you should be

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,890
able to take any software and get it

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,990
onto any cloud on any architecture we've

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,049
shown this working on x86 arm and

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,770
PowerPC we've shown it working on ec2

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:23,490
Azure OpenStack joint and and many other

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,650
clouds as well and a key goal for me is

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,080
that we were able to embrace any kind of

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,150
new technology that comes along for app

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,070
delivery or configuration management so

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:37,830
docker is an example of a sweet new way

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,870
to deliver a nap and we should be able

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,380
to have a juju charm that that consumes

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,580
docker images and we do and then all of

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,649
the different ways that people like to

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,029
do configuration management are

00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,950
supported in there as well so you can

00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,250
essentially charm something up using

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,110
whatever tools you like for you know

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,179
having configuration management or and

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,850
delivering the apps could be packaging

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,159
if these are charms of things that are

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,020
in the archives but it could also be you

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,899
know curl if you need to go and fetch

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,970
the code from from from revision control

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,669
or from wherever you deliver your

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,350
snapshots from and it's really important

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,899
that this work on all the clouds and on

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,750
bare metal and on vert so a pretty

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,880
amazing new ecosystem that's forming and

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:26,460
I want to thank all of the charmers who

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,840
are so active there there's a amazing

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,309
amount that you can do today if you go

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,260
to juju charms com you can connect and

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,350
and integrate an amazing number of

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,270
things a focus for us right now is the

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,029
field of past platform-as-a-service and

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,409
i think that there's as you know a whole

00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:45,990
new set of ecosystems that's going to

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:49,880
grow up around pears and a lot of the

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:54,570
passes today use ubuntu so Heroku and

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:57,090
cloud foundry days and any number of

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,559
other passes use and make heavy use of

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,169
ubuntu so we want to support them we

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,140
want to help them bring their stuff too

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,270
and the widest possible audience and

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,799
that the parts that they're made up of

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,929
are very interesting and reusable parts

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,030
you know as we as we charm up something

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,590
by cloud foundry we're also charming up

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,040
some interesting pieces that other

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,500
people

00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,270
like to use as well certainly we've seen

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,150
with OpenStack that charming OpenStack

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,980
drove and the quality and usability of

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,860
the charms for all of the middleware

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,140
pieces and messaging systems and

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,200
databases and so on that go into making

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,590
a big OpenStack deployment surpasses the

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,470
focus at the moment as is Big Data we

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,960
are currently working with a variety of

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,310
of folks interested in Hadoop if you are

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,500
interested in Hadoop and you want an

00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,680
amazing way to get Hadoop up and running

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,990
then this is a push that you want to be

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,030
involved in there are 17 different

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,620
pieces of code from Apache that are

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,890
interesting and useful and then of

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,300
course there are all the the new HBase

00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,710
equivalents and replacements that are

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,720
coming along it would not be it would be

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,970
great to have drop-in pluggable

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,650
replacements and so that you can deploy

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,520
something with Apache Hadoop but then

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:14,030
also try something with and some of the

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:18,360
very cool new age base replacements that

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,760
that we see popping up that is pretty

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,270
much it from me and I'd be very keen to

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:37,020
take questions and so I hand it back to

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:39,210
Michael Mike I think you're muted yes I

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,950
was sorry about that so we've got quite

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,380
a few questions we'll get through as

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,270
many of them as we can if you haven't

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,400
started it with the word question in all

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,550
caps then it's probably not going to be

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,640
on my list all right so just start us

00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:58,830
out vasil asks why didn't you just lock

00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:02,910
jaw know in a basement and yeah I'm

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:05,130
extremely African and and the movement

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,670
is made or their prize is a fascinating

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,100
as nation asked he's got a really unique

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:14,550
variability to PT around there's

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:19,560
anything Ellen so so I was delighted for

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:20,640
him in in that move and and and hate to

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,490
think that I might have anybody locked

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,260
up in a basement and I'm also delighted

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,730
with with

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,650
you know the momentum that we have in

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,490
the community and have no doubt that

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,130
we'll continue that momentum so thanks

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,420
for your concern but I think John oh and

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:44,280
i are both relieved that neither of us

00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:46,680
picked that strategy all right uh canari

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:50,400
asks when can I see the bun tube phone

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,820
the actual hardware I think you can see

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,460
it this week in Shanghai where the first

00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:01,860
prototypes of that are being shown and

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:04,260
there will be two devices and so i'm not

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,440
sure if both of them are on show but

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:14,670
certainly one of them is in shanghai

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:16,020
this week or next week Zigor wants to

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,330
know how are we going to ensure that

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,950
existing desktop applications will

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,100
continue to be supported in our

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,870
converged future isn't that interesting

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,700
question so I I gotta tell you I was

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:31,740
super excited because at during the

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:35,280
Sprint I saw G edit running on unity 8

00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,380
and it was on Mir and it was looking

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,150
pretty sweet so you know there are lots

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,430
of lots of issues and lots of gaps to be

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,870
close but we expect to provide full

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,270
support for all of the important tool

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,530
kits which means you should get all of

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,480
the apps that you know in love and

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,400
should be there there's lots of

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,810
interesting sort of gaps to be closed

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,920
and problems to be solved so if that's

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,280
an interesting problem for you then

00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,080
climb in and at work with the

00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,590
communities the guys who are who are

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,150
nailing that but you know I wouldn't say

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,280
it's quite to the point where it

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,100
compiles so we'll ship it and this

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,550
definitely stuff to be done but but you

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,370
know the first the first gtk and other

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,310
tool kit apps are up and running on mere

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,720
in in a unity 8 environment and it's

00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:24,510
gonna it's going to get very interesting

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:27,420
from here on out tonari again is asking

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,280
why don't you create an m OC for a bunt

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,980
too I'd love to write an application as

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,440
a very very normal user I'm not quite

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,920
sure what an mo c is are you familiar

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,669
with that I think it's a massively a

00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,879
mess

00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:45,109
of online course isn't it is that a

00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:45,109
training course that you're referring to

00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:49,889
ignore if you could give us some

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:55,889
additional information on that will come

00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:59,070
back to you seeis acids a bunt to more

00:26:55,889 --> 00:27:03,509
efficient than Windows is it more

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,309
efficient than windows that's a very

00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,840
broad question I definitely think there

00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,669
are many things that run faster on

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,600
Ubuntu then run on Windows I think

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,590
people have talked about for example

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,919
gaming frame rates and for example steam

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:19,350
on Ubuntu aren't performing steam on

00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,409
windows and so that's very encouraging I

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,119
think there'll be areas where Windows is

00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:27,359
probably more efficient to you know so I

00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,999
think that kind of speculation leads us

00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,889
to be smug and we probably shouldn't do

00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:33,330
that we should just focus on on the

00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:37,710
areas where we know we've got room to

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:41,460
improve and go and crack on this all

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:44,249
right sit hat asks what is OpenStack and

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,070
I would add what is our involvement in

00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:49,799
that have we contributed right what is

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,809
what is OpenStack well OpenStack is

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,899
cloud software its software that lets

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:57,470
you build a cloud so imagine if you've

00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:59,669
got five or ten linux systems and

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,470
instead of going to each of them

00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:02,909
manually and logging in what you want to

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,639
be able to do is you won't be able to go

00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:08,190
to a web interface and and ask for

00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:10,850
virtual machines on demand and have

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,169
those virtual machines created

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,049
automatically on you know whichever

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:18,659
machine is least loaded or most

00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,869
available or best suits the specific

00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,039
kind of the end that you want to create

00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:25,440
OpenStack is the software that does that

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:29,480
so it's a way of taking a cluster of

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,480
ubuntu machines or linux machines and

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,299
providing a web interface and and rest

00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:38,730
api that you can use to create virtual

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:40,739
machines dynamically on demand so it's a

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,190
way to build a little cloud out of a

00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:45,629
cluster of a bunch of machines and we've

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,179
been part of a per sec we were one of

00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:49,710
the founding members of OpenStack we

00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,230
have a bunch of people who work on it

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,360
most of our focus is on

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,919
production readiness and quality so we

00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,250
have a good track record in terms of

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,650
number of bugs fixed in OpenStack we are

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,360
less focused on sort of adding features

00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,400
to OpenStack our house view is that

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,660
what's really needed is a deep dive on

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,419
quality and that's what we're best

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,890
placed to do because the majority of the

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,230
OpenStack clouds that are in production

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,510
are unable to and so we through

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,820
supporting them and addressing the

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,040
issues that they find are able to kind

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,200
of lead the way on making OpenStack

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,150
production ready we also do a lot of

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,770
work on interoperability right a key

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,400
sort of philosophy for us is that they

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:31,520
shouldn't just be one stack and we want

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,750
to support many different vendors I

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,640
deleted a slide on the number of vendors

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,520
that that are currently integrated with

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,530
us but it's up to 18 now in six months

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,960
who've gone and joined a program called

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:46,230
oil the OpenStack interrupt lab that we

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,929
lead and and all of those vendors are

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,570
writing juju charms so you can build a

00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:54,299
cloud very quickly and efficiently and

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,650
using their components you know mixing

00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,330
and matching their components it's

00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,850
pretty cool if you haven't played with

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:02,910
OpenStack and you have a couple of

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,160
machines sort of spare then you can

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,840
build an OpenStack very easily with juju

00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,940
charms in fact in the next couple of

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,010
months and we'll publish a tool that

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,850
will let you with a single command you

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:21,960
know build that little cloud and we are

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:24,330
also going to publish a way for you to

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,919
create take a single machine and turn it

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,809
into a cloud using exactly the same

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,360
charms so a really efficient way to kind

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:34,799
of just hack on OpenStack and yourself

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:37,410
it's very cool stuff take a look all

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,510
right DS shimmer wants to know does the

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,000
cloud and OpenStack development lead to

00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:44,370
revenue streams and how is it support

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,630
contracts licensing or paid development

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:50,160
hmm I postech work is commercial so if

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,630
you think of the biggest OpenStack

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,730
deployments that have announced so far

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,710
most of them the vast majority of them

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,929
are on a bunt too and most of them are

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,669
commercially engaging either us or one

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:03,330
of our partners and through the partners

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:05,760
and for support so that we can help them

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,350
you know make that cloud both efficient

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,720
and we understand a lot about how you

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:13,920
best architect those clouds and and also

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,180
supported there are lots of little

00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,300
issues that creep up when you're

00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,520
exercising Ubuntu and relax in this way

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,860
and so many people do choose to have a

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,750
commercial engagement with us all of the

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,670
charms are open-source juju itself is

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,300
open source or the packages are open

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,950
source and customers do get access to

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,810
landscape which is the management

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,540
solution which will do a whole bunch of

00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,100
automated things you know keeping the

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,570
cloud up to date and it will even build

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,290
the cloud to a very high standard

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:45,090
reference architecture that we maintain

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,930
as well so there are some features that

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,970
we make available just to customers but

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:54,360
all of the primitives all of the charms

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:59,700
all the packages and our are open source

00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,590
free software all right changing topic a

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,360
little bit here we have a question are

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,150
there any design mockups for the new

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,890
converged unity desktop we're speaking

00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:12,150
at about your conversation with the

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:14,850
design team earlier and their odd but I

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:19,050
think unity seven reflects fairly

00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:20,780
clearly the mechanics there'll be some

00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,870
changes to the way we do things like

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,580
workspaces and app switching because of

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,790
convergence you know we have some new

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,670
mechanisms there with the right edge and

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:36,270
the fan display and so on for for app

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:39,060
switching which will be relevant for for

00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:42,510
for unity eight on the desktop but the

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,220
core ideas of you know where everything

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,500
are laid out those are changing very

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,020
much between unity seven which is what

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,280
we currently have and immunity a you

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,710
know a lot of the work that we did in

00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,410
unity seven was to test and exercise

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,910
some of those layouts and propositions

00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,160
and that we're pretty happy with how

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,750
they everything fits together if you

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,250
look at the phone and then stretch that

00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,750
to the tablet then stretch that to your

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,430
current desktop it gives you a really

00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:10,950
clean idea of how all the pieces fit

00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:12,630
together okay the next two questions are

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,730
kind of similar so I'm going to merge

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,370
them into one and that is uh can we

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,350
expect to return to Ubuntu one cloud

00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,870
sync service or

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:26,010
is there anything planned to replace

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:28,350
that no I think we've established that

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:31,160
there are really good options out there

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:37,190
from a bunch of different companies and

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:39,960
Dropbox Google box and others and and

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,410
and those companies are operating at a

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,799
scale that makes them a better option

00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:49,380
for a user of Oakland to them Ubuntu one

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,000
would be I think we build some really

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,530
unique experience you know I talked

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,510
about distributed systems earlier

00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:58,590
distributed systems at scale are

00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:02,159
challenging are hard and we had you know

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,950
a petabyte odd of of storage and that

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,289
we're managing as part of a bun 21 and

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,879
it really exercised a lot of what we it

00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:10,859
helped us shape a lot of what we think

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,960
about large-scale distributed systems

00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,629
today so I'm very glad that we did it

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,639
and and our goal now is to make it easy

00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:19,800
for people to transition to commercial

00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,230
offerings from you know a very large

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,929
ecosystem of providers I don't think we

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:30,750
will return to that as a market okay i

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,700
need a nick s what i think is a very

00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,859
interesting question is how will a bunch

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:38,580
of prevent fragmentation that is a

00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,929
problem with android ah so if you're

00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,730
interested in that then you're

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:44,669
interested in our mechanisms for image

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,070
updates on every single ubuntu phone

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:49,889
device and tablet device will have

00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,570
exactly the same core image all the same

00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:55,639
versions all the same libraries all the

00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:57,660
same and core apps will all be there

00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,550
carriers will be able to add

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,710
applications they'll be able to add

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,960
scopes which show up as sort of the

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,820
default experience on the home page but

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,369
all of that is configurable by you the

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,280
user as well so carriers are essentially

00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:13,590
doing things you know that that you

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,540
yourself could do and which you can undo

00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,250
and that's a very strong proof of

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,109
principle that we've held out and which

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,780
has been accepted by all of our carrier

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:24,060
partners so that that makes a bloom to a

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,730
much cleaner much tighter much more

00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,160
crispy defined platform than then

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,510
Android is and all of those parts are

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,500
open source if you want to take them and

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,440
go and make your own platform you

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,660
certainly can

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:39,490
but the average of 12 device across all

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:41,589
manufacturers across all operators will

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:45,099
have exactly the same courses tomb image

00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:46,510
and and when we push an update that

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:52,270
update to be available to everybody

00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:54,640
equally alright the next question is

00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,980
will being a gamer on a bun to be less

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,319
of a limiting factor anytime soon I

00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:05,800
gather that's probably related to the

00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:07,810
steam support now that we have um not

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,030
sure how I can alter that I think my

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,829
understanding is that steam on Ubuntu is

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,760
as good as steam on any other platform

00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:18,010
and sorry as good on any other Linux as

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,690
any other Linux platform and the

00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,089
catalogue of games is pretty impressive

00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,849
I think we're up to 300 or so games in

00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:27,790
steam on linux which is which is pretty

00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,470
fantastic and so you know if you have

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,599
specific requests and so on and you're

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:34,000
willing to put your your money where

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,560
your mouth is then I think knocking on

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,589
steam's door you know that'll be well

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:43,660
received dish mrs when you talk about

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,460
partners what might that mean for

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,050
practical basis what are some

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,790
hypothetical examples of what a

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,560
partnership between canonical and

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,710
another major player may mean in the

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,250
free day life well so for example we

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,829
just announced a partnership with

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:02,980
marantis they have their own OpenStack

00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:04,900
solution and which they are willing to

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,790
install on a bloom to and support on

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,950
Ubuntu and in that environment we will

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,650
support a gun to both below and above

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,470
the line essentially we will support

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,790
ubuntu as the host OS and also in cases

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,819
where people are using ubuntu as a guest

00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,980
will support that so we're working with

00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,359
them and their OpenStack distribution as

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,980
well as having our own OpenStack

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:25,480
distribution and they're quite a lot of

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,420
companies that are doing that neta cloud

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,280
is another one and cisco has an

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:36,310
OpenStack distribution that uses an

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:39,040
ubuntu and so I think we've been the

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,770
most open linux platform to such

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,770
partnerships and giving people the most

00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,150
choice and as to the number of ways they

00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:51,369
can consume OpenStack

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:54,309
on a budget all right the next one is

00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:56,799
will unity eight replace unity seven on

00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:59,109
utopic unicorn or will it be an optional

00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:01,210
testbed it's definitely not going to

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:04,690
replace unity seven our new topic and

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,549
but and it will be possible to have a

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,339
play with it on you topic and I think

00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:11,619
that's going to be very cool so so look

00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:13,539
out for that and you know it should be

00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,490
pretty easy to have it as a separate

00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:17,740
server desktop session that you can log

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,140
into occasion if you have a touchscreen

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,029
laptop that's going to be a pretty

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,789
interesting experience although it's not

00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,630
a sort of core focus for the cycle you

00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,619
know they're lots of folks are

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:31,660
passionate about making that happen and

00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,309
there is a session I believe tomorrow or

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,450
thursday about how we're going to

00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:39,910
provide that session d simmer again is

00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,980
asking as an everyday desktop only user

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,410
what are the most important technologies

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,380
or systems in the hottest ecosystems

00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:50,890
mobile war cloud that will benefit me as

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:53,770
they trickle down so were you talking

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:59,230
about ecosystems on the back end or on

00:38:53,770 --> 00:39:01,900
the front end I think he means stuff on

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,750
the back end and how he'll how that will

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,750
benefit him I think the really

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,819
interesting and story on the on the back

00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:14,140
end is is the speed at which people are

00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:16,029
moving to scale out and you know when

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,500
Linux first broke into the sort of

00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:19,240
commercial environment it was very much

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,240
about running a database or running a

00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,220
single system very well now it's it's

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,020
this challenge of running tens hundreds

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,900
thousands of systems very effectively

00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,609
and so most of the gene pool for that

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,180
work is happening on the public cloud

00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:38,500
and obviously there are a bunch of key

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:40,539
clouds and ec2 I would not real out Asia

00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,900
you know I think the Microsoft team and

00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:46,720
have done a very credible job of

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,869
building a platform neutral cloud

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,059
infrastructure and and we continue to

00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:55,299
see performance and scale improvements

00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:57,789
happening there Rackspace HP cloud

00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:59,830
coming on strong OpenStack making it

00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:03,970
much easier for other people too

00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:06,160
took to create and new entrance to the

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:10,450
cloud market so so you'll see a lot more

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,880
and specialized clouds emerging as a pub

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,470
as OpenStack and cheers now layered on

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,490
top of that I think the key big

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:19,990
ecosystems now are big data because all

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,510
of these distributed systems are

00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:27,190
generating data at a at a tremendous

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:29,710
rate and and potentially platform as a

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,810
service although platform as a service

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,460
you know as a percentage of the number

00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,590
of workloads out there remains pretty

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,810
small it's very interesting from a

00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,550
developer experience point of view so

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,260
all of those ecosystems are interesting

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,560
right now I think the most interesting

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,920
for me is the Big Data one you know we

00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,420
weave it's sort of incredible and how it

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,550
changes the way you think as you start

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,040
to be able to work with large amounts of

00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,630
data that has been very difficult to do

00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,700
you know setting up a tube setting up

00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,710
and these big infrastructures has been

00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,440
very challenging but juju is making it

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,820
really really easy to do and I think

00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,580
we're going to unleash a lot of

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,580
creativity and innovation in that regard

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,580
that leads us kind of into the next

00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,650
question is there any benefit to

00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:19,390
canonical by supporting more platforms

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:23,020
on the cloud front um yes I think so you

00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:25,900
know I I believe in open ecosystems and

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,510
it was a bit of a an awkwardness for us

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,790
that ug was only supporting a boon to as

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:34,090
a platform that wasn't an awkwardness by

00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,770
design and it was an awkwardness by you

00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,540
know racing fast to get the interesting

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,970
features added on the platforms that you

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,060
have access to and and care about and

00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,830
and I think it took a little while for

00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,630
people to understand just how

00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,220
interesting juju is and for other

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,290
communities to start to sort of get

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,930
interested I was really delighted when

00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:55,810
the windows you know code was offered to

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,850
us it came you know as I'm not very nice

00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,130
surprise and we're very happy to be

00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,690
integrating it and but equally so would

00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,700
sent us and in fact we're going to go a

00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,620
little further with centos we're

00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,140
actually going to publish sent us images

00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,780
to make it easy for people to use juju

00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,070
and sent us together and because you

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,720
know sent us is an important platform

00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,720
it's fairly widely used

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,119
or an older workloads which grew up in a

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,160
different era I think most of the scale

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,840
app distributed workloads are already on

00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,280
a book too but some of those may be on

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,680
sent us to or people may have a

00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,700
preference for them so I think it's good

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,650
for us to to stand behind the promise of

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,480
openness we do that on the desktop by

00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,599
supporting other people's desktop

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,480
environments right and we do that on the

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,910
cloud by doing what we can to to to

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,950
support interoperability between

00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:49,990
different platforms both linux and other

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:52,359
other environments as well so this next

00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:54,550
one is a little bit vague but we'll see

00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:57,630
what we can do how will the bun to touch

00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,609
cater to the needs of Android users

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,680
that's interesting and I think there's

00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:05,230
some really interesting work we can do

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,630
to make android applications easily

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,010
available and consumable on a go-to they

00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,590
will always be a bit limited because

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,810
android doesn't make the same sort of

00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:18,490
team promises about how you can use the

00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:19,660
system and you know their buttons and

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,520
various other things that they have to

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,599
sort of fudge into the into the into the

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,030
interface and but i think it should be

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,619
possible for android developers to get

00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,930
their application onto a bunch of really

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,510
easily and so we have a couple of

00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,510
different threads you know involved on

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,730
you know exploring how to make that a

00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,630
great experience for those developers

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:45,099
and otherwise you know for Android users

00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,580
you know if you love Android I think

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,859
that's great and you you you might want

00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,089
to explore a broader limit ecosystem you

00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:54,070
know you might want to explore that

00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:56,230
convergence idea I think it's very very

00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,450
interesting very powerful perhaps

00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:00,670
Android will do that to it from a design

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,070
point of view I think we have a really

00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:12,339
really beautiful starting position in

00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:14,320
that game Prince 0601 as the phone page

00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:17,080
on the Ubuntu website says facebook

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,940
twitter dropbox evernote and the amazon

00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,460
will be available at launch does this

00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,260
mean native ubuntu sdk apps and if so

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,050
how much progress has been made on this

00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,430
front some of those apps are native with

00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,740
a

00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:31,079
provide an API that we can talk to it's

00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,940
it's pretty straightforward for us or

00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,000
our community to make a native

00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,460
application others will be a html5

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,980
applications and and that's why we put

00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,230
so much work into the into the html5 app

00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,450
framework and and we've done really well

00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,569
then you know it's it's amazingly smooth

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:51,210
now and from a performance point of view

00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:53,700
and we pick components that other key

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:58,710
industry partners seem to be picking as

00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:02,450
well so we have we were the first to say

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:06,059
we're going to be all WebKit blink and

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,980
Cordoba and that seems to be a platform

00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,690
that the chrome web apps are focused on

00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,480
as well so I think you'll see a really

00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,790
good experience for for html5 on a bunch

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:21,359
of the absolute will be as good as they

00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:23,460
are on Android or iOS all right the next

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,520
question is how is a bun to Nome doing

00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,750
and will there be a future for it I

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,700
think that community is done really well

00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,910
the latino guys have stepped up their

00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:35,099
passionate about gnome and I hope they

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,869
feel that we've made and the appropriate

00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,430
space and support of supporting

00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:41,940
infrastructure available for them to

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,500
excel I think they've taken choices very

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,349
very appropriately you know this last

00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,569
release was an LTS and they've they've

00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:50,010
treated it like an LTS so I think that's

00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:55,470
really important that you know users

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:57,089
have access to an LTS as well and as

00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,520
well as the sort of latest and greatest

00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:01,290
code so I'm quite proud of the work that

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,780
they've done and the work that we've

00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:08,609
done to support that community and hope

00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:11,609
they continue all right I need a nick s

00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:14,760
is the recent release of OS X Yosemite a

00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:16,380
thing of concern for a bunt too no not

00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,809
at all i don't think we can focus too

00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,160
much on what other platforms do and I

00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:24,450
think there's beautiful work in in in in

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,609
Yosemite and I us I think this is

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:29,490
interesting and great work in Android

00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:31,890
and Windows you know I I don't think we

00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,869
get stronger by by worrying too much

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,880
will buy dissing me the work of other

00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:37,470
platforms I think credibly over the last

00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,359
couple of years we showed an ability to

00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,140
lead in some areas and I've got to

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,900
respect the leaders

00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:48,090
and and admire the work of others when

00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:50,310
it's great you know alright vessel again

00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:55,320
with the important questions why did you

00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:57,300
name it unicorn well you comes around

00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:03,330
once every 13 years don't you think we

00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:05,670
should take the shot all right um next

00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,620
one can you please make a homepage where

00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:11,640
users can submit what hardware can be

00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:14,730
used in a bun too ah I think if you just

00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:18,270
google the punchy certified hardware you

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,820
find a list and if you want to

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,700
contribute to that list I think it might

00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:27,300
be yeah if you go to butcher calm /

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,980
certification you see a current sort of

00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,330
list if you want to contribute to that

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,610
list I guess you could do it on a wiki

00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,960
page but i think that list over there

00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,820
represents the stuff that we've actually

00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,820
tested and committed to keep working

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,880
okay julia is asking um not sure if you

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:49,490
would know this or not but will the B

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,110
cube phone have for cpu cores or eight

00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:56,040
that's not something I have an immediate

00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:58,140
answer to hand on and I know that it'll

00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,180
be deal soon which is quite a cool

00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:05,040
feature but I don't know about its its

00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:09,180
core count the illusionist wants to know

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,130
if you would visit Tunisia ah well I was

00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:15,210
actually in Tunisia a little while ago

00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:17,100
had a great opportunity to to visit and

00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:20,040
was really impressed with a vibrancy of

00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,260
the Linux ended 12 communities there and

00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:27,750
but I don't have any current plans to

00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:33,900
visit the next one will mere get support

00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:34,980
for nvidia and ati gaming market yes we

00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,230
are working with all of the major

00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:45,600
vendors and we're aligning around key

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:48,060
standards for OpenGL and video device

00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,170
memory sharing and access so I'm pretty

00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,420
confident that we'll have first-class

00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:53,500
support both for their mobile and their

00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:59,040
desktop platforms

00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:01,810
I did get an answer from a lead on the

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,520
phone integration side of things saying

00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:12,330
that the BQ device is a quad-core CPU

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:14,890
thanks Victor right box tropica as

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:18,010
LibreOffice be available on every form

00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:20,530
factor yes I think we will have a

00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:22,390
compatibility strategy for applications

00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,450
like libre office I don't want to jump

00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,980
the gun on that first class obviously is

00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:29,680
to get support for the LibreOffice

00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,600
toolkit in to famir into the LibreOffice

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,870
toolkit because then they can take full

00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,730
advantage of the full precision of the

00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,620
windowing mechanisms that we're that

00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,930
we're putting in place there and I know

00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,100
that a lot of the sort of niggling

00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,790
concerns that people have with

00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,770
LibreOffice on X and will be solved if

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:51,070
they use the native mere windowing

00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,570
mechanism but you know as a bridge as a

00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:56,160
bridge mechanism will have some backward

00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,160
compatibility mechanisms there too

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,990
here's a question we've been getting for

00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,140
about a year now is there any chance

00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:07,990
that the ubuntu edge will be released

00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:10,330
now that that project is is shelved

00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:13,390
unfortunately i think it was a

00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:15,610
pioneering you know trailblazing effort

00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:19,150
and and it's interesting to see how many

00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:21,310
of the cool attributes of the edge are

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,800
now showing up in mainstream hardware i

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:28,180
am very interested to see what Apple

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:31,810
does with their supply line of of

00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,320
sapphire screens and and very interested

00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:38,920
to see what what people do with the sort

00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,650
of next generation of GPUs and CPUs

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,150
which really our desktop class and so

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,650
you know right now we've concentrated

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,930
all of our efforts on making a great

00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:49,840
software platform for that that that

00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:53,770
next wave of hardware we won't do a

00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,360
physical device all right I'm going to

00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,340
try and get through some of the more

00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,440
interesting questions that we have left

00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,000
since we're running out of time DC

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,800
Williams asked do you see canonical

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,500
placing a focused effort on enterprise

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,140
adoption with OpenStack over the next 18

00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,640
months

00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:13,470
yes very much so you know 12 is already

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,620
amazingly prevalent in enterprise

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:18,690
environments amazingly prevalent but it

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:26,400
hasn't it's never really got the

00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:28,650
attention of the CIO but because of our

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,870
strong presence in the OpenStack

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,550
ecosystem people are not able to take

00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,470
all the Ubuntu that they're doing

00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,270
already in the enterprise environment

00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,950
and essentially declare it and say hey

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,870
these are all the places we're already

00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,370
using Ubuntu so it makes sense

00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:43,800
potentially for us to use it for this

00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:49,950
next bit of infrastructure so OpenStack

00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:51,540
has turned into a sort of a an awareness

00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,970
driver of awareness at the highest

00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,150
levels and enterprises of the important

00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,950
role that 12 is already playing in

00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,780
enterprise linux and I don't think

00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,120
OpenStack is the only story there though

00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,960
I mean even without OpenStack if i look

00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:10,950
at large financial institutions media

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,270
institutions and other enterprises and i

00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,870
look at what they're doing on public

00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:19,320
clouds on azure or on ec2 or on

00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:20,880
rackspace and many of them usable too

00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,950
and they actually shift two of them to

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,120
as they shift to the cloud and there are

00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,910
lots of things that we've done in a bun

00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,010
to that make it really sweet for for

00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:32,310
public cloud usage and obviously there's

00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,290
a huge and developer ecosystem around a

00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,760
bun to on those public lands so open

00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,860
stack is one part of it but I think the

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,630
public cloud is equally important in

00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:44,670
raising awareness it'll go to in

00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:47,010
enterprise environments right Cheryl s

00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:51,360
are the terms provided from microsoft

00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:54,980
also open source the challenge provided

00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,750
well different different charms sorry

00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:02,250
for a third party participation over

00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:03,750
here and different charms are going to

00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:06,150
be under different licenses we don't

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,650
earn the chance so vendors might have

00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,540
proprietary chance a matter of open

00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:11,220
source charms you might have proprietary

00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,690
charms of open source you might have

00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,990
open source charms of proprietary

00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:18,210
software and in the case of Microsoft

00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,930
applications I suspect the charms will

00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,670
sometimes be open source but obviously

00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:24,700
underlying apps that they're installing

00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:26,530
and are likely to be proprietary that

00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,480
said there are going to be open source

00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,030
charms of open source software on

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,980
Windows certainly for example the

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,630
OpenStack components that you can run on

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,540
windows will be charmed and those will

00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:39,100
be open source charms so is this pretty

00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,590
cool work happening there I hope it'll

00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,450
grow into a flourishing ecosystem and I

00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,280
would just think of charms as software

00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,870
you know there'll be software and the

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,600
different licenses that we charms under

00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,580
different licenses and those charms

00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,110
belong to those vendors so you know they

00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:58,090
will sit in appropriate license for

00:53:53,110 --> 00:54:00,100
therefore they work maestro is asking

00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:04,720
how is a bunch of doing in China what's

00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:07,660
the latest news so good chillin and has

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,480
had multiple million downloads i believe

00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,920
so they've had a very strong reception

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,530
in terms of people downloading and using

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,250
it there's a lot of work being done on

00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:20,640
ubuntu chillin both for back-end

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:23,920
infrastructure usage and also for

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,400
desktop usage and the chillin guys want

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,020
to pursue some new user interface ideas

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,900
so they'll be investing in that and we

00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,220
will support their efforts you know with

00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,820
to us that's just another desktop

00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,590
environment essentially and and you know

00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:43,720
I'm delighted to see them going from

00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:49,870
strength to strength juliet the thing is

00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:52,800
canonical worried about chromebooks I

00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:56,350
think Chromebooks are really interesting

00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,860
phenomenon in the PC space and I think

00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:01,240
that they you know the web is a very

00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,310
central application so it makes sense

00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,960
that there should be web oriented

00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,730
terminals and devices out there and

00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,920
Google's obviously super competent

00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:11,200
organization there are lots of

00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:14,680
opportunities for us to work with their

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,470
teams or for example chrome on Mir and

00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,180
has been a key area of focus for us and

00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:21,820
I think having a good relationship with

00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,810
the chrome team generally is is

00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:28,510
important and as for as for whether

00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,860
we're worried about it I think it's you

00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,530
know I can chrome as one of those sort

00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,460
of existential propositions if the web

00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,589
is the only plan

00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,180
form that matters on the client then

00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:42,490
chrome is going to be a wonderful way to

00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:44,910
do the web right so and if in fact the

00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:47,260
web eats everything will then kudos and

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:50,080
congratulations to to the chrome guys

00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,460
and possibly we'll see other web sort of

00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,830
based platforms but they will certainly

00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,920
you know I go down in history as having

00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:59,200
pioneered there if in fact there's room

00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,300
for divers native clients and so on then

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,920
I think you know more open more

00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,900
traditional platforms continue to play a

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,580
role so you know I think in life one

00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,710
doesn't sort of really sweat about the

00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,910
existential things too much of this and

00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:15,339
this you have a way to do something

00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,349
about it so from my part it's you know I

00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:19,630
kind of celebrate Chrome's growth

00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:22,150
because it helps drive then to support

00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:23,890
for Linux drivers for graphics drivers

00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,500
for sound and Wi-Fi and all of those

00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:28,839
sorts of things so I'm a little bit

00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,630
grateful for for every Chromebook that

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,190
ships and a little bit more grateful for

00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,349
river your blood to notebook that ships

00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:38,490
and there are many tens of millions of

00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:40,599
those and so that's how I would frame it

00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,570
Michael we're on the hour what do you

00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:44,980
think yep um I think we will go ahead

00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,680
and call it there are far too many

00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,810
questions to get through them all so

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,460
thank you everyone for asking the

00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:54,250
