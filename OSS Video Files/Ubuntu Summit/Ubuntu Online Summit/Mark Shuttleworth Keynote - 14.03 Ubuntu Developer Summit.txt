Joan of economic economical is the evil

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,429
to community manager I'm delighted to be

00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:59,079
joined by Mark Shuttleworth who is the

00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:02,199
founder of ubuntu and of canonical marks

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,519
gonna give a keynote today and at the

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,290
end of it as usual we're going to have a

00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,140
Q&A sessions if you've got burning

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,360
questions about about a bun to across

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,070
the client and the cloud story about

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
canonical on what we're doing then this

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,740
is where you can get answers to your

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,150
questions so I just want to tell you how

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,380
you ask a question so you can get

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,810
questions in as we go through this

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,490
session and then when we're done with

00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,440
mark we can go through them one by one

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,850
so all you need to do is type the word

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,210
question in capital letters are up the

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,490
case and please don't repeat the same

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,470
question over and over again and i'm

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,430
gonna i'm going to keep a log of them

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,620
all and we'll get through his maze

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,240
weekend when we're done this is also not

00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,220
really the best venue for technical

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,900
support queries if your graphics cards

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,340
not working mark probably not

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,530
necessarily the best person to ask about

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,120
that so this is more about things that

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,790
relate to the direction the focus that

00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,580
we've got with book too so without

00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,860
further ado I'll hand over to mark Thank

00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,310
You Jonah hello everybody it's it's

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,659
great to be back I hope that the UDS is

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,610
treating you really well I have to say

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,190
that the continued improvement in

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,360
iteration on the format is very exciting

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,850
to watch you know we've always been

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,889
trying to pioneer new ways to get

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,719
communities together new new kinds of

00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,959
communities to get together new new

00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,010
tools to use with communities and just

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,080
in the last

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,450
yeah I think they've been a bunch of

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,700
great steps forward and one of those has

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,069
been hangouts and hangouts on air I want

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,290
to thank the the various track leads and

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,840
team leads for doing such a great job of

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,629
communicating all you know what's going

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,810
on we're a huge project and but I can

00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,280
hop on and watch a 5-10 minute video and

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,040
I know exactly what's going on from the

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,629
desktop group I can hop on watch a 5-10

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,519
minute video and I know what's going on

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,500
in the kernel in foundations in various

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,780
other pieces and I think that's super

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,459
valuable and with that I guess comes an

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,609
invitation and a request for new ideas

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,549
as we grow as a project as we expand

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,750
it's always great to find new tools

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,769
coming and I've seen a bunch of teams

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:03,370
using Trello that's very cool and and

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:05,019
and teams co-opting some Google Docs and

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,139
various other tools in interesting ways

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:11,250
so I think that's fun and I think it's

00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:14,500
really useful for us to keep evolving

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,170
practice so I'm going to share my

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,760
desktop and and hopefully we'll be able

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,840
to get a bit of a presentation on the

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,750
way I guess that means you're going to

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,449
get my view of John oh right now so John

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:34,419
Oh in stereo but if I pop over here I

00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:38,260
should be able to do that jano how's

00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:40,389
that looking looks great alright so here

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,109
we are we were about to we're in the

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:49,540
home straight for 1404 LTS now LTS is go

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:52,239
back to 2006 very first LTS was 606 the

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,349
06 was my fault because I try to wedge I

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,629
thought we should wedge a bunch more

00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:57,579
things in to make it to make it even

00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,440
better but what we've learned is that

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,560
that that predictable cadence of

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,489
releases is really really powerful so

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:12,030
we're gearing up now for 1404 LTS and

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:14,769
this is our six eight ten twelve fifty

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,799
and if you look at statistics about what

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:21,609
people are actually using in terms of an

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,039
enterprise linux very heavily that is

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,770
shifting towards ubuntu and shifting

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,750
towards the LTS releases if we look on

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,300
the clouds it's really astonishing

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,570
to see the the number of cloud servers

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,460
out there that are on an LTS release

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,440
versus the latest release of course the

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,300
fact that we we do do maintenance and

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,390
support for the interim releases is

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,720
really important because it lets people

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,700
use the legs tools if if people and use

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,430
a server platform that is aligned with

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,250
their desktops but the LTS is really a

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,010
special and the largest desktop

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,520
deployments in the world for Linux are

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,310
on our LTS releases and the and the

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,820
largest server deployments as well so i

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,490
think this cycle has been a fantastic

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,940
example of how knowing that we're doing

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,970
in LTS and focusing on the LTS ness

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,380
right the things that I really make a

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,330
difference for people who are going to

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,300
be using this platform for years and

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,380
make such a difference you can see that

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,990
in the number of people who are running

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,480
trusty today as a desktop trustee today

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,130
on the server and it really has shown

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,270
and I'd like to credit the team that's

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,820
been focused on QA for raising the state

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:41,440
of the art for free software platform QA

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,080
and the automated testing the automated

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,450
roll back the commitment that they make

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,100
to to knowing exactly where we stand on

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,160
any given day and fixing the issues that

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,630
have arisen on that day has made a huge

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,790
difference so um let's dive in we are

00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,890
delivering the best of free software the

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,150
best of all of free software you know

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,310
it's in the nature of the blue to

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,160
project that we want to be a place where

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,680
people feel they can express what is

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,770
valuable to them in free software and I

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,990
think you know in this last two year

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,390
period we've seen a real firm

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,600
reaffirming of that for example with the

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:22,420
community project so this is a ke upon

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,310
to genome project and this is a team

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,560
that stepped up to say that genome is

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,480
really important and to them and they

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,640
have the ability to do what they need to

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,740
do inside the abuja community to harness

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,750
to get the value of everything that is

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,580
being put by everybody else into a bun

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,770
to and deliver a great can own

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,630
experience on top of that the same is

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,610
true of the KDE community and it's

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,340
really important that kubuntu has can't

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,469
you'd to thrive and to strive to get

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,039
even better and the other desktop

00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:52,659
environments including of course unity

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,819
so we are shipping the best of free

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,770
software and we have now just a few

00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,960
weeks left to make sure that it really

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,060
is the best of all the free software so

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,159
the first thing is to make sure that we

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,289
are brought into the platform in some

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,650
way and everything that you guys think

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:13,180
is important for this LTS for the next

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:15,520
period from our perspective from my

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,770
perspective I think we have we've

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
created a mission of convergence layered

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,060
on top of all the goodness of ubuntu you

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,849
know we haven't stopped doing anything

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,310
that we were doing in a bun to in

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,020
support of all of the other good ways

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,029
that people use free software but we

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,250
have created in the last two years

00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,639
something pretty special on top of that

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,800
which is this unique effort to create a

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,490
convergence platform a platform that

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
spans every kind of personal computing

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,240
the way I see it today there are really

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,000
three areas that are interesting from a

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
computing perspective one is personal

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,020
computing and it's no longer just your

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,699
pc right it's your phone perhaps the

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,159
most personal computer today is your

00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:00,159
phone your tablet your pc and your

00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,110
laptop and your television our vision is

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,330
that you should be able to co-opt any

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,029
screen that you run into and use it as

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,740
your personal screen and and i think

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,539
we've made some tremendous progress in

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,300
that regard as part of the run-up to

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:16,120
1404 we will see our first tablet

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,000
releases based on 1404 so we did our

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,159
first phone release based on 13 10 of

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,849
those tablet release based on 14 f for

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,529
this convergence Mission Continues there

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,960
are a bunch of healthy benefits that

00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,300
have come from to the desktop from this

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,430
work on convergence a battery life is

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,169
better and and and we really care about

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,539
battery life so anything we can do in

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,120
the next six weeks and to improve

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,269
battery life for mobile devices of any

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,029
in any form it's really valuable really

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,470
important this work isn't just for unity

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,449
and the convergence story of course

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,370
everybody who's using in a bunch of a

00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,050
slap top doesn't matter what the

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,420
platform is doesn't matter what the GUI

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,260
looks like and is benefiting from this

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,020
focus

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,580
on mobility on personal computing the

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,410
other area that's super important of

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,150
course is the cloud and then now

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,730
Internet of Things is a really

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:12,100
interesting area as well getting ubuntu

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:15,160
on to all sorts of embedded devices in

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,400
this release and we are landing a whole

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,790
bunch of new capabilities around scopes

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,540
and scopes are the easiest way for you

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,760
to integrate content and capabilities

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,710
from the internet from the world that

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,960
you know the new world of computing

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,810
which is always connected and always

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,450
accessible to integrate those directly

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,190
into your desktop today we have two

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,140
implementations of all of this we have

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,780
the desktop implementation and then we

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,910
have the mobile a touch implementation

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,900
but those are completely converging and

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,850
the one thing we're really passionate

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,220
about is the idea that scopes you can

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,980
you can write a scope just once and then

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,270
that scope should be useful on all of

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,690
these platforms so if you're looking for

00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,570
a lightweight way to get involved or to

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,300
bring something colorful interesting to

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,670
the desktop and or to the mobile world

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,370
scopes are really the single cleanest

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,440
easiest place to start this there's a

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,060
whole bunch of different tools for

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,890
creating scopes there's a really

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,220
interesting long list of scopes that

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:21,640
have been created and that are evolving

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,500
really quickly and and and and and we're

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,270
just starting to scratch the surface I

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,160
think of what people are going to do

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,200
with scopes what's really interesting

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,430
for me about scopes is that we're really

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,980
pioneering the next wave of of of the

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,870
system interface right scopes are not an

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,600
application there really are the system

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,250
homes the home page so we're completely

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,710
transforming the way people feel about

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,120
the home screen of their phone right

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,130
instead of hunting and pecking and

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,960
finding an application you've got

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,700
everything that you want right there in

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,040
the home screen and you can get to it

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,410
really quickly lots of interesting work

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,910
being done both on the front end in the

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,030
dash itself if you if you're interested

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,340
in that climb in it's all beautiful qml

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,510
and and on the back end of course there

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,890
are tons of different ways to create

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,240
scopes you can do them in a bunch of

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,610
different languages and we're adding

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,850
ways to do that so it's very interesting

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,259
for

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,930
to work with people who want to add the

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,690
ability to create scopes and nodejs or

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,509
or other new languages which are suited

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:23,560
to this kind of lightweight and

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:25,990
integration convergence and scopes is

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,630
now real now that we have tablets as a

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,009
first class citizen and so for people

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,630
who have scopes is now really

00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,310
interesting to take them extend them

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,649
make sure that they work really well

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,300
across both the phone form factor the

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:40,899
tablet form factor and of course also

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,279
the desktop and that convergence story I

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,050
think is the most interesting thing

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,269
happening in native app development

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,279
today right how can we make it really

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,259
easy for people to create applications

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,509
which feel great in one hand if you're

00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,819
great in two hands feel great with a

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,110
keyboard and a mouse I want to thank the

00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,490
application team for the work that

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,569
they've done in this cycle for

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:04,389
celebrating what convergence is possible

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:06,009
and we're not alone in doing this if you

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,230
look at Windows 8 for example there's a

00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:11,319
lot of work happening on the proprietary

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,970
side of the software world and to make

00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:16,029
convergence possible but I think what

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,029
we've got is pretty special these apps

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,800
feel to me better than than what I see

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,269
happening on the windows front and I

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,740
think that's that's something we should

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,199
be really proud of right when there's an

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,910
important fundamental change in the way

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,730
people think about software or think

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,290
about applications and to be able to put

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,220
free software right in the front of that

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,139
is is a special opportunity and one that

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,660
I relish and it's great to see what a

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:43,529
vibrant ecosystem we have around app

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,490
developers the design team and the

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,259
community working on different core

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:53,680
applications have been super productive

00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:55,240
in this in this past six months and so

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,490
we've seen a real evolution in terms of

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,930
the scale and quantity and quality of

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,660
the applications that he getting pushed

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,040
up into the App Store and and more

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,750
interestingly i think we starting to see

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,910
second and third generation designs

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,970
we're starting to learn what works what

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,430
works best and starting to you know make

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,569
sure that we push the push the the the

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:18,430
leading edge of of possibilities and

00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:20,630
this I don't know how to do this if I

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:28,050
can stop the screen share

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:30,540
and come back there we go this phone is

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,860
feeling fantastic so those of you who

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,360
are tracking the third development i'm

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,209
running a nexus 4 i don't know what you

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,360
guys are running on but just in the last

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:42,750
in the last week and we raved yep we

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,270
raved to the new version of the colonel

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,560
and the court hardware support libraries

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:52,560
that come with the device and it is

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,050
feeling super sharp super slick super

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,480
tight I you know I'm just loving it and

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,950
we had great fun at Mobile World

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,630
Congress in Barcelona demoing the the

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,100
phone interface there and we sort of

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,110
cheated a little bit because we pre

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,209
landed it to that image a bunch of code

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,980
that isn't yet ready to ship it's all

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,080
it's all open sources or there you can

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,839
you can get it but we've got a very high

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,010
standard for quality assurance for this

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,080
device because there are people using

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,640
them as the real phone and so we didn't

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,600
want to land all of that code in this

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,130
image and for mwc so I you know I know

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,140
what's coming and I can't wait for it

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,240
but but even just the stuff that's on

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,120
here right now is feeling really really

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,250
good I had a fun experience when I was

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,649
in South Africa recently I wanted to get

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,670
a local sim so I went down to the phone

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,230
store and I can't we were going through

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,550
all the paperwork you have to give them

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,490
your ID and then you get a pay-as-you-go

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,200
sermon as the pantheon and when you mean

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,120
sort of registering it you have to get a

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,890
text message from them everything so he

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,390
asked for the phone without thinking I

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,250
gave it to him the guy popped out the

00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,350
old son put the new said men in came the

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,029
text message he checked on it wrote down

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,230
everything needed to doodle each of the

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,180
text message and gave me the phone back

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,620
and only halfway through I said

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,510
meirelles hold on this guy's never

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,420
actually seen a bet he's never seen a

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,149
book to before right and and he was just

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,560
using it and he unlocked it he got the

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,899
got the text message he did the whole

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,940
thing so yeah we know that there are

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,560
lots of glitches and shortcomings and

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,820
water and bugs and you know things that

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,630
can be improved but it's super

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,459
motivating to see and to see a bun to in

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:29,029
the wild on this really really

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:32,010
interesting important new form factor

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm loving the html5 I'm loving the web

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,579
apps

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,639
my BBC news from here and I now feel

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:42,060
pretty comfortable using Google+ on this

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,800
phone as well and it's not my only

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,389
mobile device but I'm increasingly

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,350
starting to find all the apps that i can

00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:54,970
use here rather than on something on my

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:57,279
golden k my gilded cage elsewhere so

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,709
well done to all the many teams and

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,230
people who are making that rock making

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,680
that possible and in particular the

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,079
html5 stuff is looking really sweet so

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,610
the the new browser stuff seems to be

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,550
coming along really nice performance has

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,230
improved dramatically I think that the

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,810
work that's happening on mobile feeds

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,209
directly into a browser performance for

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,760
the desktop so enhancements that are

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:25,019
really valuable I was delighted to see

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,839
the alignment shaping up around the new

00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,610
chromium chrome back-end and me r which

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,410
is going to make all of the super smooth

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,420
and be super smooth on the desktop as

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,920
well your browser of court of course is

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,449
the center of you know its most

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,550
important application and we have the

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,529
best browser in the world both of them

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,870
we have them right here as first-class

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:49,839
citizens so you know I think we have the

00:16:43,870 --> 00:17:05,740
apps that really matter let's climb back

00:16:49,839 --> 00:17:08,049
into and so creating apps is a lot of

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,000
fun the html5 story i think is is

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,910
matured nicely i think it's really

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,910
important than lucky that google

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,360
announced that html5 apps apps on

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,770
android are going to be a WebKit and

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,730
Apache Cordova and of course we've

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,900
picked WebKit and Apache Cordova and so

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,209
we should feel really good about

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,790
alignment between what we're doing and

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:34,090
what the rest of the world is using the

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,440
vast majority of fun smart phones that

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,840
are out there today are well aligned

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,970
with what we're doing on html5 but

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,290
native apps are just a lot slicker

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:46,360
quicker and and nicer and so it's really

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,420
exciting to see the

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,940
the native application ecosystem growing

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,910
as well qml is shaped up really nicely

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm excited that we've got 225 to

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,950
landing and also exciting to be getting

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,690
cute 53 and do course that the dizzier

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,840
team are doing really great stuff with

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,880
cute and with qml I feel good supporting

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,830
them and encourage you guys to support

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,170
them it's an amazing tool kit amazing

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,679
team behind it very open very easy to

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,299
work with and am cross-platform so it's

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,020
really started to be possible to write

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:24,299
native applications for 12 and Android

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,040
and other environments as well and

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:29,530
something that I'm really interested in

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,620
is the use of go as an emerging

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,120
programming language I think it is

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,220
capturing the essence of the future of

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,260
what the hardware platform looks like

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,480
which is massively concurrent lots of

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,580
things going on at the same time and and

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,299
making it possible to write native

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:49,120
applications very elegantly that that

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:50,860
take advantage of that concurrency so I

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,570
think it's the most exciting language

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,880
out there at canonical we use it very

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,440
heavily and I'm starting to spot that

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,090
you know the cool kids up there appear

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,280
to be using it heavily to and loving it

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,950
and very excited that canonical is

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,290
leading the way in integrating go and

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,610
qml so what does that mean it means that

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,910
you can start to write native

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,740
applications for one to touch that will

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,730
run on other platforms as well so we

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,450
think you'll be able to write native

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,210
applications with go and qml the front

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,730
end is as easy as as the web right it's

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,890
it's a it's like using web technologies

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,570
except it's compiled natively so it's

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,450
super fast and you've got this fantastic

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,340
new language go and at the heart of it

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,419
so those of you who have it's just a

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,900
scratch you want to learn a new language

00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:39,190
or you want to kind of be a bone up on

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:42,520
the stuff that seems to be really moving

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,040
at pace go check out go and go check out

00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,400
the go qml integration and there'll be

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,630
an app contest for the NGO community in

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,580
the next couple of weeks i think that's

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,190
underway and that'll be a fun way to

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,220
kind of stretch your programming legs in

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,440
new and really interesting ways but

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,879
overall the app story the

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,500
a bunch we have story is really

00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:06,429
interesting so whatever you like whether

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,679
it's html5 C++ to your milk go give it a

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,629
go and thank you very much to everybody

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,429
who's climbed in and help meet this

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:17,710
tooling better in the last six months

00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:19,269
now the LTS stands for long-term support

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,529
and we mean it I've been delighted in

00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:23,409
the last couple of weeks they've been a

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:26,049
series of threads with the tech board

00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:31,000
and various leads of the different

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:34,389
communities edgy 12 xubuntu Ubuntu and

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,789
so on making making clear what they want

00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:39,100
to do in terms of LTS commitments for

00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:41,860
those communities under the big of

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,389
little umbrella big things that are

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,480
really strong stories now we have

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:49,120
hardware enable met revisions right what

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,480
that means is that every six months and

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,909
we're going to push out a new or support

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,409
for new hardware into a bun too and it's

00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,629
really important that all of our desktop

00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:01,120
environments track that and work across

00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:04,240
that new hardware so every six months we

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,370
will introduce optional new kernels and

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,070
graphics tax for the latest hardware

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,360
support for all of our environments so

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,639
those of you who are working on

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,860
different desktops please make sure that

00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:16,240
you have a plan to support the latest

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,919
hardware with your environment you'll

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,559
get much more users your users will be

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,450
happier and we're doing all of the grunt

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,279
work essentially in certifying and

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,779
testing the kernel and graphic stack and

00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,419
X and everything else that goes into

00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:29,590
that new hardware support it's a roll-up

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,009
of all the work that we're doing with

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,960
Dell and HP and asus and lenovo and so

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:37,570
on all of their PCs it's really valuable

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,100
work and really important for our users

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,200
that you know if you want them to use a

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,570
desktop environment that they're able to

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,190
use that with their latest hardware now

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,919
we're making a five-year maintenance

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,519
commitment to 240 know for for the for

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,039
the desktop longer for the assembly

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,409
that's the case and with that comes

00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,320
policies around stable release updates

00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:03,580
and main inclusion reports so please

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,960
dive in to that and dig in and make the

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,780
most of it

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:14,700
right so that's the personal computing

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,920
side of ubuntu but and we're also an

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,980
anchor for people who are doing really

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,250
really interesting stuff on the cloud

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:27,090
and so I think it's really important now

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,280
is we have the final run up to 240 know

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,710
for that those of you who have a couple

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,900
of PCs knocking around that support

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,180
virtualization go ahead and build

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,070
OpenStack clouds and now we're going to

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,350
is the reference platform for OpenStack

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,880
development most of the people who are

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,830
contributing to OpenStack of doing it

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,600
around a bun to we put a huge amount of

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,850
work into making that as easy as

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,830
possible integrating and packaging and

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,530
delivering all of the latest stuff and

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,530
doing continuous integration of the

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,620
latest OpenStack stuff on ubuntu we are

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:03,440
committing that on this 1404 LTS we will

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:07,050
deliver ice house and Juno and K and L

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,030
on 1404 so that people can always use

00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,890
1404 with the latest version of

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,010
OpenStack which i think is really really

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,960
important and but the more people we

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:19,500
have kicking the tires building clouds

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,960
giving us feedback and exercising all of

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,030
this the data there are some very large

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,770
a bunch of weapons at clouds built or

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,510
being built it's very exciting behind

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,160
the scenes and I get a little bit of a

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,320
peek occasionally into some of them and

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,060
it makes me very proud to see the

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,270
biggest clouds the biggest companies

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,400
building great clouds on a bun to an on

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:41,220
OpenStack and we can only do that

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,780
because we we have such a wide community

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,970
of people who are exercising the

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,010
platform on different hardware and

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,770
feedback before the release is so much

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,020
easier to to respond to than feedback

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,540
after the release so there's this this

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,600
month of window of opportunity left to

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,990
really polish and everything up for for

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,850
this release let's let's make it a a

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:06,860
cracking cracking good one and as

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,140
opposed to an easy one to crack and

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,090
and then looking looking further afield

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,880
the question is okay so OpenStack gives

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,980
us this distributed Linux experience

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,770
that's distributed of wood to experience

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,620
what do things look like on top of that

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,410
and I think we're onto something really

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,210
meaningful with juju just in the last

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,830
couple of months there's been some

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,570
really interesting companies stepping up

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,240
and saying all this is really useful and

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,130
they want to contribute to juju but what

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,620
really matters is all the things that

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:41,090
people can do and so the way juju works

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:43,190
is that we have charms which distill all

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,740
the operational stuff that you have to

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,049
do to make Hadoop work or my sequel work

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,990
or set work or rabbit work and those

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,419
charms think of them as like packages

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,610
for the cloud they they handle the

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,530
installation of software across multiple

00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,299
machines they handle configuration of

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,090
that software across multiple machines

00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:04,870
they handle connecting up and updating

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,160
that software across multiple machines

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,110
they're a layer above configuration

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,780
management so they can include things

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,400
like chef or puppet to help them do

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,290
configuration management that's a good

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,419
way to do it if you if you know chef and

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,970
puppet and but they're a layer up in

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:22,490
terms of abstracting for the user the

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,320
way they want to think about integrating

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,000
all of the different pieces in there in

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,059
their application of this solution and

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,559
they've been a bunch of really nice

00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:33,860
movements forward in juju just in the

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
last couple of months the first and my

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,570
favorite is the creation of bundles and

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:45,440
so if you can demo this if you go to

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:49,160
juju charms calm and this is this is my

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,990
canvas I can I can drag and drop

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,700
different pieces of software on there so

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,250
you know the classic example is I can

00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,070
take my sequel and put it in and then I

00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,200
can take WordPress and deploy that just

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,570
using the defaults and then I can

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,610
connect these up while on I've got a

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,110
blog my sequel talking bird person

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,320
that's all up and running on the cloud

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:15,410
which is really really nice but say I

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:18,380
wanted to say I wanted to get a whole

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:21,170
bunch of things going and

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,520
then I can get a bundle which is a

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:29,090
preconfigured a whole set of things and

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:31,760
I can zoom out a little bit and all of

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,890
those things have now been sent to the

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,930
cloud spun up configured in multiple

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:39,620
units integrated and all of that's

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:42,650
happening and live real-time on pretty

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,910
much any cloud that matters so this is

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,740
really interesting because it allows

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,600
people to collaborate at a much higher

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,460
level right now suddenly we can

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,080
collaborate around instead of

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,490
collaborating around individual pieces

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,480
of software we can collaborate around

00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,700
organizations of software you know

00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,960
clusters of software bringing pieces of

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,150
software together to do useful things

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,090
it's really interesting to watch teams

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,620
of system administrators and having

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,940
conversations around this right because

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,400
it allows them to express different

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,260
ideas about what would work well what

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,490
works better different configurations

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:19,340
permutations combinations and so on so a

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,710
lot of fun to be had with juju and key

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,810
areas to contribute and because this is

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,720
an LTS we've got a bunch of charms that

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:29,630
are all around 1204 it's time to start

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,540
and porting those charms forward to 1404

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,580
so we can exercise them with trusty make

00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,300
sure that they work and really well with

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,520
trustee and also new stuff being charmed

00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,640
up and a bunch of new things just landed

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,950
and and but it's a huge world out there

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,140
and there's tons of stuff and still to

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,610
be done also areas that are interesting

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,940
in juju itself would get a lot of

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:54,770
requests for support for CentOS red hat

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,190
fedora and so on we'd love to take

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,500
patches for that and so if you span the

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,750
Abboud to world and those worlds then

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,120
that's an area where you can make a

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,680
meaningful contribution and but mainly I

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,510
think climbing in on finding a piece of

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,880
software that you use everyday on the

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,580
cloud or on servers especially if it's

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,770
kind of scale out oriented and finding

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,390
the charm for that and and enhancing it

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,540
or testing if you're kicking kicking the

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:26,060
tires on it in one way or another um

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:28,850
right I think that's just about a wrap

00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,430
for me that gives us a good stretch of

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,220
time for questions and answers

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:39,830
I hope you're all enjoying UDS very much

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:43,250
and I'm happy too I'm happy to take your

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,530
questions Johnny okay so before we've

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,850
already got we've got a good good

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,470
collection of questions already as you

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,390
were speaking mark so for those of you

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,040
who want to ask a question here's how

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,440
you do type the word question in capital

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,940
letters a case into the into the IRC

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,100
chat channel which is beneath the video

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,270
feed and then I'm going to go through

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,890
and add them to the list and we're

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,860
basically going to get to as many as we

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,570
can in 30 minutes so get your questions

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,440
in and we'll go through them so the

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,480
first one is from spider 63 who asks

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:17,360
when is mere expected to hit officially

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,370
as the displacer so I expect mere to be

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,030
the display server as soon as it's rock

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:26,000
solid and and we have a story that we're

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:28,940
really proud of on it it is officially

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,440
the display server right here right and

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,620
it's officially the display server on

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,290
our tablet and you can run it on your

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,690
desktop and but we don't want to make

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,940
you know we don't want to let a love of

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,390
Technology interfere with our mission to

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,730
be great for the user and this is a

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:50,000
great place for us to set the bar very

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,890
high in terms of performance where we

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,320
have you know freedom to get it right

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:58,130
and rather than worrying too much about

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,170
compatibility and my expectation is that

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,880
within the next 12 months you'll see

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,570
lots of people running their as their

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,240
default display server and by 1604 it

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,070
will be the default display server and

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,780
there's lots of reasons why you know

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,110
that will let us support more Hardware

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,490
let us get much better performance and

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,290
let us do great things with some of the

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,330
software companies that we care about

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,830
who are really you know they want to

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,950
squeeze every bit of performance out of

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,360
the the hardware that you've got and so

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,580
that's the kind of timeline that we're

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,630
looking at well it's an amazing team by

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,350
the way if you want to climb into that

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,290
it's great to see a hard problems

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,240
getting solved very cleanly and a total

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,920
focus on performance and quality you

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,570
know if there's a lot of stuff gets

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,160
written as open source that's you know

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,299
moves very fast it's all very exciting

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,369
that it's a bit ropey around the

00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,869
and this is a team that really knows

00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:51,450
their stuff and is is doing great

00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:53,610
quality work i'm proud to be some point

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,070
doing a lot of rigor built into that

00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,509
into that process so this is obviously

00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,639
the place where people can ask the

00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,489
burning and essential and important

00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:06,149
questions kraken all brings one of those

00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:08,610
mark what's up with the beard so you

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:10,499
know you know it's super fashionable

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:16,110
occasionally you know I'm a slave to

00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:17,789
fashion I noticed that cavemen were

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,789
proliferating and I thought you know

00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:22,440
since I can't grow this hair quite as as

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,350
well as I used to I'm ezell gross

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,080
another here I like playing with I like

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,580
playing with my hair for some other

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,399
reason you know that there was the

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,049
there's some some article somewhere that

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,119
has a collection of pictures me with

00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:38,639
different dumb hairstyles this is not

00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,759
the dumbest hairstyle I've ever had and

00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:44,789
again I think it's really quite you know

00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,340
fashionable in a in a robustly masculine

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:49,799
kind of way and I was in Germany just

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,059
yesterday at ceva it was great and I was

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,649
going to tell the joke about knowing

00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:55,559
that the Germans you know our super

00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:56,759
super precise super clean shaven and so

00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,169
I got up really early in the morning

00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,909
because I had to fly to Germany and I'd

00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,129
shape but I'd missed a spot but I

00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:04,429
thought him that probably wasn't the

00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:07,409
right joke to be telling at sea bird

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,330
there's a slightly serious angle to the

00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:13,909
beard though and one of my colleagues at

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:17,039
canonical was stopped and held by

00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:19,499
Transport Police who not real police in

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,590
the UK and was held for hours many hours

00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:27,059
and questioned and you know there was no

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:29,489
reason or justification or probable

00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,809
cause for that whatsoever and as he was

00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,129
leaving he said to them camera guys what

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,799
was this about and one of them said to

00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:37,109
him it was the beard and I think that's

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,080
disgusting right you might have a

00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:43,649
civilized society that judges people by

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,299
how they look and and so you know it's

00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:47,429
part of me hopes that a goon will try it

00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:50,940
on with me and the other part of me just

00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:53,009
likes being manly you know and I don't

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,659
get the opportunity very often Ryan

00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:56,730
what's next that is the quote that's

00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,549
going to be published ok next one is

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,279
from funky glad

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:03,820
we've recently seen a nice new

00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:05,499
lockscreen added to 1404 will they with

00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,820
well the long needed quality finishes

00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:11,169
find a way into unity 8 from the start

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,169
sure I think the new lock screen is

00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:17,499
beautiful work and it's a lot easier for

00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:22,029
us to move fast on unity eight because

00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:23,799
qml is super productive and with lots of

00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:26,080
contributors helping make that you know

00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:29,320
go fast and we don't have a legacy story

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,999
to worry about nearly as much and so you

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,840
know if you if you have an image today I

00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:37,600
think you appreciate how much goes into

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,100
daily quality on this image and also how

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,710
much thought is going into the design of

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,539
each piece so I guess the short answer

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,029
is yes and I'm really glad that you

00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:48,700
liked the lock screen I like it too

00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:50,679
excellent next question is from Geddy is

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,190
there still interest in exploring the

00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,960
rolling release idea well so this is

00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,129
very very interesting yes I think if you

00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,869
look at these images they are

00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:01,629
effectively rolling releases right you

00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:05,019
get a new update and you know any time

00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:08,109
it passes QA what's great about that is

00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:11,589
that you get a new update every time it

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:13,419
passes QA and and so you've got all the

00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,250
freshness of a rolling release but you

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:18,190
don't have the friction associated with

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,500
individual binary binary package updates

00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,940
and the system is either good in which

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,730
case it's good for everybody and it

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,859
ships or it's not in which case you know

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,109
it doesn't and I think that's an amazing

00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,270
amazing new way of thinking about

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:33,669
desktop linux right that the whole

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,950
platform updates for everybody on this

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:37,720
on this ratchet and just gets better and

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,490
better and better we can all we can

00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,520
debug things more easily we can share

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:44,109
problems more easily we can weaken

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,240
things are more repeatable and I think

00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,470
it's a very powerful new tool and I

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,730
think we're going to take that to the

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,530
server as well you know would it be

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,079
interesting if you could apply our

00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,639
server and instead of doing package

00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:56,530
updates you literally did a system image

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,450
update and you could toggle between them

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,339
and I think that would be super

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,290
interesting super powerful so I think

00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,180
it's the beginning of a brave new world

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,220
in terms of how we deliver software

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,780
write applications in containers if

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
you've heard of darker all the

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,440
excitement around dhaka that's exactly

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,510
what they're doing

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,829
of course that was pioneered on ubuntu

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,829
works brilliantly honorable into motion

00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:18,300
docker images are honorable into and but

00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:20,040
we've got exactly the same thing going

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,240
on here and we should have the same

00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,900
thing for your desktop that would be

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,780
amazing next question is from schnook

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,349
who asks what's canonical need to do to

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,349
be successful in the mass market hmm

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:37,589
well my sense for that is that it's not

00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:39,720
enough to be you know a nice to the

00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:43,710
deliverer of the world's free software

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,530
we have to lead an important area that

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,470
people will care about and for me that's

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,910
convergence right we have to be the at

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,440
the forefront of something that people

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:56,250
decide it turns out to be really

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,260
valuable and I think convergence is it

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,300
right I think that the idea that you

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,770
could have one personal computer maybe

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,030
that ultimately is something that's in

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,589
your pocket you never take it out of

00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,359
your pocket what'd you take out is just

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:09,119
a piece of glass with microphone right

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,740
which is your which is your phone and

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,900
when you use a tablet it's just another

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,940
piece of glass but the brain of all of

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,369
that is what's in your pocket it's your

00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,780
most personal computer now to do that to

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:21,480
do that kind of really deep

00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,310
forward-looking stuff takes years and it

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,710
takes deep commitment and it takes more

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,359
people than one company can can can hire

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,430
in this day and age that's why I'm so

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,410
appreciative of all the people who've

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,390
join in to help make unity a success

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:37,050
right it's not that it's not that we

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,119
have anything against KDE organ ohm or X

00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,980
fce or LXE we celebrate those things

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,329
right we do a lot to make room for them

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,770
and for those communities to be able to

00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:45,990
benefit from everything that we put into

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,960
the core platform but we really want to

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,670
lead something important and new and to

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,630
me that's convergence I'm super excited

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,089
increasingly there are all sorts of

00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,490
signs around the internet that maybe

00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:02,040
this is actually the key idea right look

00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:05,040
at the look at the asus transformer and

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,020
and the PadFone and how those are really

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,550
moving and refining attorney interesting

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,500
products the problem is the software's

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:13,079
terrible but we've got beautiful

00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,720
software to go with that amazing and

00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,119
interesting hardware and and then on top

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,369
of that look at look at what we're doing

00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,170
in the cloud where again it's not enough

00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:23,710
for us to go out there and deliver a

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,200
UNIX you know a UNIX

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,490
cheap eunuchs that's great other people

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,830
have done that that's not our mission

00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,660
our mission is to make everything easy

00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,869
right just like we did it on the desktop

00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,460
and it's not enough to go and and just

00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,230
be there and be free you have to

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,359
suddenly make it dramatically easier for

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,800
people to get amazing things done that's

00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:43,420
why I'm so excited about juju on the

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,580
card because it's for me it's like that

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,290
first year of a bun to win all the stuff

00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,210
that used to be really hard is now

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,849
suddenly really easy and you see people

00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,470
unleash their talent just you know

00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,540
unleashed as they're able to get the

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,580
Gipper the grungy stuff done easily and

00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,349
then they get the fun stuff on top of

00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,760
that so those are the things that are

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,640
important to me that's what I think we

00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,619
have to do to be successful and you know

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,880
kicking and screaming there are 600 of

00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,180
us that are passionate about that

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,220
feature absolutely Josh strobel has the

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,349
next question which is will there be any

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,570
commitments to an improved ubuntu one

00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:20,260
client across a bun to ubuntu for

00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:24,670
smartphones android etc in future cycles

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,680
possibly 14 10 or 15 for ubuntu one is

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,089
really challenging you know the vision I

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,000
think was exactly right but our

00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:32,230
execution of it was not great and and so

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,359
I think there are pieces of that that

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,940
that remain very very important the idea

00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,130
that we can essentially enable people to

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,290
hook so glue services together around a

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,910
common identity is really important and

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,730
you'll see that in here right there's a

00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:48,820
you you can use ubuntu one as your

00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:51,160
identity you can provide other you know

00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,290
credentials for other identity services

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,750
as well but a bun to one is there as the

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,550
default for everybody and I think there

00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,080
are elements of ubuntu one where i would

00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,570
love us to be better like I'm file

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,280
sharing and so on where we aren't as

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,109
good as I would like us to be but it

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,510
can't be our focus right now because we

00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:10,570
can only focus on a couple of key areas

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,130
and contributions welcome otherwise you

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,020
know there are great choices there that

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,760
do work on a bun to dropbox works on a

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,530
bun to and others work on a bun to as

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,570
well and we should celebrate that be

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,070
glad that they care about object for

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,700
give them reasons to care about our

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:26,140
platform absolutely with a couple of

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,970
people have expressed an interest in

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:32,410
icons both springbank and benny bolivar

00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:34,690
they fight crime are asking similar

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,470
questions which is what's going on with

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:40,820
the icon theme and can we expect

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:42,770
new icons the land and 1404 I I can't

00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,619
speak to the timing of new icons I did

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:48,200
see a package show up in updates just

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:50,540
today or yesterday called and they blew

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,480
two tsuru icon theme that may have been

00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,250
these icons here for the desktop I'm not

00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,869
exactly sure i'm a bit embarrassed that

00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,090
I don't know everything that's happening

00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:01,369
is a giant project I can tell you that

00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:04,520
that commitment is and there's a lot of

00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:06,800
work on into building a new icon theme

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,530
which is super professional super open

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,830
super beautiful and those of you who are

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,960
tracking the to James work and on the

00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,030
sewer icons the feedback that I've seen

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,130
is just astonished I want to print those

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,950
things out as giant art for my for my

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,170
living room it is they are they're just

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:27,020
gorgeous and they're also really

00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,540
distinctive without being kind of say me

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,170
right the the thing that makes them

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:35,840
hours and you know it's kind of subtle

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,670
and so they get to be theirs while still

00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,020
being part of the collection and I think

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,780
that's you know what is pulled off there

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,930
is is masterful and so I'm super excited

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:47,270
about that and I would support those

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,099
being available on 1404 for the desktop

00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,260
for anybody who wants them I don't know

00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:52,760
what it takes to do that I don't know

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,490
who's responsible for that I don't know

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,020
if it's possible but I know that the

00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,310
impossible sometimes seems possible if

00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,930
someone said to their mind to it so if

00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,060
you can either do that or inspire

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,710
someone to do that then it may well

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,300
happen so I add a little bit of a

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,800
question on the side I checked in with

00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,940
jason warner who was the engineering

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,859
manager for the desktop team yesterday

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,869
and asked him about this and he said

00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,030
that the design the designers are

00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,800
through most of the icons but not not

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,710
enough to feel comfortable but lining

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,900
them in 1404 so the working hard but

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,550
we're not expected until and enforcing

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,740
therefore but obviously on on the on the

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,880
touch devices will they be there as an

00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,880
option will they be a package that

00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,220
people can install I don't believe so

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,960
i'm not sure Jason's trying to drill

00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,890
down to the specifics right now sir all

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,180
right as well if someone wants to

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,130
package a map go for it they're there

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,550
they're available could be fantastic

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,720
they look beautiful mm so spider 63 ask

00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,820
the question that a few people in the

00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,980
channel were intrigued by asking what

00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,750
about 22 inch sony tablets are they

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,760
going to display as a normal pc i don't

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,680
think i've ever seen a 22 inch tablet

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,330
or seems like a big tablet to me and

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,270
yeah the sort of the monster family

00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:01,640
tablet thing there's this they're super

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,110
interesting and I don't see why we

00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,680
wouldn't work right out of the box on

00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:08,690
them and you know I suspect that they

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,450
all of the back end touch driver stuff

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,430
is pretty standard now I'm pretty sure

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:17,200
we would work and right out of the box

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:20,870
and I can't can't wait to test one I'm

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,090
upgraded my Sputnik to the new dell XPS

00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,370
15 which is a 15 inch monitor with the

00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,690
touch screen and I've explicitly done

00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:29,960
that because I want to be running unity

00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:32,210
8 on my laptop and on the touchscreen

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,650
even though you know a lot of the

00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,540
applications that I love and care about

00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:41,750
are going to be horribly broken in their

00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:43,340
configuration initially and so I don't

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,580
see any reason why it wont way they

00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,560
wouldn't work really really well

00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:51,080
fantastic next question is from Spring

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,360
Bank this is a pretty apropos question

00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,160
given some of your recent post mark will

00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:10,610
a bun to be available for the nexus 7

00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:14,000
2013 oh hell yeah so let me just the

00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,050
short answer is yes and super excited

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,930
about it seems to perform really

00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:21,620
beautifully I just I just flashed this

00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:24,380
one today and it came straight up no

00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:27,310
issues and there was one glitch in the

00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,080
docks where to get it into the recovery

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:32,390
you know the bootloader image situation

00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,370
you you fired up once you've made it a

00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,580
developer android laptop you fired up in

00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,230
them from the from the a bunch of

00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,450
command line you say adb reboot

00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,550
bootloader and then you do the normal

00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,720
buncha device flash story and it just

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,600
came up so I guess that team has

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,340
promoted this device into the officially

00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,410
supported category now and comes up

00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,750
really nicely well it still thinks it's

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,360
it still thinks it's a phone but that

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,850
will change very soon yeah I'm using it

00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,380
as well it's working great next question

00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,269
is from Mike

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:09,440
all what's plan for a bun to for

00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:11,839
smartphones in Europe so we've got to

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,029
launch partners one is in Europe and one

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,769
is in China both of them are companies

00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:17,539
that have demonstrated that they can

00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:19,609
come in to kind of congested crowded

00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:21,950
markets and claw their way in and

00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:23,809
deliver interesting devices into the

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:27,079
right people's hands in Europe the

00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:28,519
company's called BQ and they're they're

00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,390
really interesting there I think they're

00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:31,220
going to become the first new

00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,960
manufacturer of firms within

00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,369
manufacturing in Europe right the

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,440
currently store manufacturer in china

00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,180
but they're really small company they

00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,490
attack things in a very interesting way

00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,470
and and that's what I liked about them

00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,990
that's why we picked them as a European

00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:48,200
launch partner so they'll be they'll be

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:49,490
marketing some devices the really

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,170
interesting stuff that they do is dual

00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,609
sim which is useful I don't know about

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,710
for you guys but it's super useful for

00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:58,309
me traveling a lot it's nice to have my

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,930
global sim and my local sim and and and

00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:02,329
so there'll be a they'll be do they'll

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:06,289
be doing dual some devices here in

00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:08,599
Europe and then in China meizu same sort

00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:11,119
of story very scrappy new feisty company

00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:13,430
young company that that's broken up and

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,920
shipped a lot of funds over the last two

00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:19,759
years they're excited about a good to as

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,650
a wii and they're there they'll be

00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:23,420
focused on the chinese market but then

00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:28,069
also those phones may well move into

00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:30,859
europe and the US as well next question

00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:32,089
is from michael hall who was who asks

00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,799
you know you've been using the ability

00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,329
phone what's your favorite apps so fine

00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:36,109
if you don't use it on a daily basis

00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:38,750
what's the one you've been most

00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:40,940
impressed with so far so that the thing

00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,259
i spend most time on is su doku but i

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,170
got like a long list of design

00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:47,180
enhancements for that honey so i need to

00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,369
figure out who's the genius behind it

00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:52,220
because i'd like to spend some time with

00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:56,210
them and see if I can inspire them to be

00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:58,910
more but I you know so I it's now my

00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,890
official sodoku machine and I'm getting

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:04,220
BBC news on it so I think that's a PO p

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,869
web app and a favorite google+ so I wake

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:12,410
up to a bunch of phone and google plus

00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:14,630
and on it over there and and I i use the

00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,039
Settings app quite a lot for updates so

00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,760
I look for my presence from did rocks

00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,460
and

00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,250
every day and lift me have a look

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,170
asteroid rocks what's what's running now

00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,490
and then I like the gallery I think the

00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,400
gallery is really quite beautiful the

00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:31,670
way to come together fantastic fantastic

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,800
next question is from arcane and he

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,620
plans to get Vodafone on board and

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,390
shipping ubuntu for that for that so I

00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,250
believe Vodafone have announced their

00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,190
membership in our carrier advisory group

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:47,510
if they haven't then I just did and they

00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:50,180
sure they um that's the wrong way to

00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:54,350
make an announcement followed shortly by

00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,400
an apology the you know they've signed

00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,570
up because they think what we're doing

00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,730
is really interesting and they want

00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:00,230
publicly to to express that interest so

00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:03,680
that manufacturers will come and talk to

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,420
them about their plans and you know we

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,600
want to be really tactical about how we

00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:11,860
launched these devices when the first

00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:15,020
ones ship are going to be amazing for

00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,130
some things and they'll be okay for some

00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,540
things and they'll be bad for some

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,040
things and that's just reality right

00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,480
that's not because we've done a bad job

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,580
because we made terrible mistakes

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,900
because of bad programmers you know

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,550
because we got a terrible community

00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,890
that's not it at all it's just because

00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,650
you know it's a one auto and are a

00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,060
collection will be what it is and you

00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,500
know there'll be things that we don't

00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,740
get to that we want to get to and that's

00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,270
okay so what really matters is that the

00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,830
phones would ship go into the hands of

00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,330
people who will be passionate about the

00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,220
things that we're really amazing at

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,660
right because that way they'll be happy

00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:48,080
they'll help us make the other things

00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:50,360
better and so we don't want to do a mass

00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,690
go into every store in Europe kind of

00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,850
launched in 2014 and this conversation

00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,790
is what John are reported as you wrote

00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:00,860
super into phones in 2014 sorry what was

00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:03,110
misreported as Jonas and you weren't

00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:05,210
have opened two phones in 2014 the

00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,710
reality is just that we will be very

00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,600
tactical about the launch will put them

00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,310
into as many hands as we can as long as

00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,520
we can be really confident those people

00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,750
are going to love the device so and we

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,100
don't actually want to have a carrier

00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,750
that goes out and says all of their

00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,250
users regardless of who they are and all

00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,170
of these tools should just start you

00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,340
know buying a bunch of phones because we

00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,500
think then a bunch of the people would

00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,850
go and then find that it find the bits

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,480
where it's not great and be upset about

00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,030
that so our strategy is get get great

00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,650
phone

00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,330
into the hands of people who going to

00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,400
love the things that are amazing about

00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,580
them while we make everything else

00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,770
amazing too so that in 2015 you can

00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,530
expect to see them in every store from

00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,120
every carrier now we have 16 carriers

00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,740
announced and more that I'm not

00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,050
announced right that are working with us

00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,210
that is pretty much everybody that

00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,520
matches right really be pretty much

00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,470
everybody that matches what has got our

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,750
back on this wants just to succeed so I

00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:00,420
don't worry about carrier support right

00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,150
what I worry about now is is helping

00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,980
developers make great apps so our design

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,990
story in the communication to developers

00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,610
making it easy for those developers to

00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,790
bring apps from different environments

00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:15,840
to a good too and so you know again a

00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:17,400
developer story and and then making sure

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,800
that the phones that we launch go to

00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,000
happy homes right and people who'll be

00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,310
passionate about them who blog about

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,330
them will show their friends we do this

00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:29,880
very cool little test we bring people in

00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,850
off the street and give them a shower

00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,040
now we you know we give them and some

00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,360
phones to play with and one of the

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,630
phones that will give them looks like

00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,100
this and we ask some questions about it

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,480
and get them to do things you know its

00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,760
standard user testing things but we

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,310
observe one thing that I think is very

00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,050
interesting which is when they sit down

00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,900
with other people whether they put the

00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:53,790
phone you know where they put the phone

00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,800
out where people can see it or whether

00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,020
they hold the phone back where people

00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,480
can't see it and you know what we win

00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,450
that test every time people want to show

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,400
this off and I think that's fantastic

00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,870
right so we've got to put these phones

00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,790
into the hands of people who want to

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,680
show them off right we will go into a

00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,500
bar and say check this out mate can your

00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,930
phone do this and there's tons of things

00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,370
that we can do that other people haven't

00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,510
thought of all that we do just better

00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,670
than other people and we want to

00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,710
celebrate that in that first launch

00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:25,050
period so that's why we're taking this

00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,350
very tactical approach very gorilla

00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:31,310
approach to to the launch that's the

00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:34,280
next question is from steam for Linux

00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:37,290
who asks as we move forward to

00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,000
introducing unity 8 on the desktop how

00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,620
are we working to ensure that it's

00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,990
implemented the right way and the way

00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,069
that we wanted so it's hike

00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,809
well the first is we're building on very

00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:48,250
good quality foundations right this was

00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:50,529
a tough decision that we said we would

00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,210
focus on quality all the way down stack

00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:54,039
if we had a ropey part somewhere in the

00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,529
stack then it was going to affect our

00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:58,089
quality inn in bad ways so tough

00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:59,740
decision that we made the commitment and

00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:01,839
I'm glad that we have to go all the way

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,569
down we we can lead the quality story

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,400
all the way down and the other thing is

00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:08,440
that we deferred the piece that is in a

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,109
sense the hardest but also in the sense

00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,089
the least important right which is the

00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,700
desktop window management piece right

00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:18,039
because desktop window management is a

00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,769
solved problem we all know what window

00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,180
management looks like and feels like so

00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,819
we're deferring that problem we have

00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,950
good window managers on X right now we

00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:29,170
will slip mirror in underneath X and

00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,750
then we will essentially replace the

00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,819
window manager and hopefully for lots of

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:36,430
people that will be a non-event now

00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:39,130
there will be an interim stage there be

00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:42,099
an interim stage where it's possible to

00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:44,680
run desktop applications in a tablet

00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,990
environment and that is going to be kind

00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,250
of cool but kind of sucky because what

00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,920
will happen is that you'll think about

00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,660
it think about it as as as you know

00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,119
you'll have every desktop application in

00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,500
its own workspace and that way we can

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,059
treat them all as kind of full screen

00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,430
and we don't have to do window

00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,500
management on them but you can still use

00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,940
the desktop applications and they don't

00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,700
have to be they don't have to be touch

00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,259
applications and so we're you know we're

00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,789
furiously trying to figure out what the

00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:11,170
best way is to do that I if you're

00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,490
interested the mere team would love to

00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,339
hear from you they will be leading this

00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:16,869
work and it should be fun work and we're

00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:18,759
really trying to raise the state of the

00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:20,890
art and so even though window management

00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:22,450
is a sort of solve problem we don't

00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,130
wanna bring another crappy window

00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:26,859
manager to the table with all of the

00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,410
years of baggage of unix and linux and

00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:31,329
you know x so we're really trying to do

00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:33,130
something crisp and clean and sharp and

00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:35,890
there'll be plenty of opportunities to

00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:38,799
engage and and and make it you know

00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,589
really fly for you fantastic and we're

00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:43,450
so close to having the unity a preview

00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:45,250
session which will look like the tablet

00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,039
on in trustee as well some people will

00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,450
be able to play that very soon next

00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,009
question from Cracknell any plans to

00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,630
reintroduce the bloody certifications

00:52:51,009 --> 00:52:54,410
and particularly interested in the area

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,289
of cloud computing

00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:59,420
and so I heard as much as crap tool and

00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:01,970
then you crack crack good sign I think

00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,470
all the way okay I'll repeat that and he

00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,270
plans to reintroduce the bunty's of

00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:08,900
certifications I'm especially interested

00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:11,690
in the area of cloud computing yes

00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:14,299
that's that's a super interesting idea

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,400
and we are looking at having an a good

00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:19,490
to cloud training course and

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,220
certification and if you would ping me

00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:24,410
privately I'm just sa bbfl on on

00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,880
freenode and I'd love to chat about that

00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,339
understand where you are what the best

00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,420
way to deliver it to you would be

00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:33,319
definitely feels like something we

00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,670
should be able to do for you next

00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:36,980
question is from V Thompson which

00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:39,799
language either straight qml or go

00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,420
besides html5 do we expect I'll hope to

00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:47,750
be the easiest to port to other devices

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:49,520
such as Android and iOS and go qml next

00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,510
question is from who me I've seen that

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,819
someone was working on adding

00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:55,190
digitalocean supported use you is this

00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:58,190
is that going to be mainlined at some

00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:00,829
point yeah for sure so digitalocean is a

00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:03,589
fantastic cloud provider it's great to

00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:05,420
support them and what what juju has a

00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:07,700
plug-in mechanism really it's kind of

00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,170
like a shell shell out hook so you can

00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,200
write a collection of shell scripts that

00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:16,730
will implement a juju command and and

00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:18,559
and so there is no ocean and it's not

00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,299
ideal if you you know ideal would be to

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,069
have a full juju provider so that you

00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:25,369
too can natively drive digital ocean

00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:27,319
with all of its api's but it's of

00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:30,589
smoothes the process of using juju with

00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:35,599
digital ocean and a contributions

00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:37,670
welcome on the yeah i think that plugin

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,549
is widely available and easy to get so

00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:41,930
get cracking next question is from

00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:43,940
michael hall because i've been curious

00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:48,170
for a while what's the story behind your

00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:53,000
dragon avatar hi so when i started when

00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:55,700
i finished with thought and verisign and

00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,960
a small guys of a team of guys who

00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:02,569
worked with me there wanted to fund them

00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,029
and we went through the process of kind

00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:07,339
of bootstrapping that and they got in a

00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:08,120
guy to design the logo and one day that

00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,290
guy came in

00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,060
you know we were going through the logo

00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,770
design process and he and he had a piece

00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,830
of paper with him and he said here I did

00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,270
something just for you Anna was this

00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:20,090
little dragon which i think is brilliant

00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:21,770
you know a happy dragon and and for

00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:25,940
whatever reason I've just adopted that

00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:30,950
as as my mascot and so we call him norm

00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:33,290
norm is on my plane and is on you know

00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:36,230
is the avatar that i use all over and

00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:40,930
he's just a happy kind of guy but he is

00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:43,340
a dragon you know so norm the dragon

00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:46,910
arcane any chance of a further attempts

00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:48,800
at lead one to hedge man i was

00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:53,300
disappointed that we didn't get to make

00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,830
that device and the more the more work

00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,160
we put into it the more i fell in love

00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:59,840
with with what it could be and it's

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,610
interesting to see how many of the ideas

00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,610
we expressed in the edge are now showing

00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:06,740
up in kind of more mainstream efforts

00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,200
Apple has bought out you know two years

00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:11,090
worth of sapphire glass from the company

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,630
that we were planning to work with in

00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:16,100
the edge and but more interestingly

00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:18,110
Samsung and various others have said

00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,970
that it was it was really eye-opening to

00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:23,180
them and it's given them potentially a

00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:25,520
reason to raise the bar on on the sorts

00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:28,070
of devices they plan so we're seeing

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,590
that kind of spec of ram and cpu

00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,360
performance be bandied about as real

00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:35,030
devices that other people might make i

00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,920
don't think we have to make it because

00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,750
there are lots of companies that that

00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,030
are great and making hardware we needed

00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:43,340
to inspire someone to make it what we

00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:45,170
have to make is the convergence software

00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:47,300
and so in a sense you know that's our

00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,660
focus that's our mission this idea of

00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:52,820
you know you can use this platform as a

00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,590
pc nobody else is going to do the

00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,300
software like this tons of other people

00:56:54,590 --> 00:57:03,140
that can be the hardware no one else is

00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:04,730
going to do that from the start right so

00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,400
that's why i'm kind of passionate about

00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:10,760
our mission right I was in love with the

00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:13,190
phone and but I put I'll be happy to put

00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,630
our software on everybody's phone and

00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,100
maybe it's better off maybe we're better

00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:20,000
off that way you know it gives you more

00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:23,100
choice and of hardware and in the market

00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,840
next question is from Josh strobel in

00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:28,050
what release cycle do we expect systemd

00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,940
to replace upstart I think it'll be

00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,650
available as a preview for people to use

00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,240
pretty soon I know that there are people

00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,520
in the a bunch of community and

00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,640
canonical in core team who are who are

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,820
passionate about systemd and and who

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,080
will you know work to help debian and

00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,820
and you know make sure that it's

00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,450
possible in a good to just as fast as it

00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:52,500
is in debian to be in a up down with the

00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:54,300
gang and our core commitment from a

00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,940
production point of view is not to break

00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,950
users so i think you should look to this

00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,550
becoming the default somewhere on the

00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,650
road to 1604 and but you know just like

00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,930
upstart arrived almost invisibly if you

00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:09,420
didn't and if you didn't know that you

00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,710
know about it you know what's important

00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,500
is that system d arrived almost

00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,600
invisibly and the system d community or

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,020
anything but invisible they like to be

00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,580
you know in your face but as it comes to

00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,760
a bun to i would like it to be just

00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,720
magic and just work and just be great so

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,950
if you're interested in that police

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,040
climate and help there are lots of guys

00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:32,490
to talk to steve laying a sec Martin pit

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:35,310
and alexander sack Loic menia there

00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:36,869
those are all guys to talk to and and

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,000
have a blast it would be great to see

00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:40,800
that word move into a buncha yeah there

00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,210
was some sessions this week at UDS that

00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,550
obviously recorded some people can go

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,380
and take a look at that next question is

00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,060
from Bob Sam recently there was some

00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,440
comments from wilwheaton that he was a

00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,930
little displeased with the direction of

00:58:49,440 --> 00:59:01,350
a bun to I'm have has anyone reached out

00:58:51,930 --> 00:59:03,690
to him and asked him why Janet oh sorry

00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:08,040
I think the I think we had some network

00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:09,930
leg there and so the question is is from

00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,730
Bob same as anyone reached out to wil

00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,230
wheaton about why is displeased with the

00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,869
direction of ubuntu right now it's just

00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,340
something it was reported on recently no

00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:20,820
I'd left I'd love to chat with him

00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:23,580
because I think it would be interesting

00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:26,520
to hear what what his perspective is and

00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:29,369
I'm very understanding of the fact that

00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:32,590
you know we've which surprised people

00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:36,310
and not always in a good way and

00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:37,960
in in pursuing some of these pioneering

00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:41,730
areas and you know what they say you

00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,930
know pioneers take the arrows right I

00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:46,930
think I've learned some lessons in terms

00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:49,090
of what we moved to being a default and

00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:52,690
when we do it I think it would have been

00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:54,730
valuable for us and to to build unity

00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,670
and then have it be become the default

00:59:54,730 --> 01:00:00,010
when it was clear to everybody that it

00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,630
had great benefits to offer now for

01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:03,070
example I see a lot of people saying

01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,420
that they're super productive with unity

01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:07,060
they love unity they're glad we stuck

01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,830
with it and we know from the statistics

01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,290
that it is by far the most widely used

01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:12,850
ubuntu desktop and almost certainly by

01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:16,120
far the most widely used linux desktop

01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:18,790
right and but i think that we still

01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:23,050
suffer from the fact that we moved hard

01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:25,450
and fast on vision rather than on on on

01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:28,180
quality code that's one of the reasons

01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:30,700
why and the team is super focused on

01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:32,020
everyday quality in this thing right we

01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,390
want people to use this as their phone

01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:40,660
it's the most most personal computer so

01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:42,940
we just don't break it and I hope that

01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:45,970
will and others will be super passionate

01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,800
about what we're doing here and then I

01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:50,800
think you know in the end if you do

01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:52,630
great work forgiveness and the giving

01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,050
forgiveness comes very easily to people

01:00:52,630 --> 01:01:02,890
and i also am a bit surprised by the

01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:05,590
comment because we haven't you organ own

01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:07,720
right and we're still by far the best

01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:09,370
developer environment right i know

01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,590
people who like I mean tons of people

01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:13,000
they have a macbook with mac OS but they

01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,850
develop on a bun to in a virtual machine

01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,740
right so that tells me that actually the

01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,750
commitment of the team to doing great

01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,390
work as free software for the free

01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:26,050
software developer community is super

01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:29,230
strong and Jonna you froze for me there

01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:31,180
did did the guy but I think we're having

01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:33,400
I think I think Google's trying to

01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:35,200
destroy us right now them I'm not seeing

01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,300
any reports on it's either me or it's

01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,610
it's you I don't think people in the

01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,320
onus each animal seen some seen well

01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:43,930
voice the voice seems to be clear I've

01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:46,030
dialed back the bandwidth right it can

01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:50,530
hear us on the IRC channel hello

01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:52,630
and if you can't hello well rather

01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,310
conveniently anyway we're outside I just

01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,870
want to say thank you to you Martha for
