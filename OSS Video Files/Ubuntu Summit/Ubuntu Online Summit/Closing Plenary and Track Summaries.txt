okay we're live all right then so

00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:13,719
welcome everyone welcome to a third day

and the big finale with our first ever

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,880
want to online summit I'm David Linnell

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,490
from be able to community team at

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,650
canonical and this session where we

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,589
traditionally have our chocolates

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,300
summarized content of of the sessions

00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:32,200
that have been happening during this

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:37,690
these three days of discussions today

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm joined by Al Bob on the left from

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,150
the community team with good next and

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,860
Alan is going to summarize the app

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,060
development track follow following by

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,230
daniel roebuck also from the community

00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,640
team he's going to be talking about

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,180
what's been happening on the community

00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:00,040
track Nicholas CAX is going to be

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:02,560
summarizing the users track plant go

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,590
again it went to server engineering

00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,170
manager and described by herself as the

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,189
queen of 12 server is going to summarize

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,289
the server track stifling Isaac is going

00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,929
to summarize the foundations or

00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:19,210
development shark is the is this the

00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:21,159
engineering manager for for for the

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,899
foundations team and we're also joined

00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,109
by a sweet lana belkin who's been

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:29,710
actually rocking the community track but

00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:31,840
he's having some some audio problems so

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:37,960
him he might he might switch between

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,999
herself and Daniel Halbach I think we've

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,659
got quite a lot of exciting content to

00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:45,159
go through so what I'll do is without

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,990
further in the world leave it a little

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,420
bit for our chocolates to start so

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,689
starting with with Alan island even to

00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,329
kick it off yeah sure if my video freaks

00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:02,740
out as it did just now just shout at me

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:06,759
and I'll do something no a psychedelic

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,450
effect so we had a really busy app

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,459
developer track

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:17,700
this new online summit and I want to

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:19,349
particularly call out to necklace who is

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,450
one of the core app developers worked on

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,430
the clock app and has been rocking the

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,079
active track he's been in pretty much

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,750
every single session just taking notes

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,969
leaving sessions doing like an awesome

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,730
job so I want to thank Nick lecture he's

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,099
done an amazing job this this time so

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,879
let's buzz through on Tuesday we had a

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,680
session went to SDK feedback and during

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,340
this session the idea was to feed back

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,919
to the SDK developers any issues or

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,750
questions that came up from app

00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,969
developers there were some interesting

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,639
discussions about pi other side with

00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:00,269
we've talked about how r RM SDK is

00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,500
mostly based around qml and html5 apps

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,919
but there were lots of questions about

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,879
and discussions around using Python

00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,650
instead of Q Maryland at html5 got a

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,599
bunch of feature requests for the SDK

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,560
like supporting rich text in the header

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,569
better support for SG SVG icons and an

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,329
automatic style and performance limped

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,720
checker and there was also a request to

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,970
upstream the in-house improvements like

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,310
the pull to refresh to upstream those

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:36,120
too cute for example we had a music app

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,449
development session on Tuesday which we

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,069
have regular music app corps app and

00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,109
discussions every week we hang out on

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:46,379
IRC and have hangouts everyone's welcome

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:48,479
it's a community developed app and this

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,340
was really just another one of our music

00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,370
at meetings and we discussed the fact

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,669
that we're still blocked on the music

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,680
app moving from grillo to the new media

00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,739
scanner to point oh there's a few

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,900
blockers in there and the music app

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,030
developers a coordinating well with the

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,389
music the media scanner developers James

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,889
henstridge and Thomas boss in order to

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,169
feedback any issues that we gave in the

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:18,000
music app because they're the primary

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:19,829
user of the media scanner to for the rtm

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,389
for those that don't know Artyom is the

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,959
release to manufacturer date which is a

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,539
little bit

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,880
later in the year much later in the year

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:30,000
but for RTL music apps can be tested

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,210
against a bunch of different use cases

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,630
so far we've mostly been testing it with

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,490
our music but we want to increase the

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,370
scope over the next month or so to try

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,410
and get people using the music app under

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,520
different circumstances that we haven't

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:54,360
currently tested for and we we've moved

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:57,060
to using Trello for doing our feature

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,000
tracking and it's an open public trailer

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,970
board and we're tracking all of the

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,220
collapse on there there was a session

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,570
about converging applications across

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,539
devices which is interesting for people

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,669
who are you know writing their first one

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,400
to phone app and want to make sure that

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,820
it works well on desktops and tablets as

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,280
well necklace led that with a demo of

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,050
his application flashback which is a

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,150
great example of a an app that

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,090
dynamically resizes across different

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,820
form factors and some tips and tricks

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,259
were given to take into account before

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,630
you start work on a convergent

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:39,270
application we then had a session on the

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,830
clock app the clock app which many of

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,219
you have seen in compasses o'clock

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,009
alarms timer and stopwatch it's had a

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:49,500
redesign of the recent Malta sprint a

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,530
bunch of collapse developers came along

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,240
and the canonical design team presented

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,550
their new design so we've got a clock

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,740
app reboot and let wish the clock at

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,320
debbies is working on that and went

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:07,130
through the new design and some of the

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:09,300
work items were taken for for that work

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,500
again everything's being tracked in

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,849
Trello and there was a call out for

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
additional developers dive in and help

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,729
with READ&WRITE because it's quite a bit

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,979
of work and we don't have a huge amount

00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:24,780
of time to do that so if clocks are your

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:26,190
thing then by all means join us to help

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,360
out there

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,630
so that's the end of tuesday on

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,020
wednesday there was a bunch of sdk

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,920
features session where the sdk

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:41,350
developers shared the goals for release

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,500
to manufacturer that and and further

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,380
goals beyond release to manufacture

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,850
leading off into October this year those

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,900
were shared with app developers so if

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,880
you're interested in knowing what's

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,610
coming in the SDK over the coming two

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,580
months three months then I'd recommend

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,760
looking at that session there was a lot

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,000
of discussion of how you can use kits

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,860
and yum you later to develop and test

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,790
your application it was a demo of a go

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:16,180
qml app as well and now keep creator has

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:20,050
syntax highlighting for go based

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,669
applications which is confront so in

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,480
summary this summer we're going to get

00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:27,880
the new head of design pull-to-refresh

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,680
text input tweaks converged input layout

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,380
tweaks and in queue creator why have

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,700
support for store integration directly

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,060
from cube creator which is pretty

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,330
awesome scope support the x86 emulating

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,360
go qml support and loads of other stuff

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,919
it's just it's worth there watching that

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,840
session there's loads of good stuff if

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:52,150
you're an app developer um along those

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,710
lines Dave player also had a session

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,960
yesterday about how to use the Ubuntu

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,979
emulator for app development it was a

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,410
good detailed session really good zero

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,110
to hero everything need to know to get

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,450
started with the SDK and develop your

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,160
apps in the immunity the emulator story

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,190
is very important for us especially for

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,720
people who don't have a device so you

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,690
want to be able to test your app in

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,940
phone scientist or phone shaped window

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,430
along with all the other integration

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,729
points that come with with the software

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,660
stack so they did give a great intro to

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,390
all of that and gave a demo of

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,870
a one of our applications reminders that

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:37,020
running inside the emulator was another

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:40,680
session yesterday by Rick Spencer

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,710
talking about one of his apps are called

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,250
get their DC which is a an app that he

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,560
wrote which pulls in a information about

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,660
public transport links in his local area

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,740
and he wrote an application that he uses

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,980
every day in order to find locations for

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,680
buses trains and so on in the DC area

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,670
and he went into a lot of detail about

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,180
how the app was developed and halle uses

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:12,840
location detection and so on it was also

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,210
a web apps workshop yesterday and this

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,520
was a presentation on the web apps

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,680
concept how to create and package or web

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,860
app for a bun to how to fine-tune the

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,840
behavior and there was a code demo on

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,780
how to use the online accounts API to

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,330
authenticate with web services like

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,470
Facebook Twitter and you can do that

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:38,610
both from qml and from html5 as well and

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,800
that wraps up Wednesday today the first

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,020
session we had on the active track was

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,570
the collapse weekly hang out one thing

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,440
that we learned from Malta was that the

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,660
core app developers value having a lot

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,700
of cross application communication so

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,160
rather than just have each application

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,050
developed as a little silent they

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
learned a lot from sitting around the

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,550
table in Malta and talking to each other

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,810
as well as talking to other teams and so

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,120
what we thought we'd do is have a

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,310
regular hangout with as many of the core

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,770
apps as we have to develop as as we can

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,290
in that hanging out in order to keep

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:17,610
that that conversation a conversation

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:22,410
going so I will go through all of the

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:25,980
details there but we we reported on

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,450
progress reported on blockages so that

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,050
we could follow up with those blockages

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,720
and get them unlocked but it was it was

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,760
a really good session mostly for further

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,620
cross collaboration between the core

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,370
apps but is interesting for other people

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,449
too to drop in on as well

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,779
there was another interesting session

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:47,490
led by my children and Kim Van Dyne

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,980
about game development on a run to touch

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,170
and this was a presentation covering

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,389
game engines and when a developer should

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,699
consider using an existing engine or if

00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,639
qml provides what they need already it

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,730
was an introduction to bacon 2d the QM

00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,639
ltd game engine and covered features in

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,459
entering some demos as well it was a

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,490
discussion of the roadmap and showed off

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,550
a proof-of-concept bacon 2d editor Maria

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,499
tired of saying bacon 2d which allows

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:20,009
drag and drop of game entities into a

00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:22,139
scene while running with live editing of

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,329
physics properties so it's quite good

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,889
fun still under active development and I

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:29,790
think Ken's looking for additional

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:32,129
people turn to help out with that we had

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,079
a session on getting involved in core

00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:37,499
apps this was more of a brainstorming

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,600
session for us to try and figure out

00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,850
what we need to do to encourage more

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,879
people to get contributing to the core

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:47,850
apps the clock calendar weather and so

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,009
on and looked at ways in which we could

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,079
reach out to other communities promote

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,139
the events that we're having having more

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,809
hack days and basically anything we can

00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,279
do to try and encourage people to help

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,319
the core apps developers because it's

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,300
not a huge team and they've got a lot of

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:04,980
work to do and they're doing a really

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,439
great job but you know we need more

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,529
people so we looked at ways in which we

00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:15,990
can get more developers interested in

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:20,339
them and and we also had an application

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:24,629
showcase where we had a few apps shown

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:27,379
off and Rick showed off again is get

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,929
their DC my call demonstrated his

00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:33,569
butchery loco eventfinda Markham

00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:36,749
security team showed his very rapidly

00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:39,839
developed tip calc gratuity calculator

00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:43,620
app and I showed off my stupid school

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,639
board application and finally yes I

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,709
finally got the end there was an a

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,269
session about you one DB which it was

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,570
kind of high-level introduction to you

00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,370
on DB

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,220
and the main elements that are useful

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,940
for app developers as hands-on demo with

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,610
a simple you on DB example for storing

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,070
settings few application and a hands-on

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,530
demo with more advanced queries and data

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:15,820
display in lists and I think that's

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:18,550
everything very good at xx a felon for a

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,800
summary of the app development track so

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,900
next perhaps Daniel into Atlanta do you

impressive process to get changes

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,870
automatically built and tested which

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,690
makes it a lot easier for us to land

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:55,650
high quality changes in 12 x lot for

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,020

where the team discussed a number of

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,380
initiatives to make it easier for

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,560
newcomers to get involved with the team

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:11,069
so this includes a cleanup of current

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,880
documentation and referring to it on

example of the buddha genome team and

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,610
setting up a kubuntu promo team to help

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,430
promote and gather contributors and then

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,360

about artwork we had a very interesting

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:21,930
session today about the app development

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,900
training program and this was about

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:30,190
taking all the work we had put into the

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:33,850
app dev school program which we started

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,830
last cycle where local teams such as the

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,630
Chinese team the italian team the

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:44,440
Spanish team they had a lot of workshops

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,980
where people could learn how to do write

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:51,760
apps for 40 boo too and we want to turn

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:55,270
this into a more formal training program

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,120
and the first phase is going to start in

00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:01,900

very interesting because the team was

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,860
reviewing their their website they want

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,870
to get more people involved so they're

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,460
going to conduct a number of interviews

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:27,340
and and see how Lubuntu and and open

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,370
source software I used in in silence

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,360
apples and get more people involved and

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,800
more visibility on on that this way

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:41,770

sure thing um so the easiest track was

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:06,670
actually a new track for this summit and

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,360

encourage you to consider sharing your

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,700
knowledge and a lot of Yvonne tooth by

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,240
hosting a session of the next summit

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,030
it's a it's really quite painless and be

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,160
happy to help anyways it's about but

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,350
talk about the sessions we we had a

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,380
session on the principles of test

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:59,170
offering which Brendon shared and that I

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,150
was actually early this morning he

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,840
shared who's basically a presentation

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,640
talking about writing tests and the

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,770
different motivations for testing and

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,170
some of the common pitfalls and traps so

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:15,070
we talked about different levels of

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,660
testing and the mindset and the goals

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,090
behind testing and talking about how

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,820
testing plays in with releasing but it's

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,560
not necessary motivation for releasing

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,720
code or for writing tests and that sort

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,930
of thing we also talked in to find some

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,270
key terms and had a pretty good

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,300
discussion on just overall testing and

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:37,840
test offering we also had a session on

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:42,580
martini America this was presented by

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,040
cap on savvy we are there's nobody good

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,420
for this session some network

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,760
connectivity sort of prevented us from

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,740
from having a proper videos really

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,210
lagging that sort of thing but if if

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,320
this topics of interest you i highly

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,240
encourage you to check out the etherpad

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,690
there's some links there there's links

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,940
to a discussion post and as well as the

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,630
presentation that we weren't on able to

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,780
present via video and then of course go

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,370
ahead and contact amount if you see but

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,940
see how you might be able to help that's

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,240
where things

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,419
again if his adventures to check the pad

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,120
definitely interesting session Stephen

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:21,519
also shared with us a session entitled

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,929
convergence progress report and he

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:28,600
shared basically the progress on the

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:31,450
convergent desktop so what what's going

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,940
on with unity 8 and so he talked about

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,970
different ways how you can run it today

00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,399
and essentially the best way to run

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,539
today is either to utilize the images

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,450
which are being produced and are

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,950
available on CD image or to actually

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,169
install the package from the utopic

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,610
archive and follow along if you install

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,049
it an early version if you want to

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,580
you're not going to be up to it so

00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,559
really it's best to stay on the

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,830
development version for now or use an

00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:00,129
image and real hardware is best as

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:02,259
virtual machines don't work but world

00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,990
plans the team is going to continue to

00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:06,279
maintain the 87 and they hope to see you

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,610
need e8 development be available

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,980
alongside unity 7 as releases come down

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,039
the line marching towards 1604 which is

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,570
an XLT yet the idea being that the unity

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,220
eight and the converge desktop will have

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:23,860
landed by then um Marco did a really

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,929
awesome session on maximizing your

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,029
productivity with unity so he showed off

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,250
essentially all sorts of really neat

00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:31,720
tips and tricks on using unity I know I

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,090
learned first thing learned several

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,149
interesting things he went through

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,129
keyboard shortcuts scopes work and some

00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:42,149
really interesting interactions I didn't

00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:44,409
even know existed in the scope and

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:46,179
several different just tweaks and that

00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:49,059
sort of thing he also drove into

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:50,379
changing the settings I mean he got

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,509
really technical there's there's things

00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:54,970
available to you if you're willing to

00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,350
dive in and do some decomp editing and

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,419
that sort of thing so things that

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,490
artists so even in the UI really really

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:01,720
interesting stuff and if you wanna you

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,340
one of those people like to really tweak

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,450
their desktop you might be surprised

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:10,779
with just what unity can do so i highly

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:13,210
recommend watching the video or if you

00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,500
wish there's notes that are posted that

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,809
he posted that you can sort of peruse

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,909
through and like i said i know i picked

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:23,750
up a helpful hint or two to incorporate

00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:25,880
them into my own workflow next we have

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,390
a couple sessions presented by ollie and

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,090
so Ali gave a presentation the first

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,710
session on Starkey bun too and what the

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,480
starting front to project is so

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,040
essentially that he gave us some

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,230
background history and talked about the

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,480
goal to the project so start you bun to

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,010
is purpose is to promote you bond too

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,300
and it's official flight never risk to

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,370
folks who are transitioning away from

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,220
windows XP and essentially other

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,840
versions of windows as well the idea of

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,030
being that I support for these older OS

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,400
is dry up and these have older machines

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,260
and they men may or may not be ready for

00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,540
an upgrade but their OS needs to be

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,730
upgraded and so the idea behind the

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,950
project is sort of marketing and Google

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,910
reach and maybe even some support for

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:09,950
people for people migrate the second

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,690
section that Ollie hosted was one called

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,760
how to joining contribute to you bunch

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,250
of communities and this was another

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,890
excellent session we had a lot of great

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,740
feedback and and contributions in the

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:24,830
session essentially Ali covered a

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,510
presentation talking about what it means

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,850
to join and how to join the communities

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:32,030
and start contributing he went through

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,710
several examples looking at a few couple

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,150
different flavors have you Bunty talking

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,740
through specifically how you might go

00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,620
about joining their community what you

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,880
need to do and then we started talking

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,560
about some of the blockers to joining

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,930
and talking about the need to be active

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,730
to not be afraid and to be vocal ali

00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,890
also displays the fallacy that the only

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,590
way to contribute was via development or

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,910
code and pointed out that there are many

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,890
different ways to contribute YouTube

00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,530
you'd be a documentation riya testing

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,630
the outreach we did not design technical

00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,040
support translations the list goes on

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,810
there's a there's a lot of ways to

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,070
contribute to you bunt or one of its

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,940
communities that does not involve

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:14,660
writing code so it was a really sort of

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,670
great way to remind and remember even

00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,520
being vocal and active is a welcome and

00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,110
needed contribution and then to close it

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,030
out we sort of discussed the the joy and

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,670
experience that comes with working with

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,680
other folks who are like-minded and so

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,970
it was a really great session I was

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,740
really thankful for all the people

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:37,130
participated lastly we had a session

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,650
with Ric and Holly and

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,170
was yesterday morning and essentially it

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:45,380
was still a lot of Q&A Rick being in

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:48,500
during VP and Ollie being the desktop

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,090
unity guy so they fielded questions from

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,720
the audience on a wide range of subjects

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:57,110
I picked out a few this will unity a

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,310
require touchscreen no Ali celebrated

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,860
the birth of his son berries and Lenny

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:03,260
congratulations out will me run an older

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,140
hardware if you have open source drivers

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,970
she asked binary drivers it depends

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,730
people asked about porting you Bunty

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,190
touch to their favorite devices again

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,900
answer there is no plans for Theon the

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,610
official devices check the port's guide

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,800
there are a lot of good community ports

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,230
Rick talks a little bit about the cool

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,670
things he liked in unity eight tabs

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,760
switching and all sorts of other good

00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,920
stuff again really emphasizing on unity

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,770
seven isn't dead and one of the coolest

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,210
things that came up was talking about a

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:37,160
port and Rick shared that the way a port

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,870
errors are handled is planning to be

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,310
changed to to sort of make the user

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,160
experience a bit better to auto send

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,050
them prompt prompted batches that sort

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,030
of thing so lots of great too many

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,670
questions in there it was overall

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:54,500
enjoyable hour and that was pretty much

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:56,000
it for the users trip great thanks a lot

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,040
nick and thanks a lot to all of the

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,110
other chocolates for for the users track

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,680
I think it was a really welcome addition

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:06,980
to to this new format of online summit

00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,510
and I'm sure we'll see you will see much

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,600
more used in the in the next time it's

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,760
as well and it'll be much more

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,980
attractive for people who are not only

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,390
interested in discussing development

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:24,230
plans all right so next we should

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:29,660
probably go for server but are you

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:34,580
afraid I am totally up for it so let me

00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,620
tie my notes and so are the the DevOps

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,570
track covered tooth to it won't kind of

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,500
three areas it covered juju and then

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:45,290
also server and OpenStack though Antonio

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:50,710
was kind enough to write up a summary of

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:52,929
the of what happened in the juju section

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,730
to read that but I quickly made sure you

00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:57,010
didn't sneak in anything that would

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,020
might make me say something silly so um

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,720
so I'll start with what happened on the

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,159
GG side of things and of course like

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,419
everyone else you should go watch the

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,679
videos because people put a lot of

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,830
telling that I think there's a lot of

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,230
really amazing content in there so I'm

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,940
on the juju side they wanted to ensure

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,100
folks knew about juju how to orchestrate

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,230
services develop charms and get involved

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,270
with crafting and hopefully for at least

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,070
able to attend you get started with juju

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,840
but if you missed it they'll have plenty

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,730
of they've got term schools coming up

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,740
and that's and you can see what term

00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,649
schools are coming up at dude ubuntu com

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,960
/ events to go check that out attend a

00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:33,580
session and for the charm authors we

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,220
discussed how to use other automation

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,409
tools such as ansible with suit but it

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,000
has a type of little leverage platelets

00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,419
were appropriate have a leveraged LLC

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,350
for local juju development this did you

00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:45,940
lxiii session was one that I'm

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,649
personally very excited about because on

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,049
you know and my server side of things

00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:51,640
we're all about LLC and in general how

00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,289
to start writing your own charms we also

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,690
meter include workflows for folks on

00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:57,130
windows or OSX platforms and for folks

00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,260
interested upcoming events we also

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,179
accessions for the juju GUI and jeju

00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,200
core we also discussed how we are

00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,299
developing solutions around big data

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,250
with juja to do and to finish off the

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:08,230
juju side of things they made sure to

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,230
reason visit the juju charm store policy

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,390
and big folks to help with the term

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,000
audit and antonio and the rest of the

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,340
juju books wanted you to think to those

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,909
who participated in the food we had to

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,169
do sessions so that's that side and it's

00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:24,940
a lovely right up and now you're going

00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,940
to get my more impromptu on this server

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,130
and suicide so that so we had I think a

00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,669
lot of really really amazing awesome

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:36,399
sessions so we had three sessions on LXE

00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:39,250
you got to go listen people so Serge and

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,419
Stepan talk about we had a planning

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,940
session where they talk about future

00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:45,789
plans for LSP we all set a session where

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,470
we demonstrated a lot of the the new

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:52,720
features and uh let's see and how to use

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:55,029
LLC I'm really a really a good session a

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,059
lot of good tips on how to use LC and

00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,889
then we also had a session on user name

00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,630
spaces which they showed you how to use

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:03,399
the new user name space feature in

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,509
general but then also how to use it in

00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,539
containers

00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:11,019
and de fon actually showed us his

00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:16,419
desktop where he has his icons actually

00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:18,579
launched LXE containers and the

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:20,979
absoluteness so for example you know

00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:22,809
chrome starts up in an olive sea

00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,999
container and he's done a blog post on

00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,739
this but looks like green great stuff

00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,269
and I'm personally very motivated to go

00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:29,889
and figure out how to use for my own

00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,559
system because I think it's so cool I

00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,839
don't trust you know apps on my system

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,179
and having in a nice little lightweight

00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,129
jail like I let's see it's fantastic so

00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,409
I'm hoping that we're going to do a

00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:42,789
follow up video soon where he helped me

00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,859
get it set up on my system in it

00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:47,409
everyone else gets to watch so check

00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:49,690
that out people okay so next what's me

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,879
on a system dqa because we are a lot of

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,129
people asking about system d what's

00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:56,619
coming you know when is server going to

00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:59,139
move to it so dimitri from the

00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:01,539
foundations Kate team came and cut up a

00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:04,029
couple slides talked about the plans you

00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:06,759
know how you can start using systems now

00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:10,299
and how we're going to move to it and so

00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:12,249
it's a good discussion basically from

00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:16,089
the server perspective you know if you

00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:17,849
want to use system d in 1410 you know

00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:20,619
this is our time to kind of play with it

00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:24,219
get things sorted out and our plan is

00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:26,379
that in 1504 will will move to assisting

00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:28,509
d or we'll just we'll be doing what what

00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:30,459
what's happening for overall we want to

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,759
but that's kind of the plan at this

00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:35,349
point we also had a certain security Q&A

00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,309
session which is also known as a

00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:41,589
security team read mean tweets so I'm

00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,359
marks effing John from the security team

00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:46,299
cumulant talked about what they do and

00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:48,429
then how to better secure your server in

00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,109
addition to having a little section in

00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:52,839
the end where we had them the security

00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:57,249
guys read mean trait tweets and they

00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:59,469
were great great sports so if you want

00:32:57,249 --> 00:33:01,149
to hear mark talk about what I can't

00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:03,719
jump there was I think there's something

00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:08,469
about security being something about

00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:09,549
there was a cave and a bat poo involved

00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:11,049
so if you want to hear about that you

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,749
need to go you need to go watch this and

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,279
and and a lot of good information in

00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:18,100
that session I got I've heard feedback

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,500
about there being a lot of good stuff

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,539
right before this we had a database

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,820
session and we had several of the key

00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:30,039
community players in the database space

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:33,460
on so we talked about Percona mysql

00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,980
Mariah DB and we'd already had plans to

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,590
move to mysql as the deep- po5 got six

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,289
is the default in utopic but we also

00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,740
talked to some of the issues around

00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:47,440
systemd and some and some other system

00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,840
setup issues we have with my skill and

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,000
then we also on on the meeting to find a

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,940
couple of stretch goals for 14 times so

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Mariah DB is hoping that their goal

00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,960
they're not sure they're going to get

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,260
there is that my ATT 10 would be the

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,010
default for 14 cents with sort of a

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:08,260
stretch goal and then in the kind of

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:12,399
cluster space who are looking at hoping

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:14,230
to get to a common galera package so

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,869
we'll see if that happens that if you

00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,340
really beneficial have common a common

00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:22,149
package because right now we have

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,700
redundancy scott mosier gave a tutorial

00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:26,200
on simple streams so I don't know how

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,419
much you guys hear about simple streams

00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,520
that it provides like all them there's

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,250
the metadata around all the cloud images

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,280
and stuff are all simple streams and

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,280
it's an incredibly powerful tool it's

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,320
rather kind of I would say it's an

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,450
advanced user Toulon's in terms of the

00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,909
command line and so he walks through it

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,679
and definitely worth a watch if you're

00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,970
interested in that and then we had a

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,679
session on how to make the server

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,200
release even more awesome than it

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,350
already is and how did he did debate

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,300
around we want to doing package updates

00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,550
for the LTS I don't think we solved it

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,170
but we were going to continue the

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:05,500
discussion on the mailing list so that's

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,530
kind of what we did on the server side

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,869
and then the OpenStack we had basically

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,330
three main sessions we did we had an

00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:15,340
OpenStack charms track a discussion

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,900
where we talked about what our point you

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,450
know as usual talk about what you know

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,970
what happened in 1404 and what we have

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,040
planned for 14 10 which i think the net

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:28,839
is that it's a really busy busy busy

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,810
cycle but we also talked about for 1410

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,870
we put in place a new OpenStack charm

00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:37,480
I guess policy on where we have like

00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:39,190
basically a stable branch and a next

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,960
branch and we're basically following a

00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,790
bunch of development process about sr

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,790
use and being careful we plot density

00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:49,030
open its felt bring our customers more

00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:51,970
stable high quality charms we also had a

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:54,040
session on OpenStack and once again talk

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:57,340
about what was in 1404 and what's coming

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,200
up in 1410 where it's all supported and

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,240
for how long because that's something

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,820
you know people want to know you know

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,680
what version of OpenStack is supported

00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,360
on trustee and for how long and what

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,880
about Juno which is going to release

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,710
with you topic how long is that going to

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,300
be supported on trustee so that's all in

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:17,110
that session and you can also get that

00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:20,110
if you look at the cloud archive web

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:23,620
page online so we also talked about

00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:26,980
vmware power8 support native LXE ipv6

00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:29,230
and trove and I was pretty please I even

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,960
stump James page with the question so

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:34,330
and then final last session I'll talk

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,450
about so I Ryan visor and the rest of

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:40,660
the team gave a demo on getting some a

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,510
simple openstack cloud deployed we used

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:47,140
a couple ways they so really you know

00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:49,120
kind of you know in on the stage and I'm

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,430
in a lot of places we kind of show okay

00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,960
here you go and you here's how you start

00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,640
it and then we all kind of go into much

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,260
the details and show what's going on

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,090
kind of behind the curtain so our goal

00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,590
is to kind of show what's happening

00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,050
behind the scenes what's really going on

00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,640
and really show like this it's really

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,800
you know we're really getting it done

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,440
really fast and it's really awesome so

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,940
that's it that's what we did we showed

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,950
both a command line and gooey and of

00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,840
course the demo gods were not on Ryan

00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,510
side so right at the end who is having

00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,580
some issue so he plans I think he calls

00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,530
it he's going to have a revenge video

00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,920
soon where he's going to show it all

00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:28,750
going well so that is it for the DevOps

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:31,600
track go back to you David excellent

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:35,110
thanks a lot so as you guys can see a

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:38,200
cloud davis truck was one of the fullest

00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,240
if not fullest track that that we had so

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,490
it's really good to see all of this and

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,349
going on so thanks Patricia for for

00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,960
summarizing that and I think

00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:51,670
last but not least we'll have Steve

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:55,759
linguistic summarizing highlights of the

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:59,539
development track so I leave it up to

00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:01,819
you Steve thanks David so yeah we had a

00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:03,890
very exciting start to the Ubuntu

00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:05,749
development track this week with the

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,779
first session of the week on Tuesday was

00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:11,420
the KDE frameworks libraries for all

00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:13,069
cute users in this session David

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,499
Edmondson talked about how the KDE

00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:17,329
community has been building on top of 15

00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:20,150
years of experience with desktop

00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,829
environments and apps using cute and

00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,799
they've now released an entire set of

00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:27,140
modularized cute libraries to tackle all

00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:29,390
kinds of tasks ranging from extraction

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,180
of zip archives to policy get to

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,220
handling of emoticons so this includes

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,589
how everything has been modularized and

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,390
split into a tier based framework to be

00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:40,579
easily reusable in any cute based

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,710
application including ubuntu mobile apps

00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:45,920
which should save many hours of the

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,900
development time the next session up was

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,759
about how to get your patch into debian

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,339
and ubuntu this is a good session for

00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:54,619
anybody who has ever had concerns about

00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:57,200
getting their their code changes

00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,789
included in the distribution it covered

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,160
patch life cycles from creation to

00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:03,349
submission to review and landing in the

00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,109
archive the focus on this particular

00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:08,630
session was on non Ubuntu upstream

00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:11,269
projects which typically come into the

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,210
12 by way of Debian and the wider open

00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:16,219
source community upstream projects and

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,170
then in a follow-up session there was a

00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:20,269
focus on Ubuntu upstream projects and

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,430
how merge proposals test plans and

00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:24,859
continuous integration are used to land

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,660
updates and patches via the sea I

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:29,359
trained with also some words about the

00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,369
upcoming CI airline so if you are

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,039
interested at all in getting your code

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,539
changes integrated into a bun too and

00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,219
you're wondering where to start between

00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,410
those two sessions that should give you

00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:40,400
the answer so I encourage you to go look

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,859
at those videos if you have any

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,650
questions about that we then it also had

00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:49,009
this week the new topic Ubuntu

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,170
Engineering Corps roadmap where the boot

00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:53,059
Engineering Corps teams each reflected

00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,390
on their deliverables for the from the

00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:59,119
1404 release and also discussed upcoming

00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,820
plans for the 1410 cycle some of the big

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,040
topics in

00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,050
who did network convergence you topic

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,090
kernel versions the release to

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:10,320
manufacturer milestones and the CI

00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:12,420
airline as Pat mentioned the bunch of

00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,390
development in cloud DevOps had a shared

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,890
session focusing on system d

00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,330
deliverables it was a mixture of

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,670
presenting the current state of affairs

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:23,220
and commitments for 1410 as well as

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,900
responding to user developer and system

00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,450
and concerns regarding this transition

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,180
so the team identified a few areas which

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:33,180
hadn't yet been covered and considered

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,490
in in the discussion so far in

00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,800
particular around cloud images and

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,900
OpenStack adoption no system d in the

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,180
wind to further discussions about that

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,550
will be taken to blueprints and mailing

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,210
lists so all the mailing lists if you

00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,590
want to be part of that conversation

00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,180
there isn't a session about click on the

00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,340
desktop where the team discussed the

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,680
next steps for bringing click packages

00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,630
to the Ubuntu desktop in a mirror

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,910
desktop session it will be possible to

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,400
install clicks via the unity click scope

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,520
we just need to ensure the cliq package

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,160
get plugins plug-in works well with the

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,450
existing abdomen infrastructure and we

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,780
need to fix some issues around the

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:16,710
platform a web browser on the desktop in

00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,990
order for this to fully work a related

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,000
session discussed the unity 8 desktop

00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:24,180
preview session which will be available

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,120
in 1410 as a separate image with unity

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,390
on mirror no xorg and the ability to run

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,650
gtk and cute apps full screen and the

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,620
ability to install and run click

00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:39,330
packages work on session management for

00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:41,610
unity 8 is ongoing next there was a

00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,170
session about system images for servers

00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,660
in which the team discussed how to build

00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,060
a read-only image updated version of

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,100
ubuntu core including some basic

00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,350
building blocks such as click juju and

00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,780
lxc to run contained workloads on top of

00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:56,490
it to date the system image updates have

00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,870
been targeted for over-the-air updates

00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:00,060
on phones but some of the same

00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,680
principles see reusability for server

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,930
environments and the system image design

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,960
includes a non-interactive back-end that

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,760
can be used in a GUI 'less context too

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,910
so the plan for 1410 is to provide an

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,410
experimental amd64 only version which

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,680
people can either run in a V

00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,840
or flash to a USB stick boot use and

00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,530
update using system image as it's done

00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,120
on the phones today and then finally we

00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,430
had some some roadmap sessions

00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,260
complementing the the web apps workshop

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,520
session on the app development track the

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,710
web apps team presented their

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,670
development roadmap which you should be

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,610
able to find a link to the presentation

00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,410
of from the US session page and the

00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,600
unity team also presented their roadmap

00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:42,060
in two sessions one on the roadmap for

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,080
unity api's and one for the unity eight

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,660
and miR roadmap so good sessions

00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,340
everyone it's been a great track and a

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:55,070
lot of exciting content I hope you all

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,070
go out and and view those sessions

00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:01,710
excellent thanks a lot Steve so if these

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,560
are thing we close what I think has been

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:07,080
yet another successful went online some

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,140
it's actually our first ever in this

00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,590
format we've been very excited to see

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,360
the new users track as we've said before

00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,640
we've wanted to make the event much more

00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,570
inclusive much more appealing to those

00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,370
who are not generally participating in

00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,520
development and I think that's worked

00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:28,380
very well from see them from the

00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,380
feedback from from users were very very

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,330
satisfied with with the outcome on T of

00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,070
the new users track and also with the

00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:38,100
format with the new presentations not

00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:41,310
only it's not so you us is not only

00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,290
about development discussions but we've

00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,150
seen quite a lot of content and quite a

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:48,390
lot of teams that have been presenting

00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:52,920
the progress from from the last summit

00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:56,460
and which coming towards rtm for the

00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,800
next summit we will have phones and

00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,710
tablets on the market so expect much

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,960
more exciting content coming up coming

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,850
on and I'm really really excited to

00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:11,160
actually be part of the next summit and

00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:13,140
as a final load then what I'd really

00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,390
like to do is to tell everyone that's

00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,790
participated and was made this some

00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:21,290
impossible possible any kind of

00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,550
participation either contributors users

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,410
engineers developers translators

00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,060
documentaires everyone who's been

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,370
watching the sessions participated in

00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:32,520
tensions and in particular to chocolates

00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:34,560
chocolates work sometimes in the

00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,970
background but they're the ones who make

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,740
sure that the sessions on their tracks

00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,600
are really well coordinated their

00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,970
scheduled and essentially that

00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,230
everything runs smoothly so thank you

00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,950
everyone to our clicks thank you

00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:49,440
everyone what's been participating and I

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:52,530
think with this we can wrap up perhaps

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,310
go for a virtual or physical beer and

00:44:52,530 --> 00:45:01,070
see you all at the next us thanks about

00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,070
