where life

00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:23,019
well let's dive straight in David thank

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,710
you for hosting me here today and hello

00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:29,529
everybody who's joined us and I am

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,529
speaking with you from Singapore where

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,790
I'm on a tour of Asia together with some

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,739
colleagues meeting members of the

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,839
community along the way and talking

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:40,690
about cloud computing and how that is

00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:43,870
transforming the enterprise and the

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,729
world of startups and all sorts of

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,879
people who are not able to do things

00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:51,219
much faster much more easily and almost

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,829
certainly almost always with Ubuntu

00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:56,710
which is which is really wonderful I've

00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,239
met I had the chance to meet leaders of

00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,149
the friendship went to community when we

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,910
were in Paris and I have to meet members

00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:07,450
of the appointed community here on this

00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,850
Asian stretch as well and so without

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,500
further ado I wanted to dive in and and

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,429
talk through a couple of points for our

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,280
online summit this is this week is where

00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:23,470
we will gather together to map out the

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:27,130
road to 15 10 and I wanted to highlight

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,770
what I think are the biggest and most

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,770
profound things going on in the Ubuntu

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,930
community today as always that goal is

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,850
to bring the very best of the free

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,090
software world to the very widest

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,119
possible audience and it has been 10

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,250
years since the very first group of we

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,990
call ourselves the warthogs got together

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:52,390
to to get that mission and away so I

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,210
should I suppose I should start with a

00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,539
big thank you to all of you who have

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:03,189
been part of this wonderful journey over

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:07,270
a decade of computing of all sorts so

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:10,450
diving straight in and the the first

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:13,470
thing I wanted to talk about is this

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,239
extraordinary move to convergence in

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,010
personal computing you know the form

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,310
factors of personal computing have

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,730
evolved faster during this last 10 years

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,769
than at any time in the generation

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,350
before that and I don't think the

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,060
disruption is finished yet

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,790
you know when when we started a bunch of

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,940
people said ah the pc you know if you're

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,940
not windows you'll never you'll never

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,940
gain any traction on the pc nonetheless

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,800
we saw ubuntu and free software

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,720
platforms become absolutely central to

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,270
all kinds of personal computing not the

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,640
pc but all kinds of personal computing

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,340
and for developers we certainly showed

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,990
that building a free software platform

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,440
that is crisp and clean and classy

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,390
really makes a big difference now four

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,350
years ago we mapped out a new vision a

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:09,640
vision of convergence and that

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:12,630
convergence is now real today right now

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,970
you can install software on your phone

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,590
and have it present for you a desktop

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,090
experience that same software can

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,170
present for you a desktop experience now

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,960
those of you who've been with us on the

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,630
unity journey know that our key focus

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,400
has been in designing so that all of

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,230
these form factors fit together and I

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,290
think as the rest of the world catches

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,950
up to the idea of convergence that we

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,070
because of that long thoughtful process

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,160
still have the Crispus and cleanest and

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,680
most thoughtfully laid out version for

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,010
how all of these different form factors

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,510
will come together now I kind of want to

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,330
just reflect for a little while about

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,710
what's great about Ubuntu first we are

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,870
an open platform and we invite

00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,370
contributions from all over the free

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,200
software spectrum and all over the

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,670
proprietary software spectrum to you

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,760
know I can run skype on my ubuntu

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,560
desktop and while i would prefer for it

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,360
to be free software I enjoy the fact

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,430
that I can talk to people all over the

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,600
world and and I'd not force my choices

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,640
on to them but we can still talk I think

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,549
most of us believe that free software

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,150
and open source produce consistently a

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:27,490
higher quality and a more secure kind of

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,350
software and I think many in the free

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,570
software community have now also come to

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,040
understand in large part through

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,080
leadership within a bun to that design

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,940
can help achieve a better experience

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,210
both for developers for computing

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,919
professionals and also for

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,569
for all of the people we love all the

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,630
people who use technology as a way to

00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:51,880
get other things done so I think a bum

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,030
to has come to represent and the

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,569
cleanest leanest focus on both free

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:01,090
software and design for future

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,400
experiences and I think it's time now

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,220
for us really to accelerate that lead

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,039
but it's also time for us to welcome

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,449
other people to that to that vision and

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,389
i think i think it's it's really

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,490
important for us to be sure that

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,160
developers who are comfortable

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,949
developing for genome or for KDE feel

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,160
that their applications will absolutely

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,990
be welcomed in a converged world on a

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,259
bun too and so I want to extend an

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:36,099
invitation to developers across all of

00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:38,139
the desktop environments and to help

00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:42,280
bring their applications to this

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:47,199
converged world to phones to tablets to

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,360
pcs and beyond I think we're seeing an

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,860
incredible change in the personal

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,320
computing landscape because of the

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,330
disruption of mobiles and we've seen

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,130
companies even giant companies like

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,380
Microsoft completely change their

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,060
position I don't know if you saw the

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,919
announcements from Microsoft BUILD

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,039
conference but there were two that

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,770
caught my eye one of course was was

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,860
their demonstration of a phone that

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,889
could give you a desktop experience and

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,560
I think that's a wonderful validation of

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,560
the ideas that we've we've articulated

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,320
over the last few years and I'm proud

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,740
that we've been the team that has led

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,599
free software to that vision but the

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,820
other was equally interesting and that

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,729
was a demonstration of Microsoft's

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,789
development tooling running on a blimp

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:41,110
and I think that's enormously important

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:43,449
because it shows that we're entering a

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:49,090
world where every company understands

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:51,520
the value of open environments and that

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,820
means that there's an opportunity for us

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,349
to work together across platforms with

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,129
all sorts of companies to bring

00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,409
application

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:02,050
to this new world now I've had

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:04,360
absolutely no conversations with

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,309
Microsoft on this topic but I think if

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,919
we're seeing the world's leading

00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:11,080
software companies bring their

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,599
development tools to a boon to along

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,759
with Android and iOS that there's a

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,309
reasonable prospect that if we work

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,679
together as a community and we are open

00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:23,619
and we're focused and we're generous and

00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:26,349
we're thoughtful and our story is great

00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:29,619
that we can in fact bring all the

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:32,769
world's applications to a free software

00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:35,259
platform will have to compete will have

00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:38,439
to be great but if like me you believe

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,779
that free software has the potential to

00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,699
succeed on security and design and

00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:46,229
experience then I think we owe to

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:49,990
ourselves and to give that a go so I'm

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,719
issuing a call to people who participate

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,119
in every desktop environment this is a

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,939
seminal moment in personal computing

00:07:55,119 --> 00:08:01,179
once again we're about to see personal

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:04,929
computing disrupted transformed changed

00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:07,209
and history shows that if you are there

00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:09,999
in that moment then you have the

00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:14,379
opportunity to bring people with you and

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:17,169
to bring people to your platforms so my

00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:20,469
call is to folks who've worked on all of

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,329
the Linux desktop environments to set

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,729
aside our differences to recognize that

00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:26,829
the opportunity now is bigger than all

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,709
of those differences to create

00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:32,620
experiences that span phones and tablets

00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:35,169
and PCs to bring all of our very best

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,479
desktop applications none of which are

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,949
exclusively on one desktop environment

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,050
or another to everybody and we will for

00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:47,740
our part do what we can to make sure

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,990
that it is easy for desktop applications

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,189
from genome KDE and other desktop

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:57,250
environments to be fantastic in unity in

00:08:54,189 --> 00:09:00,430
a converged world I'd like to announce

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,240
that we are going to ship a device this

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,899
year with a manufacturer which will fit

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,690
in your pocket which will be a phone and

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:14,380
which will give you a desktop experience

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,430
so that pocket pc experience is real on

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:21,370
a bun too and while i enjoy the race i

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:24,790
also like to win and i bet you do too

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,000
and so will be lovely for us to drive

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,680
free software first into the convergence

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,530
world it's a great privilege for me to

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,390
have mapped out that future to have work

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,360
to the team that's really passionate to

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,210
have enjoyed participation from such a

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,850
wide audience we have such an incredible

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,420
group that contribute developers to this

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,450
new version of ubuntu and now the

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,010
prospect of reaching out our arms to an

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,480
even wider community of developers and

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,250
to say if you're going to do convergence

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,020
this is the most elegant the most

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,090
tasteful the most secure way to do it

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,010
not to denigrate other people's effort

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,680
but just to say that in the business

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,380
models of today in the culture of today

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,450
in the spirit of openness that we see

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,600
coming into every aspect of computing

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,120
today perhaps it's worth us working

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:23,920
openly to to achieve this vision

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:27,220
together there is a real opportunity the

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,680
next area that i think is really

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,230
exciting in a bunch of today is almost

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,450
on the opposite end of the spectrum

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,510
think of all of the devices in your

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,430
house today that are connected in one

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,280
way or another your telephones or your

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,520
actual physical telephones and your

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,690
television the set-top boxes attached to

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,030
your television the home gateway Rueter

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,710
if you have any switches those are all

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:58,720
electronic devices that are connected

00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:01,480
and cameras security systems we are

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,550
again at one of those decisive moments

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:11,100
in history where the nature of those

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,810
devices is going to change and the

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,630
opportunity for us as a community is to

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:21,339
present the world with a crisp clean

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:23,650
free firmware essentially for all of

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,490
those devices now in the last six months

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,760
since we

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,910
we last had our online summit and we

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,060
launched a new flavor of a bun to a new

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,990
rendition of ubuntu we call it snappy

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Ubuntu and snappy butch is all the same

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,740
things that you know and like about a

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,940
bunt to all the same Colonels and

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,760
libraries but packaged in a different

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,209
way packaged in a way that is really

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,610
perfect for these classes of devices

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,010
these devices are everywhere they need

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,660
to be secure they're in our houses they

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,640
have cameras they have microphones they

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:05,200
need to be secure and but they also are

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,270
ideally open devices where you can

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,820
install applications from a wide range

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,860
of vendors where you can choose what

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,750
software you run and when you update it

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,880
how you updated you can manage them

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,920
today one of these devices are running

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,930
many of them running Linux but we have

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,820
no control over that Linux there's this

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,680
it's very hard to find firmware updates

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,500
it's very hard to install applications

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,970
there are some communities that that

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,209
make this work in a particularly

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,390
communities like dd-wrt and tomato and

00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,829
who do this for home Reuters but I think

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,470
there's an opportunity for us to

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:41,620
essentially bring that to a much wider

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,170
audience and also to enable those

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,779
communities who do care about rooting

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,570
for example to go much faster to support

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,300
a much wider range of devices so I want

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,420
to give you a little bit of a tour of

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,329
snappy boom to core and and how it works

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,839
and why and we think it could be the

00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:03,300
free firmware effectively for the world

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,670
now if you think for a minute about

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,500
debian-based ubuntu right we present the

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,029
world with a file system and it's a

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,770
well-known file system we have all the

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,459
all the good stuff there and it's fresh

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:19,089
and then this huge selection of packages

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:21,130
45,000 packages which can write anywhere

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,660
so when you install a package it can

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,339
write anywhere anywhere on the file

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,740
system can be written by any package

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,329
them as you add applications they can

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,790
start to collide with each other they

00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,500
can start to overwrite one another's

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,900
files until it becomes difficult to

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,279
learn who's really responsible for any

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,990
given piece now what we did with

00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,350
snap use we said we wanted to tease

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,870
those parts apart so we start with some

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,939
read-only images some images that cannot

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,970
be modified they can only be replaced

00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:53,639
entirely so your kernel is an image like

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,129
that the operating system itself is a an

00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,319
image like that we call that a snap and

00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:00,360
those are read-only making them read

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:03,509
only allows us to do this very elegant

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,759
thing about updating or rolling back and

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:09,839
knowing exactly which version of the

00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,639
software is running at any given time of

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,069
course every device is different so we

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,959
do create a space for each snap where it

00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,999
can write some information the

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,430
configuration for the kernel which

00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,740
modules to load and so on or aspects of

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,540
configuration or things that the OS

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,930
needs to keep track of can be written

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,759
into a dedicated writable space and then

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,149
applications have exactly the same story

00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,209
we call them snaps again and those apps

00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:38,129
each are read-only images which can only

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,410
be an updated or rolled back together

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:43,139
with a writable area and all writable

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,899
areas which which encapsulate

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,809
essentially all of the user information

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:54,360
around those applications and so snappy

00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:56,850
Ubuntu is everything that you know about

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,639
Ubuntu and everything that's familiar to

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:04,319
you about it 12 but it also has this

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:08,910
tremendous and crispness that allows you

00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:13,259
to know exactly where you stand with any

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,740
given a file on any given device so

00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:19,649
snappy able to has the potential to go

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,850
everywhere and we have we participated

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:27,179
for example last week in a hackathon

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,929
that was hosted by GE and GE first build

00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:33,839
and invited people from all over the US

00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,850
to participate in this hackathon and

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,850
they made some incredible devices some

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,029
of which ran snappy we're also working

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,339
with network equipment vendors we took a

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:48,170
little pc with a bunch of mint reports

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,860
to mwc and by the end of the week we had

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,170
f5 load balancer

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,470
plug in and they're from Microsoft that

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,080
were sending data to assure we had

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,990
another snap which was controlling some

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,300
robots that were on the network and so

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,160
this little x86 switch was suddenly

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,060
becoming really smart with all kinds of

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,510
interesting and capabilities and devices

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:16,630
so the opportunity is there to

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:20,020
essentially bring this platform to a

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,730
very wide range of devices and more

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,210
interestingly to bring a very wide range

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,660
of capabilities to all sorts of

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,760
platforms and and so there's a new for

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,040
new community forming in a bloom to

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,270
around snappy it has all the things that

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,460
you'd expect mailing lists and bug

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,540
trackers and things like that it's

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:43,120
reusing all the same code this OS snap

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,220
effectively is built from our existing

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,500
archives from our existing packages when

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,450
the update and when we have to fix a bug

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,400
we fix it in our existing archives with

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,810
existing packages and then we build the

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,340
updated version of that OS snap so I

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,900
want to invite those of you who are

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:05,350
hackers and inventors to look at the

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:08,350
snaps that are available 1504 it was the

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:12,310
first released version of snappier bunty

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:15,430
and dive in and tell us what you'd like

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:19,350
to see fixed make some snaps and let's

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:24,310
see what's possible in this new world

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:26,800
and in my mind and there's an enormous

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,560
spectrum of devices that are smart

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,140
enough to run ubuntu interesting enough

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,380
and to want to be open and extensible

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,900
and managed and secure and but

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,420
essentially defined by relatively few

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,910
applications and some of these are in

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,860
progress right now with snappy ability

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,250
i'd like to unleash all of our

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:51,550
imaginations and and see what kinds of

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,100
snaps we can create and you can host

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,070
those snaps anyway github where if you

00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,700
like and and we will also gladly publish

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,940
them for you as unbelievable into

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,779
umbrella

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:09,019
to the world in in the new world of

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:10,789
smart things the apps define the object

00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,100
and this is your opportunity essentially

00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,980
to define what's possible with the

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,600
objects that you care about and that

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,080
brings me to the last of the three big

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,519
leagues of computing today where I think

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,639
Apple too is making a huge difference

00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,429
and that is the cloud now you'll know

00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:33,470
that a bun to is enormously popular on

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:36,139
the cloud and with nearly nearly seventy

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,269
percent of the work clothes on the major

00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,580
public clouds running on a blimp too so

00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,019
that means the developers are loving a

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,789
bun to in a cloud environment and we

00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,919
continue to be interested in figuring

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,809
out what they need what they want how to

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,610
make it better how to polish off rough

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:54,350
edges if you have ideas in that regard

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:57,289
please and please dig in and what we're

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,179
keen to do is to raise the level of

00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:02,240
collaboration in the free software

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,620
community another notch you know today

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,009
we come together and we collaborate

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,929
around platforms and packages and but I

00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:11,470
think it's possible actually for us to

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:14,450
collaborate at a much higher level

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:18,110
across platforms and across clouds and

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,470
for us that's what juju is all about and

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:25,399
so juju is aware of encapsulating what

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,720
experts know about a piece of software

00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,490
when it's running on the top of the

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,049
cloud so this for example is a picture

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:35,600
of a fancy Hadoop and infrastructure

00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,620
hold on a sec I just need to lick clear

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,620
into the room hold on

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:52,500
so here we have a bunch of charms that

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,450
encode Hortonworks Hadoop that could run

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,640
on any cloud and you can see my sequel

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,630
is on the screen as well so that is a

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,190
collection of software that could be

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,080
running at any sort of scale it could be

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,419
thousands of nodes or it could be three

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,390
nodes running running on your desktop

00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,669
and essentially that's an encapsulation

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,169
of those pieces of software that you

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,750
would find us packages on a bone tool

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,390
you would find this github and running

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,850
on the cloud in a way that you could you

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,450
could stand up very very easily

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:26,520
automatically this is docker for example

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,309
this is a distributed system for running

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,790
docker applications something like six

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:35,010
out of seven docker images on the docker

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,840
registry the docker hub are based on

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,059
ability so we know once you develop as

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,640
love Dhaka so here is a distributed

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,910
system for and a darker the way darker

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,830
ink would like you to run there and this

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,040
is what OpenStack looks like to us right

00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,530
this is a set of services each services

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,080
open source it's defined by a charm

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,549
which itself is open source and just by

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,130
dragging and dropping these things onto

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,830
a canvas we were able to stand up an

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:06,360
openstack cloud on a cloud or on bare

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:09,120
metal inside each of these boxes you'll

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,799
find something called a charm and now

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,740
that charm is usually open source as

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,900
well this is Cuban 80s this is Google's

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,419
docker command and control system and

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,630
the Cuban eighties project just pulled

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,950
in the charms into the upstream code so

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,950
now if you check out Cuban eighties

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,470
upstream you'll see the charms which are

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,080
themselves free software and which

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,950
define the ways in which you can spin

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,840
this software up on all the clouds and

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,929
hosted upstream so there's a wonderful

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,820
opportunity for us to collaborate with

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,040
the other platforms juju and these

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,140
charms can be written for sent OS and

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,910
for windows so there's a wonderful

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,330
opportunity for us to collaborate across

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,820
platforms to enable people to get this

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,620
software up and running even faster so

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,120
this is sort of orthogonal to the

00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,460
traditional packaging these

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,350
the software here might might come from

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,410
packages or it might come directly from

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,600
github and but again a bunch is all

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,000
about collaborating openly bringing the

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,550
best expertise into one place where it's

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,120
easy to find and then sharing it evenly

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,860
so that people can get what they need to

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,760
get done safely securely they can get

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,070
updates safely securely anywhere on any

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,230
cloud on the Internet so if you dig into

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,030
a charm you'll see it has a charm has a

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,340
page just like a package has a page it

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,530
has instructions and this is the my

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,850
secret charm if you look down on the

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,740
right there you'll start to see what's

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,929
inside that charm it's really just a

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,660
like a package a collection of scripts

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:41,280
and files that encodes all the different

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,170
things that the cloud needs to know

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,050
about that software in order to stand it

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:48,690
up if i zoom into this hooks directory

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,070
over here this hooks directory

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,559
essentially contains all of the

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,330
intelligence but what to do with my

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,330
sequel when i connect it up to set for

00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,210
example when i connect it up to other

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:03,059
members of a my sequel cluster when i

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,950
set it up for high-availability all of

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,980
that intelligence is encoded as open

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:11,550
source in Python or in shell or in mo

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,750
jayus in these scripts over here and so

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,760
that's something that we can all hack on

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,490
all of us who knows stuff about how to

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,050
how to install software on the card how

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,900
to scale software on the cloud how to

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,730
configure and connect and secure

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:28,410
software on the cloud this is the place

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:31,620
to collaborate to make that happen okay

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:34,830
well it's been an amazing six months a

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,210
big welcome to the Ubuntu mate community

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,480
which are now an official part of the

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:44,460
family thank you to Martin and and his

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,580
Merry Men and also a big welcome to the

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,490
Ubuntu core and snappy crowd and there's

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:55,290
a very energetic mailing list talking

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:59,130
about snappy on autopilot for for drones

00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,960
and and on robots lots of interesting

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,030
stuff happening with robotics and snappy

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,970
but also network equipment switches

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:09,250
Reuters gateways and so on so welcome to

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,990
all of you a big thank you to

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,830
leads across the whole community the

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,540
community council and the leads of all

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,420
of these parts of the project we're a

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,750
huge project and we count very very much

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:27,670
on the leads of every part to set a very

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:30,010
high standard and for their both of

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,140
technical leadership but also of social

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,410
leadership and keep us all aligned keep

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,720
us working well together I hope that you

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,890
guys have a fantastic week and you get

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,510
to talk about the things that you're

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,370
interested in we get to figure out how

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,130
we're going to deliver not just the next

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,950
version of ubuntu but the broad platform

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,380
that powers free software in all of

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,300
those flavors and additions on all of

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,060
those clouds and now on all of those

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,980
devices as well and I want to restate my

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,800
enthusiasm for bringing to our converged

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,430
world the world that we've led and

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,950
applications from every desktop

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,560
environment and from other platforms you

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,690
know if we've got thee if we've got the

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,210
development tools from every platform on

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,640
a bun too thin and we've got the gaming

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,790
development tools from every platform on

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,340
ubuntu then we should do what we can to

00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:24,730
bring the applications in the games to

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,260
two the free platforms as well and so

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,420
thank you to all of those those of you

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:35,350
who lead that work and last the the

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:38,130
teaser trailer for W and thank you to

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:41,170
everybody who made witty and wise

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:44,080
suggestions for both adjectives and

00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:47,470
animals and I'm delighted to announce

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,560
the winning name which is that the next

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:55,810
cycle a mascot for the next cycle will

00:25:50,560 --> 00:26:01,300
be the wily werewolf and so thank you

00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:04,870
all for your participation and I'm happy

00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,420
to take questions and David is going to

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,700
chair us through through that process

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,230
David are we gonna drop them in the chat

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,220
window here or should I hop onto an IRC

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:17,500
channel yes so essentially um this is a

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,540
reminder for all of you who are asking

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,679
your questions you're probably on Google

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,480
too narrow to come

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,119
you'll find the chat widget where you

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,830
can ask your questions I just remember

00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,779
to pace them to great ending with

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,450
question we copy the letter so that to

00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:33,039
wait on these any of your questions for

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,169
those of you who are not on google

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:42,309
toenail that cone you can join directly

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:45,460
on the ubuntu dash UDS dash plenary IRC

00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:47,169
channel up until now we've been queuing

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,869
up some questions mark so I think we'll

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:57,850
just start with those let me just find

00:26:49,869 --> 00:27:00,129
the first one just right with me all

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,990
right there are 63 other than the name

00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:04,029
itself that simply quite although

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,740
excitement about snappy and the first

00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,869
question is actually from Daniel over

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,749
and he's asking what's the feedback on

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:17,940
is not the apparel until now um so

00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:20,350
feedbacks been super encouraging the the

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,330
the crowd who are working with these

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,700
little embedded devices I you know all

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:28,029
brilliant and of course capable of doing

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,220
things and you know beyond my

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,629
imagination right there they can get

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,429
down heck and the colonel they can get

00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:36,730
right up in heck on the app and but the

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:39,549
feedback has been how easy it is for

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,470
them to kind of stand up snappy on a

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,669
device and then to start making snaps

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,470
it's different it's a different

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,080
experience because we have to tease all

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,460
those parts apart but the feedback is

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,869
that it really solves a bunch of

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,029
problems that people have had they've

00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:53,139
got their app they've got running on

00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:55,029
Linux and they've got running on their

00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,710
device but it solves a bunch of problems

00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:58,090
snappy solves a bunch of problems that

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,309
they have had in terms of thinking about

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,649
how they are going to deliver updates to

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,809
those devices refresh the applications

00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:07,320
address security issues and manage those

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,610
devices so that's really encouraging and

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,809
the other feedback that we've had is

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,039
that for people who want to build and

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,419
ecosystems around their devices you know

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,970
attracting developers it's much easier

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:20,649
to attract developers and to a shared

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,980
platform than it is to a fragmented

00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:29,230
platform so that's really encouraging as

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:32,710
well but there's still lots lots to do

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,029
and fix it's very new so you know a bugs

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,859
and patches welcome we had

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,749
some great commentary on the list from a

00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,979
guy who came on and said he he'd worked

00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,259
through all the documentation and found

00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:43,659
out all the places where where snappies

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,249
moved on since we first wrote the the

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:47,049
docks when it was originally released so

00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:52,450
that that's hugely welcome thank you

00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:57,429
very much excellent so next question

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,989
from DSD dgds could you tell us abbraxa

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:02,139
the approximate date of the release of

00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:05,229
the mx4 with the 12 will it be before

00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:09,789
May ends and also how long will you

00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:12,460
support the nexus 4 two questions I

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:16,239
can't answer I'm afraid and one because

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,649
it's it's an announcement of another

00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,869
company's product which is not my place

00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:22,570
to make but I can't tell you that

00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:24,999
excitement is building on on in both

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,950
companies and we are full steam ahead

00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:29,349
and the launch will in fact be bigger

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,779
than we originally expected in terms of

00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:35,049
covering more countries which is very

00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:37,899
exciting the precise date is is theirs

00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:39,669
to reveal as for the nexus 4 i'll leave

00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,609
that up to the engineering teams i have

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,859
one and i think it's quite good too to

00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:46,869
maintain support for all the hardware i

00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:49,509
think it lets us test the applications

00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:52,690
and so on in a less capable environment

00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:54,279
and so I hope that support for that

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,009
continues for some time certainly

00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:58,599
through to 1604 but our in terms of

00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,960
commitments to that I will ask you to

00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:09,309
ping that question to Rick Spencer in

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:10,960
his Merry Men all right copy this is

00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,739
asking are there any plans for no one to

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,729
stick such as chrome k story comcast or

00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:20,080
much steak great question so I really

00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,999
like this new form factor that's

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,940
emerging of tiny little sort of gum

00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:26,859
sticks and and in fact I think it's

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,259
great for the companies who have been

00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:31,119
driving that to lead that work we are

00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:36,039
delighted with Intel's decision to

00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:39,219
support a bun to on their small HDMI

00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,139
device and and of course gumstix and a

00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:43,330
number of others have announced similar

00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,609
devices with ubuntu as well so it's not

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,670
really our place to to compete with them

00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:50,010
or two to control

00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,260
the use of ubuntu in that way we we

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:56,250
rather work with them support them and

00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:03,600
and and and and do our part to to make

00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:05,100
them be successful okay akira think part

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,140
is asking have you ever had

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,940
conversations with either Bill Gates

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,500
Steve Jobs Steve Ballmer minister balls

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:17,550
Richard Stallman tim cook or satya

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:20,640
nadella would you talk about that's an

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:23,130
interesting question I did meet Bill

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
Gates I met him in a bathroom actually

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,360
has it had them completely by accident

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,620
and it was it was quite awkward but we

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,330
had a very brief conversation about

00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,140
robotics which which I thought was

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,770
interesting he seemed genuinely

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,960
interested in the sort of emerging

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:40,470
trends of robotics and that was about a

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,290
year before before a bun to hit hit hit

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,700
the streets and and trying to think who

00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:50,460
else you asked will of course I've met

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:52,650
I've met Richard Stallman and and on

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,800
numerous occasions had the pleasure to

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:58,590
meet Lina's and I have to say that I

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,590
think Lina's is a most extraordinary

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,810
leader in terms of his clarity of focus

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,960
on what's important and and what's not

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:10,440
it's kind of incredible to me that the

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,270
colonel has so consistently presented or

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,060
has presented such a consistent set of

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:17,520
interfaces to to use a space and that's

00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,290
really what enables us to innovate so

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,090
much because we can count on the colonel

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,950
essentially maintaining compatibility

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,800
and being really thoughtful about the

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,480
way they present that that interface

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,290
it's really important I think that the

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,190
underlying stacks and be very committed

00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:37,110
to that and platform stability just as

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,660
we're committed in our LTS releases to

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:43,070
stability of the of the use of space as

00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,930
well and so you know they're all

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,510
characters and interesting people I'm

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,470
sorry I never met Steve Jobs I I believe

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:55,880
him to have been profoundly thoughtful

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,880
and insightful person to

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,140
so Hagen is asking specifically when it

00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,810
comes to gaming with convergence as a

00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,790
goal do you see devices that would have

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:12,700
a dog that would have more graphics

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:14,290
capability or more disk space etc well

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,370
of course they're going to be it's an

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:20,670
interesting question there are going to

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:23,230
be edges of the spectrum where the

00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,240
capacity required or the specialist

00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,920
capabilities required force you to a

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:32,230
particular form factor right so you know

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,270
I think it's highly likely that i can

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,610
carry in my pocket all of the

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,310
functionality i need for lightweight

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,690
productivity and as long as i can get to

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,700
a form factor which lets me be

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,100
productive right i think it's highly

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:48,220
unlikely you know in the short term that

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,190
i'll carry in my pocket and the beefiest

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,170
meatiest biggest baddest workstation

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,730
capability right go simultaneous time

00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,160
what I carry in my pocket will seem to

00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:58,900
us like today to be an unbelievable

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,070
amount of computing power but at any

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,340
given time you're going to be able to

00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:05,140
fit more beef into a workstation a

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,450
desktop workstation then you are going

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,280
to be able to fit into your pocket so I

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,740
think there's a visit this there's

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,080
always going to be room for not just all

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,570
the form factors but also devices that

00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,670
are dedicated for for example

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,560
workstations and so on and gaming and

00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,620
but that doesn't mean that you can't

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,150
that we can't it you know cover a huge

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,310
amount of what the average person needs

00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,170
most days of the week and in fact

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,210
certainly for all of their like great

00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,950
personal computing needs and with

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,660
something that fits in their pocket if

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,420
you think of the fact that we're putting

00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:41,560
1.8 giga hertz atom chips into phones

00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:43,330
today which are which are you know every

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,830
bit as powerful as the laptops that all

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:48,280
the bunch of developers were running

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:51,130
full time and when we started that's

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,630
that's pretty incredible and we should

00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,300
we should riff on that we should make

00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,860
the platforms and as fun and as easy to

00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:05,440
use in those environments and

00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:09,380
environments as possible okay

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,460
so the extra 099 is asking you mentioned

00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:15,230
free and clean / more for many devices

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,480
are they also going to be open source

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,700
are you going to try and convince

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,339
convince manufacturers or do you have a

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:26,960
solid reverse engineering team on the

00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:30,190
tracks well we've always seen a very

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,050
wide spectrum of devices in a very wide

00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,099
spectrum of philosophies about how you

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,830
know the device and the user should

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,740
interact and I really don't worry about

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:42,589
that too much because I think as long as

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:46,369
we present a platform which is available

00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:48,940
as a free platform the apps will come to

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,530
the platform you know in a world where

00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,750
devices fragment the landscape you know

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,369
if you think of a tivo device you know

00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,260
that's the tivo device that's the only

00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,510
way you can get that device it's kind of

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,970
locked down and that's a problem by any

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,490
interesting app on that device is only

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,750
available on that device well I suspect

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,270
what's going to happen is that we can

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,740
open up the platform so all the

00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,530
interesting applications are available

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,210
on many devices and at that stage you'll

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,460
have your choice of devices which are

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,740
themselves more open or less open I

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,720
think it's an important issue but I also

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,220
don't think it's the most important

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,750
issue because people always tend to find

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,680
a way to work around that sort of

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,780
constraint or restriction and and and I

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,300
think that's healthy so we will support

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,650
a full range of business models will

00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,119
support working with people who've

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,670
locked their devices and people who

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,380
insist that their devices are open our

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,970
goal is to try to create an open

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,190
platform for developers and their

00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:47,720
applications and I think in history it's

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,220
always been the case that the open

00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,070
platforms are the ones that have grown

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,910
and thrived so we'll let that dynamic

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,910
take care of itself

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:05,690
alright please asking does this mean

00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,880
that I can run multiple versions of snap

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,850
packaged applications at the same time

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,620
can I indeed roll them back do all snap

00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:15,170
packaged applications benefit from this

00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:18,980
for example LibreOffice monodevelop cute

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:22,190
designer etc that's exactly right you

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:25,310
can and install multiple versions of a

00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,260
snap and then switch between them and so

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,880
you can have an experimental one and a

00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,440
stable one and experimental one on a

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,860
stable one and you can switch between

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,740
them with a single command and the data

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:40,670
is backed up or should be backed up each

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,320
time you do that so that you you you

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,210
have a perfect roll back if things don't

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,650
work and over time we've aired we'll add

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,900
the ability for the software to test

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,670
itself so that the rollback is automatic

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:55,070
if the upgrade effectively caused a

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:56,990
problem and the the the there are lots

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,490
of cool challenges now in terms of

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,800
getting snaps of things like Libre

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,300
Office we would really like them so if

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,890
if that's something that you're

00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,010
interested please climb into the snap

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,990
you list and the next version of the

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,750
phone platform will be snappy as well

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,960
click was the first generation of snappy

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,220
effectively so the phone and the

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,870
Internet of Things platforms are all

00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,630
going to be snappy they'll all use the

00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:23,180
same kernels and the difference is just

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,070
in the OS blob right so the personal OS

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,070
blob is the one that can handle phones

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,410
and tablets and PCs and the core OS blob

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,760
is the one that's designed for

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:38,390
distributed devices like Wi-Fi access

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:41,030
points or switches or reaches the next

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,770
question holy again um how do you feel

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,570
now that Microsoft has basically

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:49,370
validated Canonical's approach in

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:50,660
regards to convergence I am very proud

00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,690
of the fact that is a free software

00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,280
community we have placed free software

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,800
right at the front of the evolution of

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,990
personal computing you know I've been

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,340
part of Linux for many many years Linux

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,020
has been part of my life for many many

00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,120
years there was always a lot of whining

00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,310
and complaining about you know the you

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,500
know reasons why linux didn't succeed

00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,480
but I think part of that was that we

00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,110
were always copying the other guy right

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,180
we were

00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,390
five years ten years behind and copying

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:22,130
the other guy broadly here for the first

00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:24,110
time profoundly we had this vision right

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,580
at the same time I think it's hard to

00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,900
speculate as to whether we had first

00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,670
they had at first I don't think it

00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,070
matters right I think we're actually

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,550
living in a world where if we are

00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:36,470
sincere and generous and we make a great

00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,360
experience actually all the applications

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,400
which run on a Windows converged

00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,170
environment might also run on in a bun

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,520
to conversion environment and I think

00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,840
that might be perfectly good for

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,210
Microsoft too because the business

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,790
models of that software are changing as

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,080
well so I'd like us to rise above kind

00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,090
of saying well you know you're copying

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,540
our ideas well we didn't pack with those

00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,820
ideas right we we want people we spoke

00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,070
very publicly about that vision because

00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,230
we wanted it to be true and I think it's

00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,480
exciting for everybody that that vision

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,670
is coming true of course I'd like us to

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,220
be out there first we are going to ship

00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,530
a convergence device and you can be part

00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,180
of shaping that soft the software that's

00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,510
on it and the experience of the device

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,950
itself you can do that for with with

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,620
ubuntu you won't be able to do that I

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,330
don't think with windows and and so

00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,420
that's an opportunity for you to define

00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:28,490
the future right at the front so thank

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:33,830
you for the question and let's get

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:36,260
cracking all right so one question to

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,360
summarize macula question thing that on

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,790
that similar topic what was the reason

00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,400
behind the name and really ripe an

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:46,070
alliterative blog post us as usual

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:50,630
that's the name behind the Google to add

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:55,970
value and I have written a blog post and

00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:58,130
it is scheduled to be live but it's not

00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,110
live yet maybe I got the date wrong in

00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,790
my wordpress instance let me go and

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:09,320
publish that right away thank you good

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:11,990
catch excellent all right next one is

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,880
from Joe Ireland if someone comes up

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,070
with an idea for phone hardware that's

00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,200
specifically useful for converge phones

00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:22,550
would you be willing to give able to

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,660
economical and could you just ask that

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,960
question again David's area and I was in

00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,420
middle lower lip alright so that's from

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,430
Joe Allen if someone comes up with an

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,490
idea for phone hardware that's

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:36,869
specifically useful for converge phones

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:42,299
would you be willing to give the 12 inch

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:44,250
an hour ago yes I think so I mean the

00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:49,970
vision behind the edge was really to

00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:53,039
create an aspirational platform a to sit

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,750
to to give manufacturers a reason to go

00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,250
for the very very high end you know we

00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,030
thought it was possible but there wasn't

00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:02,039
any real reason for just a phone to to

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,140
go for that very very high end now I

00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,329
think we start to see the real reason

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,069
I'm going to be in Korea and I'd love to

00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,750
meet guys at Samsung to talk about that

00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:11,940
because you know I think they have the

00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,859
ability to do it and if you work for

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,650
samsung then there please reach out to

00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:20,579
my office and we'll set up a meeting and

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:22,799
but I think the key thing is to now that

00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:26,309
the neither the vision is real to to

00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:28,470
work with manufacturers who will make

00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:30,180
great devices our focus has to stay on

00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,180
the software and I'm quite glad actually

00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,920
that when when we didn't raise

00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,750
everything we needed to raise for the

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,309
edge we raised enough to raise attention

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,720
right people started to think oh that's

00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:42,089
very interesting but we didn't raise

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,920
enough to do it the result of that is

00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:45,920
that we've had our attention one hundred

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,150
percent on the software since then and

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,890
and so that's why right now on my

00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,900
desktop right here if I log out and log

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,609
back in again I can log into unity 8 and

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,710
I can get a desktop experience on on

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:57,210
this laptop that I'm on right here with

00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,000
unity ate the same unity a that's

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:03,240
shipping on the the BQ aquarius right so

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,440
that's kind of fantastic and so yes I

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,299
would be willing to give the edge ago I

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,000
would like to have a hero device we have

00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:11,789
made a commitment to ship a device which

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,289
has this capability and but I think it

00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,970
would be interesting to explore doing

00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,680
you know shooting for the moon and

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,470
having the most powerful possible device

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,579
in your pocket and making that in a

00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:25,130
buncha device and making it a

00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:28,980
convergence device at that all right

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:31,349
next question from Nelly how do you see

00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,089
juju and things like kubernetes working

00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:37,319
together are they more or less in the

00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:40,019
same space and that's a great question

00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:43,920
they're at different levels so we deploy

00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:48,569
for example we deploy and Cuban 80s

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:55,619
today I showed you the bundle picture

00:43:48,569 --> 00:44:01,759
let me see if I can find it again this

00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:05,400
is Cuban eighties if I just share that

00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:07,079
this is the Juju's service model of

00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,459
Cuban eighties and you can see what it's

00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,949
essentially doing is it's linking

00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:13,410
together docker itself which would go on

00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:15,319
to all the machines and provide you with

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,459
the hosting for the docker processes

00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,999
Flamel annette CD which would

00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:22,319
essentially create a overlay network of

00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:24,449
addresses for all of those Dhaka

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,239
processes and in the Cuban eighties

00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:29,099
control and coordination system which

00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:31,709
essentially structures the Cuban AG's

00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:33,809
model now kooban 80s is really really

00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:36,449
good together with some of the other

00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:40,289
docker control systems like Diego from

00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:42,930
pivotal or docker itself and this see if

00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:45,119
i can find this version yeah this is dr.

00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,599
itself effectively those are really good

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,819
at running docker containers and and

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,309
while due to will let you manage docker

00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:55,049
containers and it's more focused on the

00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:58,739
underlying infrastructure the software

00:44:55,049 --> 00:45:00,269
that you install on on machines so if

00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,469
you're installing software on machines

00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:03,719
then you probably want to be using a

00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:05,759
charm and juju if you are running the

00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,079
same copy of software and you want

00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:09,119
developers to essentially be able to

00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,009
commit an image that gets run at scale

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,289
then you want something based on Darkar

00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:15,089
of which Cuban 80s is a very good one so

00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:16,469
they while they're similar they kind of

00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,969
work well together we would be

00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:19,769
interested in laying down the base

00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:21,479
infrastructure taking all of the

00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:24,089
machines and putting cuban 80s on there

00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:26,809
integrating nagios integrating all the

00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:29,699
various components and that you might

00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:31,650
want to run on the bare metal or in the

00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:33,690
VMS and then cuban eighties would

00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,390
present an API often to a different set

00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,279
of developers for all the containers and

00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,759
stuff the docker process containers that

00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:45,019
they want to run and on top of that

00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,019
infrastructure does that make sense

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,880
there are a bit of a delay the entire

00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:56,930
sea and that will be watching it for the

00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:03,560
answer all right um next question next

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:05,480
question from D to KX report coming

00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,540
updates for voodoo snappy on the

00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,810
Raspberry Pi to the huge opportunity

00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:15,530
because it's a popular platform and has

00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:17,330
been linked a lot to be desired so

00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,880
snappy will definitely be available on

00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:22,220
the r pi 2 there is in fact a community

00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,080
contribute contributed kernel for the

00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:28,700
our PI to which i think will well

00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:32,090
improve over time and the default 32-bit

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,500
arm kernel that we publish also works on

00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,260
a couple of other platforms like the

00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:39,050
BeagleBone black and the dsr pi is

00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,910
pretty fantastic where we're glad to

00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,130
have a community contributed kernel for

00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:46,070
it and looking forward to working with

00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:56,090
the manufacturer to get full support for

00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:58,160
the r pi 2 into snappy and casper SW is

00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,730
asking will canonical give the best of

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,130
and desktop applications and futures

00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:06,560
sorry features more let me just restart

00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,360
again sorry so we'll canonical give the

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,300
desktop and desktop applications and

00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,410
features more off this new cycle

00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,480
supporting server independent of rice

00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:19,250
type is good but the desktop the best of

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,690
user feel left out well a desktop focus

00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,210
at the moment very much is on the

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,740
convergence story right we really care

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,530
about the desktop in fact for spending a

00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,230
lot on the desktop but our existing

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:32,180
desktop won't converge it can't run in a

00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:36,230
fern type environment the new desktop

00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,880
and is run by the phone and so what

00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,400
we've done is we've essentially i think

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,740
finalized the call layout of the desktop

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,870
and what we're now doing is implementing

00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,720
that that that desktop experience that

00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,920
you see in unity 7 in unity eight so

00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,870
that if the if you're really interested

00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,550
in that then please join us the unity 8

00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,650
community is super open they're lovely

00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:58,130
community lots of discussions about bugs

00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:00,200
and features and ways to implement

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,680
things how to optimize things for

00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,470
different place

00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,240
forms form factors and I know they would

00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,940
appreciate your your support in your

00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,250
contributions the faster we get unity 8

00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,579
to be out there and great as a desktop

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,380
the faster you'll see real progress so

00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:16,730
for me it's delicious and great that

00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,069
there are lots of desktop environments

00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,470
on linux and but i think the big

00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:24,550
contribution we can make is to is to is

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,230
to pioneer this convergence story and

00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:29,180
and we'd love to have your help in there

00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:33,710
bringing applications as snaps to the

00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:35,990
phone and essentially gets us converged

00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,390
desk top stories and i think you'll find

00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,400
that the new unity 8 the infrastructure

00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,040
underneath it is much cleaner than the

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,540
old linux desktop right we've blown away

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,640
a lot of the stuff that's been there for

00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:49,250
30 years and is really not very pretty

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,930
under the hood and and replace it with

00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,490
something sort of a set of stacks that

00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,430
are very clearly clean clear

00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:58,160
well-thought-out easy to work with and

00:48:54,430 --> 00:49:03,170
reliable and fast so so let's build that

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:05,030
desktop together that's all yeah the

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,089
remember I want to join the convergence

00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:10,280
and u t8 and snappy sessions at Summit

00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:12,079
total Condor squirrel all of them and

00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:16,819
it's going to be really exciting us in

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,890
that regard alright so we've got about

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:23,750
eight minutes left I'm going to pick the

00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:25,670
next question from ham hands lie will

00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:30,410
give it the egg be the default LTS

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:33,200
desktop for 1604 yeah and unity eight

00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:35,960
will be an option for 1604 and and we

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:44,780
let the community decide the default 460

00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:47,150
natural all right and Aquila is asking

00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:53,839
what's your favorite click up on the

00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:58,190
phone and I find find 2048 and you know

00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:01,160
terribly compulsively addictive and so I

00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:03,020
enjoy that and then I also enjoy and one

00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,660
of the news reading apps where I kind of

00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,170
keep track of and bits and pieces and

00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,970
and I often use Google+ through the

00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,750
through the web app interface to google

00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,750
plus as well

00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:22,309
well I'm all I'm missing is chrome an

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:24,230
IRC client and a terminal and Anna mail

00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:28,010
client and then unity 8 is my whole

00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:30,559
desktop so and let's get cracking right

00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:34,520
I've seen some compelling demos but I

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:39,349
really want the real thing and so on all

00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:42,710
right um Smith is asking what do you

00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:45,910
think all the hollow lens well I think

00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,910
that's another really interesting

00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,450
perspective on the eve continued

00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,520
evolution of personal computing right

00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,250
and the important thing to realize is

00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,440
the disruption is never dat you know

00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:02,480
it's easy to look back and say are you

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,890
know such-and-such one but the reality

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,390
is the world keeps disrupting itself and

00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,040
and writing the word those waves of

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,230
disruption is very very interesting I

00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,240
think having a converged platform is our

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,460
most important story because it will

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,160
allow us to springboard into some of

00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,319
those newer areas as well but right now

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,540
the focus has got to be let's nail the

00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:25,250
combination the phone tablet and PC what

00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,920
we have is pretty incredible you know

00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:30,380
it's much more usable i think in its

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,079
design than any other convergence story

00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,359
i've seen and it's real convergence

00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:37,339
unlike the Apple approach of kind of

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,720
handoff between two platforms while

00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:41,390
that's interesting it's not real

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,240
convergence and we've got it we've got

00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,190
it we lead it we should we should race

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,750
as hard as we can pedal as fast as we

00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:52,910
can to bring that home okay should

00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:54,740
quickly say that our ? Lacasse was from

00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,780
just characters did you just do pointed

00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,780
that and I arcing from iris in a tequila

00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,480
sorry for the confusion so next question

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,869
from my zone and could snuggling her

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,990
rolling release possible yes snappy is a

00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:11,660
rolling release so in snappy we

00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,240
disconnect the devel tree from the

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,099
stable trees and so you're either on the

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,410
devil tree or you're on one of the

00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:20,390
stable trees and that if you're on the

00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:24,520
devil tree then you keep rolling so snap

00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,520
peas are rolling is a rolling above to

00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:31,600
Howard is asking any brings them an

00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:34,210
actress working with snapping yes in

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,820
fact we have had conversations where

00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:39,160
we've printer manufacturers have have

00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,680
called us to ask about snappy which is

00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,950
exciting but I've no product to announce

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,290
in that regard right now but it's kind

00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:49,030
of cool refrigerators on snappy they've

00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,770
been printed conversations networking

00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,940
equipment conversations so I think

00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,400
that's really exciting we're really

00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:57,010
enabling those companies and those teams

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,600
to kind of focus on their applications

00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,710
focus on what makes them great if I

00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,080
think of how difficult it must be for

00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,090
the dd-wrt community right they've got

00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,070
to do all the layers in the stack from

00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:08,770
the colonel and the baseboard and the

00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:10,300
SOC all the way up to making a great

00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,820
user experience for people to manage

00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,670
routing and switching of DNS and VPNs

00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,020
and things like that and I think if if

00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,760
members of that community interested in

00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,040
making a snap we can accelerate

00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,110
everything they do because then we

00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,790
already take care of getting the getting

00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,830
the platform sorted out getting on and

00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,660
off the hardware handling updates and so

00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,030
on and it's extensible right they can

00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,310
they can have other applications sitting

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:36,610
right next to them and allowing each of

00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:43,210
those communities to focus and and go

00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:45,460
faster okay and then um table is asking

00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,860
are we going to see big names of apps

00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:51,630
coming to boone to touch such as the

00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:58,870
likes of what's up Netflix I player etc

00:53:51,630 --> 00:54:04,300
yes television the answer is yes all

00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:06,250
right all right we've got a really long

00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,170
formulated question but i think i'm just

00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,300
going to read the summary so what's your

00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,390
stance on bounties for software

00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:17,350
development that's interesting you know

00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:20,220
I I tried I tried this approach a number

00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:23,980
of occasions I once wrote to the

00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:27,400
developers of a very famous a piece of

00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:30,760
free software for editing images with a

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,860
with an offer of a bounty and got a very

00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,260
pointed response back that developers

00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,460
don't work for money which was fine it

00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,710
was it was a little rude the response

00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,780
if there was a fair point that's fine

00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:44,390
and there are some great research on the

00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,220
awkward intersection of volunteer work

00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,109
and paid work you know there's some

00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,450
great research social science research

00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:52,310
on how you can really mess things up in

00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,010
a functioning community of volunteers

00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:57,260
you start adding money especially money

00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:59,060
for some people and not others but

00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,890
basically I think it's a good idea and

00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,320
I've never managed to figure out how to

00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:05,839
do it we've tried I tried I tried

00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,180
funding work to add a bounty capability

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:10,099
to bugzilla I we tried doing this in

00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,170
launchpad but we just never managed to

00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:14,990
get the hang of it at the end of the day

00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,310
the problem I saw was that was that it

00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,960
wasn't just enough to create the

00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,480
software you actually need upstream to

00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:23,780
care about that right otherwise it's

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,690
sort of rots and that's a more difficult

00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,849
social problem to figure out I do think

00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,130
that we have to fix the business models

00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:34,490
associated with with free software you

00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:36,530
know today it's too easy for a support

00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:39,080
contract for free software to be

00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:42,020
essentially like a blank check across

00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,570
all software to one company with vets

00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:46,630
canonical Red Hat and then it's at the

00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:48,890
discretion of that company what they

00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:51,470
what they give to different upstream

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:54,140
communities right and often i think that

00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:56,839
discretion is poorly exercised we for

00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,430
example we send a portion of all the

00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:01,190
revenue that we earn through firefox

00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:02,839
browser back to Mozilla and it's a very

00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,609
carefully you know we have a formula for

00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:07,130
how we calculate that and we do it

00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:11,270
regardless and I'd like to do that for

00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:13,730
more pieces of software and I think that

00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:15,859
might be a better way to to figure out

00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,869
how to get people paid full time to work

00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:20,770
on the wonderful upstream projects that

00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:24,680
that make free software project three

00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:27,500
possible and I think bounties while

00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,450
interesting tend to be a little one off

00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,099
and so they're difficult for people to

00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:33,770
build a career around difficult for

00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,990
people to build a life around and so

00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,820
ultimately sort of unsatisfied but I

00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,560
might just have not got it right yet so

00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:44,060
keep you know if you're interested keep

00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:46,220
trying alright so another question and

00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,410
renewing the end that what do you think

00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:50,360
about Wayland

00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:55,060
well and I think it's a perfectly good

00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:57,790
piece of software I think our values

00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:59,990
including convergence and other

00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,850
priorities was such that it was

00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,280
important for us to support the team

00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:07,910
that wanted to build a crisper cleaner

00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,470
smaller more tightly specified graphics

00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:12,350
display engine and I'm very proud of the

00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,180
fact that we've done it and I think we

00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,740
have a bad habit in the free software

00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,060
world of not being able to tell the

00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:20,930
difference between freedom to innovate

00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:23,840
and and a pissing contest right there

00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:26,620
are many many occasions where canonical

00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:30,110
has adopted other people's software or

00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:32,180
created new software and then adopted

00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,940
other people software or or the other

00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:38,330
way around right and you won't have any

00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:40,400
of that dynamic innovation if you

00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,250
criticize people from thinking that it's

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,960
appropriate for them to go and do and

00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,910
something slightly different I will also

00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,110
say that if we're going to have a big

00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,520
controversy we should keep the

00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,650
controversy to the things that matter

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,840
and there are about five people in the

00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,050
whole world who need to know what the

00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,640
particular display layer is because app

00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:01,100
developers don't know or care right

00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,140
that's all abstracted by toolkit so I do

00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:07,220
find an unfortunate example of a place

00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:09,710
where um politics fired rivalry and so

00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:13,190
on have been allowed to create nastiness

00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:16,430
and and and bad feeling for nothing

00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:19,100
right over nothing we upgraded to system

00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:21,130
d which was a huge change huge change we

00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,450
did that graciously and we did that

00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:27,710
invisibly right did anybody even notice

00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:29,630
when they upgraded from 14 10 to 15 or

00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:32,120
for that they got systemd I suspect not

00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:34,160
most people didn't write that was an

00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,260
enormous amount of work I think we can

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,030
expect other communities to be as

00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,040
gracious about the things that we choose

00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:41,900
to innovate on as well especially when

00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:47,300
they're of much smaller more tightly

00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:49,910
scoped significance all right then I

00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:53,030
think with this um with rich at the end

00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:56,240
of the session we still got a few

00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:58,280
questions but we've tried to pick a good

00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,980
mix of topics and a good mix of

00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,480
different people who are there questions

00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:04,700
however there still

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,530
whole sign to start this week and I'm

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,030
sure you have the opportunity to ask

00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:10,369
these questions either in sessions are

00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:14,510
also i would encourage you to join the

00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:17,810
session on wednesday at 1700 UTC with

00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:20,060
Jane Silber the CEO of YouTube could go

00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:24,109
to and also be able to answer all these

00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:26,840
questions and think with this I'll thank

00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:29,000
everyone to further interesting

00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,790
questions thank you Mark for joining in

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
for the for the keynote and also for

00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:37,760
taking everyone's questions and also say

00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,300
i'll see you tomorrow at the summit same

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,940
time thank you very much David for

00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,070
hosting us the Barcelona Singapore and

00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:48,560
the rest of the world it's been great to

00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:51,380
have this conversation and have a

00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,820
wonderful online summit it's it's

00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,560
amazing the sort of diversity of

00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,560
perspectives that come together and I

00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:01,220
think that's part of why the the end

00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:05,630
result is so great every six months so

01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,130
