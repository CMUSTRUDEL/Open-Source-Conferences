also spend some time this week

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,719

version the vivid burbot we put a lot of

00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,710
work into that there's some cool new

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,590
features on the desktop on the server

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,130
and of course on the phones so we'll be

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,139
showcasing some of that as well the

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,200
summit itself is split up into multiple

00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:32,329
sessions by topic that you've got an app

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,759
in scope development topic you've got a

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,399
cloud core where we're going to talk

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,590
about more of the underlying bits that

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,649
are common across everything that uses a

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,090
bun to we have a new convergence topic

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,310
this time around which is obviously

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,659
important to us as we are going to one

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,880
code base for all of our different

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,009
devices and of course we've got a

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,319
community track as always for anything

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,229
related to a bunch of community

00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,499
community teams and growth and advocacy

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,420
on that end we also have a new show

00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:04,549
Intel track this time around which is

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,869
dedicated just to showing off things

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,639
that are cool and interesting that

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,619
you're working on so we've got a bunch

00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:12,500
of demos on there that people are going

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,790
to show some walkthroughs where they'll

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,130
teach you how to do certain things with

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,130
the bun

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,750

interesting things every one of these

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,930
tracks has multiple track leads they're

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,880
a combination of people from canonical

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,190
and people from the community and they

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,650

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,150
set up with a session if you're hosting

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,670
a session they can walk you through that

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,990
if you are just participating they can

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,120
tell you what you need to do to

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,370
participate effectively if you have any

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,740
technical issues with the schedule or

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,080
with the summit website go find one of

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,950
those they are listed on the website

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,770
itself summit upon 2.com / u OS hyphen

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,990
15 05 / tracks so that link right down

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,790
there at the bottom of the slide that

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,100
will list everybody by track who you can

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,100
contact to get any help that you need

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,410
the online summit is a community event

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,390
we do this for you as much as for us and

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,670
we want you to be involved in it as much

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,230
as we are so the first thing that you

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,180
should do is you should register and

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,070
summit if you go to summit Dada bun to

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,190
calm you'll see a big register link

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,290
there that tells us that you're not only

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,000
participating but it lets you build your

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,710
own schedule too so you can go through

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,850
the list of sessions that are coming up

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,800
you can mark the ones that you're

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,450
interested in attending and then you'll

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,610
get a nice view of your personal

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,170
schedule so that you always know you

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,330
know what you wanted to attend in the

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,680
next hour you don't have to go back to

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,930
the schedule and browse to and try and

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,850
figure that out so if you want to take a

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,650
few minutes after this plenary is done

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,540
and go through the schedule and mark

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,990
your sessions that you want to attend

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,250
that would be a good use of your time

00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,290
promote any sessions that you think are

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,750
interesting the more people that we have

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,490
viewing them and participating in them

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,530
the more useful they're going to be to

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,180
everybody so if there's something that

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,550
you're interested in and you plan on

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,709
attending go ahead and promote that on

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,990
facebook on Twitter on Google+ wherever

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,720
you want to to get more people involved

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,830
in that and most importantly is we

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,140
really want you to join these

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,900
conversations this is not just something

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,970
for you to come and watch and you listen

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,840
to and not be a part if we want you to

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,310
be

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,780
involved in the discussion we want to

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,639
get your thoughts and your opinions if

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,930
you've got a idea of a better way to

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,180
implement something that nobody's

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,639
talking about bring it up and explain it

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,919
and most importantly we want you to take

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,169
work items out of this ubuntu is a

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,120
community developed this dro that means

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:48,090
we need community people to be working

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,590
on it also if you are new don't worry

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,850
there's a lot of small tasks that you

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,340
can do almost every session has

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,410
something really easy like email

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,690
somebody or create a wiki page things

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,699
that don't really require any experience

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,440
or a whole lot of technical skills to do

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,510
but they're important things to get done

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,310
so take a work item for one of those

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,010
it's a great way to start getting

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,350
involved in helping a bunt too I've

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,960
mentioned the summit website a couple of

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,060
times this is the main tool for the

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,700
online summit everything that we do is

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,020
going to happen here you'll see at the

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,389
bottom that we've got links where you

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,090
can view the schedule by date by track

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,520
or even by room every room is going to

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,620
correspond to an IRC channel they will

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,360
be embedded inside the summit webpage

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,889
but if you have your own IRC client you

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,990
want to use you can use that to they're

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:38,460
all on freenode once you go into the

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,760
schedule you'll see a nice list of

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,860
what's coming up separated out by our

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,660
every track has its own code or color

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,190
code so you'll see the different colors

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,360
on the schedule you can easily pick out

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,389
the ones that you're interested in that

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,520
way if you've set up a meeting that you

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,860
want to go to you'll see a little yellow

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,750
star next to it also on this view you'll

00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,010
also notice a QR code up in the corner

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,930
that will take you to a mobile version

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,220
of the website so if you want to ski on

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,500
that with your phone and have that

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,500
easily accessible that way you can also

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,580
once you go into a session page like

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,320
this one you'll see on all of them

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,080
there's a embedded youtube video that

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,330
will play the video stream right below

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,950
that there is a embedded IRC widget

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,500
which will take you directly to the

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,240
correct IRC channel for this and then on

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,200
the side we've got an embedded etherpad

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,349
page this is a online group editing a

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,639
group editor that we use to take notes

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:37,140
around questions solutions work items

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,760
it's really helpful to have somebody in

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,200
there taking notes while other people

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,610
are discussing because a lot of times

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,960
when you in the middle of a conversation

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,060
you don't think okay we need to stop and

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,830
write that down so again even if you're

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,120
not participating in the discussion if

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,740
you want to take notes in this etherpad

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,960
document that would be extremely helpful

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:57,270
also if you are running a session it's

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,439
really easy to do all you have to do is

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,840
show up a little bit early go to Google

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,780
Plus hangouts page there's a link on the

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,000
wiki wiki data buncha calm / UDS that

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,340
will walk you through this you set up

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,800
your online where you set up your on-air

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,069
hang out you get the hang out in the

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,569
YouTube URLs you put them into summit

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,180
once you start running the session it's

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,340
important to keep an eye on IRC a lot of

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,199
people can't join the video hangout or

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,060
are comfortable joining the video

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,150
hangout so IRC is going to be their main

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,099
method of participating in your session

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,810
so make sure you keep an eye on that if

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,270
people are asking questions in there be

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,819
sure to answer them on the video and

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,340
also on IRC and just make sure that they

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,770
feel as engaged as anybody who's on the

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,379
video also and encourage participation

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,539
from everybody to a lot of people are

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,839
shy they don't necessarily want to join

00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,190
in right away but if you ask them their

00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,650
thoughts and opinions you try and get

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,150
them to join the conversation people

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,949
will open up and get more involved out

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,690
by and that makes everything better for

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,479
the session and for the work that gets

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,740
done afterwards and again if you need

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,469
any help while you're setting up these

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,810
sessions something's not working you

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,400
have a question about how to do it go

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,960
find one of those track leads and they

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,949
will be able to explain it to you and

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,060
help you out if you are not running a

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,770
session but you are participating

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,900
there's also some things that you need

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,569
to do I'd mentioned before this is not

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,849
just for spectators we don't want you to

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,800
just sit around and have a one-way

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,479
stream of information coming from us to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
you we want to get information from you

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,339
also we want your involvement so in

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,320
addition to watching the video make sure

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,269
that you do join that IRC channel and

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,760
the conversations that are going on on

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,990
there if you feel comfortable with it

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,910
and you have something to add to the

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,490
conversation then join the hangout also

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,250
it's a lot easier to talk directly to

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,600
other people on the video than it is to

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,889
go back and forth between video and IRC

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,559
in

00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,089
with the presenters the biggest fear

00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,499
most presenters have is that they're

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,239
going to go in there and nobody's going

00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,220
to talk to them so make sure you talking

00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:06,980
to them you're asking them questions

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,480
you're giving them your thoughts and

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,059
opinions it really helped everything

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,069
move along again take notes in the

00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:15,619
etherpad this is going to be kind of our

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:18,439
permanent record of what needs to be

00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:20,269
done after these three days so note

00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:22,399
everything down and there so it doesn't

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,839
get forgotten and of course most

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,029
importantly volunteer for some work

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,079
items again it's a great way to get

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:32,329
started in a bun to it's very rewarding

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,220
we have some key sessions going on we've

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,879
got this one right now the opening

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,579

do a live Q&A session so if you have any

00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,509
questions about the canonical as a

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,769
company or how canonical works with a

00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,480
bun to and the rest of the open source

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,889
community that would be a good time to

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,379
come and bring those questions and ask

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,410

and give an overview of the highlights

00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:08,239
from the previous three days for each

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,279
track this is really helpful so you can

00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:11,540
go back and decide okay these are the

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,149

sessions going on these next three days

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,369
that you might want to be involved in

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,419
the community team has a QA that's

00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:31,699

charms for the cloud there be people

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,439
there who can help you with that on

00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:50,329
Thursday we've got a bunch of client Q&A

00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,399
where we're going to be taking any

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,139
questions involving the desktop or the

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,799
phone and how we're going to converge

00:10:54,139 --> 00:11:01,039
those two together so that's at 1400 UTC

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,660
after that there's an SDK team GPA for

00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,129
any app developers who want to pick the

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,069
brains of the guys who are making the

00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,750
tools and the AP is that you use we have

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,460
a community council q

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,200
na later in the day so if you have any

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,000
questions for the main governance body

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,460
of a bun to you can come there and ask

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,440
that and then finally we've got a snappy

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,940
q a snappy is a pretty new thing I know

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,800
a lot of people have questions on that

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,720
that's a good time to go get it answered

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,700
that's a lot of stuff going on there's a

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,700
lot of sessions going on you OS can be

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,370
kind of a stressful very fast-paced time

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,860
so do try and relax you don't have to

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,210
get to all of these sessions it's not

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,100
like Pokemon you don't gotta catch them

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,990
all all the videos are going to be

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,750
recorded you can go back to the summit

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:48,800
web page at any time and re-watch the

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,810
video the IRC is recorded it's on IRC

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,690
logs that ubuntu com so if there's any

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,540
link source details that are posted into

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,070
IRC those are going to be available for

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,380
you also to go back and get that and

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,910
then again the ether pads permanent

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,500
thing so anything that gets written down

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,000
in the ether pads is going to be around

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,440
forever for you to come back and get to

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,050
so that's the basics of how to

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,790
participate this week the most important

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,520
thing again though is you making this

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,650
happen however involved you are is going

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,730
to affect the value that you get out of

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,380
this and the more people who are

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,540
involved the more value everyone's going

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,770
to get out of it so be active be

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,930
involved be engaged help us promote it

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:34,280
alright and that's it for me so now i

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:36,650
will stop screen sharing and i will hand

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,140
it over to Rick Spencer who's going to

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,080
give the actual opening keynotes for us

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:47,030
along with the Alexander sack Ali and

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:51,260
Robbie thanks Michael I'm going to

00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:53,839
continue the tradition of just saying

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,910
some personal sharing some personal

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,280
thoughts that I have about a boon to

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,320
what we just accomplished where we're

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:05,210
going but this time I'm going to leave

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,490
the setting the stage for the next six

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,970
months to some other folks so I just

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,990
have a few quick things to share so let

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,990
me turn on screen sharing

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:28,670
okay so first wow we just we just got

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,070
this guy out the 1504 so I think part of

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,050
the Abboud to online summit is that we

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,290
like to celebrate what just came before

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:39,680
what we just accomplished some of you

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:42,589
may know that I actually have a soft

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,930
spot in my heart for monkeys I've always

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:49,220
just found them inherently amusing and

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,300
endearing so that made this a particular

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,579
coincidence that made this a

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:59,899
particularly nice release for me on the

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:01,610
desktop and other areas but on a more

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:07,130
serious note it was really things like

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:10,190
this that made 1504 a great experience

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,200
was seeing the different communities

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,700
form or continue their existing work

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,310
this is really a shout out to boon to

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,870
mate who joined as an official flavor

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:29,060
realize their vision within the abou to

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:32,420
community brought in new users and this

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,190
is always just a really great part of

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,350
using working in a boon to this is what

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:42,380
keeps me coming back release after

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:45,709
release is getting to to share with

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,690
people who are participating a community

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,510
and people who are realizing their

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,180
vision within the blue tube but of

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:59,690
course anyone who follows me knows that

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,370
releasing the phone was a big big thing

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,250
for me I don't know if everyone knows

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,510
I've actually been dogfooding ubuntu as

00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:12,279
my only phone since the spring of 2013

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:14,870
so when we turned around and shipped

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,550
real phones with the boon to pre-install

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:24,260
to the real like end users people who

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:29,240
bought those phones was a really amazing

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,600
time for me and a lot of people first of

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,670
all I

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,050
like BQ was an amazing company to work

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,040
with through this they were like a great

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:40,279
partner to us great feedback but make no

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,610
mistake there is no way that the phone

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,350
would have shipped if we weren't a

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,410
community open source distro there's

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:51,769
simply no way and it's it's just

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,509
numerically factual and so there's a

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:55,850
couple points that I picked out where I

00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:57,829
could talk about that but working with

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,850
the community to ship this phone was

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:06,259
just incredibly delightful so one area

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:08,449
where you can see the that it was a

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:11,269
community open source distro was on the

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,920
car apps project not everyone knows but

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:15,259
a lot of the apps that pre-installed

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,410
come pre-installed on the phone we're

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:20,959
written by community members in fact as

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,569
you can see there's like 150 people who

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,329
contributed to the 10 apps that come

00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:29,240
pre-installed on the phone and there was

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:32,720
about 15 people who are just there month

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,910
after month week after week working on

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,579
the code writing the tests giving

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,790
feedback to the SDK team updating the

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,970
code working with design to like iterate

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,370
on the experience over and over again

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,870
this is one of the nicest group of

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,180
people that I've ever worked with I've

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,509
met them not just online I've met a few

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,029
of them in person and this has been

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:59,899
really enriching to get to work with

00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:02,569
this sort of new emerging community on

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,850
the flip side another great example is

00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:10,039
in translation so booty has always had a

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:13,579
very I'd say passionate translations

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,789
community and making a boon to available

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:22,400
in all different languages so the phone

00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:26,030
came out and was in 35 languages like

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,530
what new platform can come out and have

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:34,429
be translated into 35 languages only a

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:37,640
platform with engaged in active

00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,559
community so they were there like month

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,470
after month week after week doing the

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,100
translations and in fact as we got you

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,980
know close

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,990
ship it's crunch time let's get this out

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,340
some of them like people in the

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,700
translations community would stay up

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:55,190
like overnight to make sure that the

00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:01,039
translations got in before we shipped

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:03,400
off images I think there's just too many

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,900
people like if I wanted to talk about

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,700
everybody who contributed in different

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,220
ways that need 10 of these slides a

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,820
hundred of these slides there's people

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,490
who who wrote promotional material

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:26,360
people who log bucks people who fix bugs

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:32,020
people who promoted boo to personally in

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:35,090
different ways people who were insiders

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,100
everything you can think of to get us to

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,679
where we were today to where we'll be

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:44,870
able to ship and to get us this

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:47,559
milestone so and next I think the next

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:51,289
milestone I'm really looking forward to

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,390
seeing uh seeing what we do there I

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:56,260
think that's actually a good segue to

00:18:53,390 --> 00:19:01,429
hand over to Alexander to talk about the

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:04,940
next six months and snappy thank you

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:06,770
Rick so um for those guys who don't know

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,659
me I'm Alex and a second I've actually

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,270
been around for quite a while and Lee

00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:14,929
went to project i joined in 2007 when

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,240
there was only a desktop um they're only

00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:19,549
in some sense it was super popular and a

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,380
joint as a Firefox maintainer but then I

00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,360
went kind of all over the place at those

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,260
times doing middleware stuff like

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,659
network manager Bluetooth and later went

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,400
on and worked on on the mobile front to

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:34,309
make a bun to a great distribution for

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,350
arm devices and then went off and worked

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,110
actually was linaro and learn a lot

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,070
about other words that are outside of

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,020
312 scope in particular about android

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,549
and when I came back I'm in the role to

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,250
lead you went to crow engineering

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,919
efforts there was a phone was basically

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,409
in full fledge going on words and I

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,990
helped basically getting the base system

00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,790
going what I found very good offers

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,770
all those times was a de bunda was never

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,510
really stuck in in one situation the

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,610
desk over super popular but at the same

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,620
time while I was basically participating

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,170
with the project we saw the server

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,210
project coming along we saw it become

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,790
super popular in the cloud both as a

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,190
guest but also has a host system and

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,110
then we had the arm community that base

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,910
the arm part with specially made it only

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,890
possible for us to create this amazing

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:26,720
phone community that we see nowadays and

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,670
as excited as I was to see all that is

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,130
growing I believe that with an able to

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,970
core and snap you in particular we

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,160
really have the next big step of 12 in

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,880
front of us and I would like to use this

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:44,330
opportunity to explain to you how what

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,300
that is how we got here and why I think

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,360
I am so excited about this so what is a

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,890
snappy thing so as a background when we

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,809
basically went back and we were looking

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,630
at new opportunities which we regular do

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,520
we were looking at the IOT market and

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,830
when we're looking around there we saw

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,140
that there was so much innovative energy

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:06,320
out there that were people building

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,360
devices based on linux in an open manner

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,460
and they were buildings things like

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,679
robots they were building home half cell

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,590
building switches so not only constraint

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,720
to IOT devices and we found that many of

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,900
those were actually using Ubuntu already

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,809
um and that was very striking an eye

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,480
opening and we basically then took a

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,520
step back and looked at what they were

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,290
doing and why they were loving it and we

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,700
found out that they they had a great

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,309
place to work with had greater

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,770
development environments lots of great

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:38,720
open source software that just worked

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,470
and that was nicely integrated and not

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,679
only for x86 but also for arm at the

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,510
same time we had the phone and we were

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,340
basically have gone through the process

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,820
to understand what does it really mean

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,429
to do an end user device that can be

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,800
productized and it can be rolled to a

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,410
millions of users and we also learned

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,150
that these this work isn't that easy I

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,610
mean getting from a distribution that is

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,890
great and has good software archives to

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,830
get to something where you can make a

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,669
custom appliance at end consumer can

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,259
consume less

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:14,749
you can update and that can have apps

00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,659
that can be distributed freely through a

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:19,820
store and a secure manner was quite

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,739
significant investment we had to do and

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,220
when we combine that with what we have

00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:27,049
seen on the on the front of devices and

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,149
innovators if we're using Ubuntu to

00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,629
build great prototypes we thought let's

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:34,970
see if you can distill all that all the

00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:36,980
together and come come out with the very

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,779
basics that are needed so and everybody

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,659
could do something like we did on the

00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:43,489
phone and that's basically what snapping

00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,249
we're going to core is about really

00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:48,499
getting those tools and those practices

00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:50,359
that we have learned on the phone and

00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:51,889
combined it with all the goodness we

00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,799
have visible to so that everybody out

00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:59,869
there can go and make their innovative

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:02,720
idea around devices and IOT a reality so

00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:06,739
let me share my slides with you and then

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,299
talk through a few things in right so

00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:10,700
the title I mean it's basically mark

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,039
made made up this word the Linux

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,899
firmware so in the end to what the crow

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,259
is very minimal and it really is a

00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:20,419
read-only system that comes with those

00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:23,480
abilities I've been needed for people to

00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,580
build on their great innovative ideas in

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,159
the form of applications and this

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,320
basically expanded the reach of ubuntu

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,899
no not only for humans or the cloud but

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,159
we will go for devices and for robots

00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:38,809
was this so in the past year we have

00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,909
been working on this vision and I think

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,309
we have come to a point where we really

00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:45,440
put something amazing together and that

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,929
concludes was concluded with the release

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,609
of snap be able to call 1504 which

00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,739
obviously it isn't a perfect thing but

00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:54,350
what we were trying to shoot for was

00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:57,679
really to get all the primitives in that

00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:00,139
I needed to to deliver the story that I

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,389
was trying to explain that there is an

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:05,840
easy building block system that people

00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:08,299
can use to deliver on their own a device

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,330
innovation on top of it so what is in

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:14,629
1504 we really put together platform

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,399
there is apps and store ecosystem

00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:18,049
enabled so everybody who starts with

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:20,659
snap you want to call they can directly

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,960
go and make use of those nice facilities

00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,059
that make up modern devices it has

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,029
build transactional updates and roll

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:30,250
backs in as primitives at the ground so

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,340
that is basically the basis that is

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,620
needed for anybody who wants to roll

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,539
large-scale products to market and once

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,700
ensure that those devices in the hand of

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:42,700
customers can stay secure without

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,529
risking to break them and we had

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,720
security sandboxes for apps and

00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:49,450
frameworks and this release in a very

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,919
generic and reusable fashion so we took

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,750
the technology we and developed on the

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,299
phone and made it available to everybody

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,039
who is trying to build any kind of those

00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:59,830
kind of devices can benefit from that

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,690
and they can have an app store where

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,120
third parties can more or less without

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,549
review upload their applications

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,740
directly and make them available to the

00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:11,620
users without a middleman without having

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,250
to go through our packaging process and

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,110
so on we also AM untangled the bot

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,789
support from the stack I think mark

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,590
explained that if you're an innovator

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,809
and you want to have have a great idea

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,760
on devices you usually have to go

00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:26,080
through all the stages of everything of

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,490
your braking system you have to make

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,230
your Colonel you have to make an

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,200
operating system you have to invent the

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,299
tools and so on but in the end then when

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,830
you almost run out of money you can

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,870
finally get to the point where you can

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,480
really implement your vision and which

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,610
is usually in the app on the App level

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,120
where your real logic if the real value

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:48,340
is so we managed to we try to untangle

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,289
the board port from the stack so that

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,630
people can contribute that independently

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:56,110
and that innovators at once ability

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,970
vices can pick that and and use it and

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,159
last but not least we really got

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,169
together and it was I'm rich have to get

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,409
to the point that we have what I call a

00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,669
device build a ready state that means we

00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:09,250
have all the building blocks together

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,549
that some people can visit you can

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,549
describe and something we call a gadget

00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,559
snap and your device what do you put on

00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:19,210
it how do you configure the parts and

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,600
pieces and make it reproducible

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:26,350
available for everyone so let's take a

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,299
look at what that means um and how this

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,039
I mean how this architecture looks like

00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,529
I don't want to go into detail here but

00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,360
I want to quickly step through the parts

00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,580
that make up a snappy system and show

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,470
you how I use that

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,600
as part of our release process to make a

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,630
nice demo of how to build an appliance

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,690
with it so if you look on the left side

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,100
of this on the screen you basically see

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,130
the at the bottom there is a crown upon

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,679
this is independent we maintain a few

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,750
crowns in the archive and make it

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,850
available for the whole ecosystem but

00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,799
this part is super easy to package and

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,960
people who have a board don't you want

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,000
to allow hackers to make use of the

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,700
development platform can also make that

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,010
available to the community on top you

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,070
see something in the snappy word that we

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,169
call an OS part and Wes snap that's

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,409
basically able to call that's where

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:20,320
basically the logics it gets and the

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:22,389
clues or the whole stack together this

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,240
includes a snappy tool itself this

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:28,450
includes the inlet service like system d

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,580
it includes up arm one and includes d

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,590
births in a few other very useful tools

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,549
but we don't put too too many things

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,529
into that because we know everyone to

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:41,080
extend the stack by adding apps and

00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,700
frameworks on top of it and on the right

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,799
the green thing you say space you see

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,120
something we call the gadget snaps

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,840
that's the place I was talking about

00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,450
where everybody can go and define how an

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,539
appliance is really composed and how the

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,519
individual parts are configured so as

00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:59,200
you get if you're assisting builder you

00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,630
would do this plus you get to something

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,720
like on the right side where we have a

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,760
guide up on the website that shows how

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,850
you can use all those primitives and

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,490
individual parts to build your own

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,350
clients and we basically and looked at

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,389
it and made something very simple which

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,519
is a webcam demo appliance it doesn't do

00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:20,230
much but it shows you how you can

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,200
construct from scratch something like

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,590
that make it reproducible ensure that

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,720
the permissions go and for accessing the

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,880
camera will go through the sandbox to

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,200
the back from demo up now highly

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,840
recommend for you guys if you're

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,580
interested in I'm doing this to look at

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,230
this guy go through it and let us know

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,820
how you like it right so that's what we

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,130
achieved so far as I want to talk a few

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,039
minutes about what is coming next and

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,020
particular what are we what are the

00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,620
highlights and the topics we are going

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,880
after

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:57,370
1604 release which is one year ahead so

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,320
I it is not super detailed and I'm not

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,930
going your details because we work in a

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,330
pretty LJ pretty edge away but we have

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,710
been thinking have been thinking and

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,870
looking at the backlogs and have just

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:12,040
build a few items that we should focus

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:14,110
on and next few months and the year so

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,780
first if you have seen the picture of

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,490
the architecture the snappy building

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,270
blocks that are that are outlined there

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,710
those are not yet or fully snap ified in

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,929
the center there snaps that are

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,240
available in the store and that they are

00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:31,360
using the same mechanism in particular

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,030
the colonel and the US are not done in

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,860
that way so that's that's a priority to

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,110
clean everything up to ensure that we

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,730
deliver a consistent story there across

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,770
the whole stack and ensure that

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,250
everything can be delivered through the

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:47,080
straw on this front the other big thing

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,300
is transactional updates we gotten to a

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,920
point that all the parts we have can be

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,050
transactionally out there and roll then

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,390
but now we have to make use of those

00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,550
primitives to ensure that this can be

00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,620
super useful for product builders the

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,780
key words or the bus words we want to

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,210
ensure a really present there for

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,660
everyone in the ecosystem who is working

00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:10,030
on snap peas and parts of snaps or whole

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,520
systems are basically cannery updates

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,530
and the ability to include health checks

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,480
in your snaps this is a pretty powerful

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,090
tool combined if you think about it

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,490
because every part can basically test

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,440
themselves if they're okay if they can

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,870
run properly and otherwise trigger

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,510
rollback if you pair that together with

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,610
during cannery style updates meaning

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,040
that you have they have the tools

00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,600
available to allow you if you want to do

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,179
a new version rollout of your

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,250
application of the system to first give

00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:41,530
it to a few people that are using

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,240
application instead of everyone this can

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,130
be a very powerful tool especially

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,980
because of the health checks were ensure

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,890
that things roll back automatically so

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,130
that's pretty exciting another thing is

00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,320
the user experience we have gone through

00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,780
pretty big exercise to create a very

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,580
crisp and clean command line experience

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,650
I'm sure if you have locked into a

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,540
stepping system you might feel that the

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,940
cinetic to itself is very nice

00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,880
use however we have been looking at that

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,610
and I think we can do more a we want to

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,440
ensure that the entry point of a system

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,570
is not the shallows at the moment but

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,040
it's something like a snappy shell that

00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,620
gives you really just the primitives

00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,290
that you need to really control your

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,050
snappy system in turn we want to bring

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,630
the confit feeling back that means bring

00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,520
something very easy for you to consume

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,430
into the snappy ecosystem that will give

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,320
you back the full Ubuntu experience that

00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,630
you're that you're used to from the

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,730
server and command line how will you

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,960
really realize it we don't know yet but

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,240
I think there will be some discussion

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,660
during this week on this topic so look

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,220
out for that another big topic for the

00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,830
next coming months and the years

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,650
definitely the developer experience so

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,030
far we've been focusing mostly on the

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,370
runtime side so how does the snappy

00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,260
system how it is constructed how does it

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,910
feel when you use it but we haven't

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,360
really looked at how do we make it very

00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,470
convenient for the whole world of

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,980
developers to make use of it and to

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:10,480
publish the apps very easily in general

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,060
snaps are very easy to package the

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,890
theory you just put everything into one

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,330
tree that you need to run it you bundle

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,750
all the libraries that are not on the

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,130
snappy OS part itself and then you

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,620
package it up and everything should go

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,390
but in practice it can be pretty tricky

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,730
and I think we have a one-turn

00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,100
opportunity to really ensure that

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,960
everybody who is working I'm on open

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,810
source software or also commercial

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,790
software can do so very easily what we

00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,100
envision to do there is to create a tool

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:43,210
called snap craft this tool that

00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:46,150
basically allows you to em to compose to

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,300
do reproducible builds of your software

00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:52,300
and it will include plugins that allow

00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:54,100
everybody who is already engaged in a

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,070
particular build system or source

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,980
community to em make use of that easily

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,590
so the goal is not to reinvent a new

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,510
packaging tool as we did in debian

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,060
rudras are ensure that we have something

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,860
that can be extended so that people or

00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,310
that the community is working on pi PI

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,520
and no chairs and these kind of words

00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,960
can use a normal tools to develop apps

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,190
it brings it very easily to the snappy

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,510
ecosystem

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,700
another important point for the common

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,769
ones is to strengthen be hard for

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,980
support that can be contributed by the

00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:31,409
community so we have at the moment the

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,320
ability for everyone to do a kernel snap

00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,850
and to makes it available somewhere but

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,559
it wouldn't it be good if we had like a

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,690
central database it would allow

00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,549
everybody to publish out there they

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,200
enablement so that people can start

00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,929
hacking or whatever platform they find

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,850
right away we will look at that and see

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:51,389
how we can makes it very easy for people

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,250
to come access and that's what not least

00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:56,100
obviously the store the store is the

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,320
central point for I'm everything around

00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,149
distribution integration and managing of

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,480
snap pea pods you know I set the

00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:05,070
ecosystem the moment you you feel like

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,470
it's more like just the place where you

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,730
put apps but in the future we want to

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,490
make this something far more powerful

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,379
where you use this as you have to really

00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:16,349
distribute your software you you can

00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:18,540
control how to drive cannery updates you

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,750
can potentially hook in your continuous

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,240
integration infrastructure so you can

00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,500
see earlier if problems are somewhere

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,510
down the road and one of the other

00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,030
snappy parts you are interested in and

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,919
we also want to ensure that the store

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,080
provides the api's that are needed for

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,109
management software to plug in and

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,109
control systems around the world all

00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,990
right so i hope i managed to get some

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:44,909
excitement over to you and we would have

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,830
if you have a few sessions are on on the

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,200
on the court wreck and all sorts of the

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,760
car tracker on slappy this week I'm if

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,540
you want you to talk about something

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,580
that isn't on there and want to have a

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,160
secession schedule feel free to talk to

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,660
me in person or one of the core directly

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,050
to and we try to make that happen for

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,240
you also if you want to engage with us

00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,310
check out the head snappy channel on

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,010
freenode or subscribe to one of our

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,630
mailing lists and obviously maybe check

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:18,330
out the docs on developable to

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:21,250
concessionary alright think that's it my

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:26,710
hand over to

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:31,090
however I think I already well thank you

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:33,100
it's like um that was quite a lot of

00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,930
information lots of news about snappy

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,470
and you know it's exciting times to be

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,710
around in in a bun to seeing you know

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,640
how decisions we made years ago

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,500
controversial or not you know are

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,300
actually not coming together to you know

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:51,700
enable us to do what we're currently

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:54,760
presenting so this cycle I'm leading the

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,730
blind effort so that includes the best

00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,290
of phone tablet conversions in you know

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,850
as the large bucket list large umbrella

00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:06,970
and so we just came back from a week in

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:10,270
Malta we were set back and then plant

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,470
you know how we can apply it snappy how

00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:17,560
we can incorporate snappy as a

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:21,580
technology and so all right there's some

00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:25,060
echo on the line and so I was a good

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,850
time right there because snappy enable

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:31,240
us to spread Ubuntu how to weigh more

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,070
devices and so before I dive into what

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,140
this means for the client side of the

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,500
banter I just wanted to reflect real

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,090
quick one on one thing there's lots of

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,550
innovation going on in a banty right now

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,320
with innovation comes change and change

00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:49,420
sometimes is you know hard to digest

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,920
there's concerns rumors and people just

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,750
feel strange about him so I just wanted

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:58,390
to highlight one important aspect if I

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,930
manage to screen share which should be

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:03,280
on now and so that is you know if you

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,650
look at the press and this is you know

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,290
my my weak attempt of a tag cloud you

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:10,270
see all those topics that you know my

00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,670
race desktop next we'll just blocked

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,290
about it last week bun to touch has been

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,000
out you know and we've been working that

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,490
that's the phone code base there's

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,200
questions around what what 1604 will be

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,660
like you know what does snappy really

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,540
mean to you man 2 and so on so forth you

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,040
know lots of curiosity and the the one

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,850
point I really would like to stress is

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,890
that regardless of what what we do with

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,960
those technologies you know the

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,830
underlying source of how goodness is

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,010
ubuntu and that is you know the sum of

00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:44,590
the archive Debian packages stabbed in

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,590
itself you know the cadence that one who

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,360
provides the levels of quality and most

00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,430
importantly the community that has been

00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,340
stressed so far already by Rick in a sec

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:57,400
and hours in the kickoff of the online

00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:59,830
summit and so I think we just have to

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,510
remember that that you know it's the sum

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,640
of everything that we do collaborate

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,840
literally that that makes advantage so

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,310
it's such a strong compelling

00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,340
distribution and offering and then

00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:14,770
everything that we do so snappy and and

00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,840
touch is build on top of that strong

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,340
foundation so I think that's that's just

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,010
a key message that was you know really

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:27,130
important for me to get out to take some

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:31,930
of the tension out and and mmm hi excuse

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,490
me um give you some perspective and I

00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:38,320
think mark you know like the I'm

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:40,540
personally involved with unity ate some

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,240
of you might know and so mark put it up

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,920
nicely yesterday in one of the questions

00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,350
whether unity aid will be the default

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,330
desktop in 1604 or not and is that you

00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,520
know let's let the community decide and

00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:57,090
i think that's that's strong proof of

00:38:51,520 --> 00:39:02,640
what i was trying to outline again so

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:05,740
for 1510 on the client side of things

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,720
convergence has been and will be still

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,840
like a big topic and what does it really

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,940
mean today we have the Ubuntu desktop

00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,590
you know the distribution as you know it

00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,030
as I'm running it on my laptops and

00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,500
computers it's running it on your

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,850
servers and then we have desktop next

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,230
something that as I said earlier bill

00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,670
was blogging about which was our

00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:29,400
playground to put the technologies that

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,700
we have developed for the phone onto

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,440
desktop computers laptops see how how

00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,050
the technologies pan out how it will

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,220
scale and how the architecture really

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:45,790
you know holds up and so I think we've

00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:48,250
been quite successful in doing that

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,840
we are well aware of all the the gaps

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,840
that we have regarding the user

00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,890
experience and so we have a team working

00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:00,010
on that too close those user experience

00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:03,910
gaps you know taking the the shell from

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:05,830
a phone 22 to tablet or laptop it's

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,590
quite you know different use cases so

00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:11,590
you know I hope we'll see improvements

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,110
in supporting legacy apps you know BMW

00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,960
see we demo'd liberal office running on

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,440
arm on the touch code base and doing

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,270
some conversions by you know entering

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,250
switching nodes between the tablet mode

00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,330
and a desktop windowed mode so i think

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:30,070
you know we'll see you a more

00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:35,080
improvements and progress there then we

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:37,480
will add one additional image that will

00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,820
incorporate so that will be the next

00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,130
evolution where we will incorporate

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,560
snappy as a technology so we will take

00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,910
the whole unit e ates stack if you will

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,120
so unity eight year and all the

00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:52,090
underlying components and you know marry

00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,590
them together with snappy that will then

00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,210
be the base platform for all the

00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,070
commercial products that canonical is

00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,410
doing so that we inherit all the

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,710
goodness that ashs presented that snappy

00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:06,130
is providing again this is on top of you

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,710
know the Ubuntu distribution so any any

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,680
press reports of my death threat of

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:16,020
ubuntu switching to snap format you know

00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:18,430
not quite true and then general

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,780
improvements on the shell there's you

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,410
know a couple of the work items we have

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,060
to do for phones mark already stole my

00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,790
thunder yesterday about the pocket

00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,950
desktop so you have the phone you have

00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,110
unity eight there and then the ability

00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,060
to take the mwc demo that i was just

00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:36,820
talking about you know into production

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,490
and have it as a product out that users

00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,830
can actually use am so taking it from a

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,390
demo continue a product i think that's

00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:47,560
that's one of the big focuses for this

00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:51,340
second um if tons of sessions planned in

00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,560
the convergence track in this online

00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,840
summit i would like to invite you to

00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,400
join all those sessions and participate

00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,920
share your ideas you know bring up

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,119
different views of how we could improve

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,240
Ubuntu how we could improve unity aid

00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,590
the whole client side of things and you

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,420
know just work with us and give us

00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,270
feedback the team and I will be there

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,890
you know you go to your feedback and

00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:17,170
then I think the culmination of that is

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:22,240
a Q&A session on the first day I think

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:23,770
it's at 1,400 UTC you know where we will

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,900
be answering all your questions

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:30,160
regarding client so I'm looking forward

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:33,670
to seeing you there all right that's the

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,430
end of the client updates rip your

00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:43,180
Robbie who wants to take over I'll take

00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:46,090
over um yeah so hi I'm Robbie Williamson

00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,740
I may have you may or may not know me

00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,770
I've been around for a while pretty much

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:54,850
as long as Rick mostly on the server and

00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,860
cloud side recently and I have the

00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,980
privilege of being the vice president of

00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,840
cloud and developer of our cloud

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,810
development operations within canonical

00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,730
what does that mean it's basically um

00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,080
focus actually I will be on cloud and

00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:14,830
cloud is important to us don't get me

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:16,390
wrong but um it's also more about see I

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,790
guess scale-out workloads if you think

00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,230
about it and you know what our scale at

00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:23,830
work loads during all these complex

00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:27,760
deployments of applications if you could

00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:30,280
be either you know containers VMs and

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,570
even bare metal and that's really the

00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,119
focus of what we've done with the

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,859
country server over the last few years

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,210
cloud is absolutely important but it's

00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:38,440
more than just that it's the workloads

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,359
that are running in these clouds that

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,010
are actually moving from you know public

00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:44,770
clouds of private clouds to to bare

00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:49,030
metal to two containers and VMS on these

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:50,770
machines um I was a talking about we

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,600
started about how you know like five

00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,760
years ago we were like wrapping up you

00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,300
know 1004 LTS which just went into life

00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,160
and uh you know I think for those of us

00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,900
for you who are with us at UDS we had

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,550
them you know in person we were in

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,440
Brussels or actually the hope I think

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,000
which was like outside of Brussels it

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,070
was a great venue but I think by the end

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,590
of the week the trees turned the bars we

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,549
were ready to go home and we were headed

00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,920
into

00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:18,459
the tintin release and Mark had made a a

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,130
very strong and impressed effort to get

00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:23,920
me to get us to release it on a Tin Tin

00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:26,859
Tin the first and probably last for at

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,890
least we ever do on a Sunday um so good

00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:31,539
times and at that time it was

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,640
interesting cuz we released a video that

00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:35,410
I had kind of put together and you know

00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,420
had had that the the Twisted Sister

00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:41,529
we're not gonna take it music and kind

00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,880
of attacked microsoft and windows as at

00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:46,209
the time that was what we were trying to

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,589
do with it with the desktop and looking

00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:49,420
back at it now where we've come you know

00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,769
today where microsoft is honestly one of

00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,150
our best partners in the server space

00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:53,499
like i'll go into that little bit but

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,640
it's it's funny how things can really

00:44:53,499 --> 00:45:02,709
change in terms of ubuntu and kind of

00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:05,109
focus so I guess this cycle this the

00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:06,939
track if you notice it's it's mostly

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,339
focused around kind of some key areas

00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:12,279
some key technologies that mark kind of

00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:14,229
highlighted in his keynote and then some

00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:15,910
additional ones that that weren't really

00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:18,479
highlight as much as I wanted to cover

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,670
really quickly number one being

00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:22,989
OpenStack you know from the beginning of

00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,609
when she's been very very tightly

00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:26,890
integrated and synced with OpenStack I'm

00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:28,509
very proud of that some some of the

00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,400
founding members of opus that came from

00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,929
did when she community and are still

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,229
involved in that and I take a lot of

00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:37,179
pride of that the the dell developed the

00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:38,859
dev and release process for OpenStack

00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:40,749
you know if you're familiar with it six

00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:42,910
months cadence they gave me together in

00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:44,709
a son at the beginning they iteratively

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,769
released throughout the throughout the

00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:50,019
cycle and it's it's honestly you

00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:51,309
borrowed and modified from from what

00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:53,589
they've learned from Glen to which which

00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:58,239
has worked so well these last ten years

00:45:53,589 --> 00:46:01,809
or so 1504 which just released has the

00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,309
latest kila release of OpenStack were

00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,900
able to do that because of our tightly

00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:06,939
integrated release process and able to

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,380
actually even you know OpenStack can

00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:10,890
release after kilo we can get those

00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:14,829
updates right into the release of 1504

00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:16,689
and then obviously our LTS support a lot

00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:18,699
of folks who run clouds want the

00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:20,319
long-term support they they needed just

00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:22,749
the need to stay on their West longer

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,819
than then the the short cycle of a non

00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:27,739
LTS five years it's much more desirable

00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:29,839
so we do a lot of work and maintaining

00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:33,589
the blue to cloud archive we be in

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,089
canonical such that you know you can use

00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:38,089
the latest and greatest OpenStack on a

00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:40,099
trusted release of your OS so you don't

00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:42,019
have multiple moving parts there that's

00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,940
I think a contribution I'm very very

00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:48,769
proud of you know that we've done for

00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,630
OpenStack and you know we I think folks

00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:52,369
kind of forget about launchpad you know

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,130
if you work in canonical you don't but

00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:56,809
outside of it obviously it the use of it

00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,489
is it's obviously more focused on a bun

00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:00,319
too but a launch pad is still a

00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:02,599
leveraged resource for OpenStack

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,729
development um pretty excited that they

00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,890
that they were able to get get support

00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:08,269
into that that's like a unicorn for us

00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,319
you've been economical for a while and

00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:12,259
trying to get in that feature and

00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,789
support an attempt to launch pad and

00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:15,559
then finally some of the work that's

00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:19,699
done around the OpenStack integration

00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:21,529
lab a lot of software and hardware

00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:23,869
vendors come to you know canonical to

00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:26,390
get to ensure that to help us help them

00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:28,729
test their their their product and that

00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,019
does it work with OpenStack now and as

00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,459
it you know iterates through a

00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,109
development process and we try to feed

00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:35,809
them back just reports and information

00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,369
so that they know when the new OpenStack

00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:40,249
releases any problems that they're going

00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:43,459
to face in terms of their in terms of

00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:44,900
their product and the feedback that we

00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:46,400
get from them is how valuable that is

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,989
because all the different moving parts

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,199
of OpenStack all the different projects

00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:52,969
the core projects that the satellite

00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,479
projects and so forth and having all

00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:59,239
those moving parts tested routinely

00:47:55,479 --> 00:48:03,979
daily is a value that they get and that

00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:06,680
we have to provide the tracks this cycle

00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:10,029
there's I think upcoming sessions around

00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:14,150
what's new in terms of kilo 1504

00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:15,680
specific tracks around technologies of

00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:17,599
OpenStack but that are not obviously

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,279
part of course at flex such as my sequel

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,049
which we were no near and dear to our

00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:23,239
hearts we've been around for a while I'm

00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:24,650
some of the improvements are on that but

00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,140
if you look to the track I think it will

00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:30,170
see as a predominance around charms and

00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,359
juju which is a you know a pretty key

00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,729
project for us within the blink to

00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:37,369
server community and canonical as as we

00:48:34,729 --> 00:48:39,589
focus on scale out workloads juju is

00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,420
critical you know nuts to the cloud

00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:42,799
but you know two of rare metal

00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,229
deployments to pretty much everything we

00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:47,289
do because it's focused on orchestrating

00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:49,549
these things these complex workloads and

00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:53,799
creating it making it easier for the

00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:56,450
user to do so um juju rely it runs a

00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:58,099
cross a I said public lounge private

00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:59,900
clouds be an OpenStack and bare metal

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:01,339
the bare metal obviously was driven

00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,559
through what we call metal as a service

00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:07,339
which is mass will try to take your

00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:09,589
hardware and pull it together as a as

00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,969
the cloud would right so you you know so

00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:12,619
you're actually be able to get the power

00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:15,349
of the cloud but on the speed and the

00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:17,180
performance of bare metal I'm pretty

00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:19,880
pretty happy with the maturation of mass

00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,979
over the years it started out as just a

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,210
I you know a hacky project in a room

00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:24,739
where a bunch of server engineers are

00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,210
like we need something to to control

00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:28,249
these machines and now it's evolved to

00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:31,069
you know supporting tons of hardware

00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:34,039
multiple s is not just a bun to not just

00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:36,519
Linux it's being leveraged by

00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,509
institutions across no banking

00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,519
telecommunications cloud hosting it's

00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:42,019
it's it's pretty amazing to see what

00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,999
that team is done and that project has

00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:46,519
done and if you if you if you need a

00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:49,880
tool to manage your your your hardware

00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:51,319
and to to install in any OS it doesn't

00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,719
it's not does not to be a bunch of we

00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:55,910
have people using it to install su so

00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:57,380
you can install windows i highly

00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,119
encourage you to take a look at it um

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,339
it's a project that i'm pretty proud of

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,069
and that that's pretty awesome to see

00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:06,559
how far it's come in terms of being them

00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:07,640
to manage hardware and and the way dude

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,380
you integrates with that being up to

00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,969
deploy not just clouds you know tell us

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,769
cloud is just a scale-out workload but

00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:16,130
you can you can deploy any workload on

00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:17,809
these machines be it no hadoop or set

00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,359
for swift in terms of you know file

00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:23,109
system storage so those two join

00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:25,069
together a pretty awesome combination

00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:28,759
that kind of doesn't it you know

00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:30,079
ducktales into juju and and i've been

00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,789
involved with that since you know very

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,009
beginning um when we were internally

00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:35,479
calling an ensemble and then you know we

00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:37,369
had its coming out party with juju and

00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:40,700
charms and it's been pretty amazing ride

00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:42,289
ever since and the restoration of not

00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,559
just due to itself but the community

00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,509
around it in the focus around charms if

00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,969
you've seen juju charms calm and in the

00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:51,529
evolution of that it's freaking amazing

00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:53,150
the GUI itself and what you can do with

00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:55,789
that that website and how easy

00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,559
makes it to deploy manager clothes it's

00:50:55,789 --> 00:51:00,200
awesome i highly encourage you to check

00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,480
that out you know now we have support

00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,700
again for all the public clouds the

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,520
major ones some smaller ones OpenStack

00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:10,279
bare metal and mass you know you can

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,500
basically run your the freedom of

00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:14,299
flexibility if you have a bunch you to

00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,940
run anywhere you want anytime you want

00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:19,010
anyway you that's amazing to me we

00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,359
focused a lot on the growth of the

00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,859
community around the workloads

00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:23,960
themselves around the charms we love

00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:26,329
contribution to do Jude you know we

00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,430
welcome the help in terms of developing

00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:30,049
this project but you know if I if I were

00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:33,619
asked where do I really want you know

00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:35,059
the the community growth and the forces

00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:38,359
behind the challenge behind these

00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:39,980
workloads I'm having the up streams for

00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,470
these workloads take ownership of them

00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:44,029
and use them as a way to promote their

00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,920
that you know their applications because

00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:48,109
it's it is easier to install that way

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,339
and you you have the benefit of being

00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:51,920
able you know once you watch this

00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:54,500
charmed it runs anywhere so maybe you

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,569
want to run on AWS for a while then you

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,279
know the the cloud public cloud prices

00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:59,510
change and you decide to switch over to

00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:02,809
google compute you could do it that

00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,490
easily with juju you know or maybe you

00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:05,930
know your lab all of a sudden has a

00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,849
boost of hardware you want to bring that

00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,920
stuff in house again to do that without

00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:12,549
much change to how you deploy how you

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,930
manage because it's already charmed and

00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:16,609
that charm is is backed by the

00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,349
excellence of the upstream knows how to

00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:21,710
run that given application and upstream

00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:25,579
could be commercial or or open-source in

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:27,410
terms of just a project we have a lot of

00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,880
contributions from from around the from

00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,849
from around the entire ecosystem on that

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,140
it's pretty excited to see that grow a

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:34,490
mindful the time here i have about three

00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:38,859
minutes left so I mean what else we

00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:42,829
could covering into this cycle um Lex d

00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:44,779
which is our focus on a container

00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:46,569
hypervisor some of you may have seen the

00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:50,059
announcements you know over the year

00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:53,000
seen various demos a ty Cole Anderson

00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:55,309
gave us a pretty sweet demo around do

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,740
min in the migration of live workloads

00:52:55,309 --> 00:53:00,470
within a Lex debased OpenStack

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,450
deployment Lexie you know runs beyond

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,920
just OpenStack it is a way that we can

00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,180
run OpenStack you know depended upon

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,490
which you want to do with that workload

00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,010
obviously if you want

00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:10,240
windows clients in your overstock you're

00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:12,790
going to be more constrained to a vm

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,260
approach but but if if your workloads

00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,250
your linux pace lexi is probably a

00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,140
better way to go in terms of getting

00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,090
more bang for your buck terms of the

00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:21,580
hardware performance um there's a

00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:24,340
show-and-tell I believe we're Tycho will

00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,440
demo and show lxd in action I have no

00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,960
idea what that demo is so I'll probably

00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,820
tune in myself just check it out and

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,500
then there's a lot of talk around snappy

00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,300
I'm not gonna go too far I do because I

00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,220
think I'll antenna did a great job but

00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:40,000
it's also something that we've we've

00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:42,100
seen as a plus going into the cloud you

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,930
know transactional updates are very

00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,390
useful in a cloud in terms of you know

00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:48,160
being able to just kill a vm or roll it

00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,030
back and have the same exact deployment

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,000
because you already have that

00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:55,810
encapsulated a deployment in a container

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in a snap Netflix is somebody who does

00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,470
this a lot right i mean they they they

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,210
get happy with the exact configuration

00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,040
they want and they just redeploy

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,720
redeploy redeploy there's no you know

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,190
apt get updates orientales going on it

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,260
and in those environments and that's

00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,700
something that we've heard from the user

00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,650
is not in the cloud community of death

00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,050
but that's what they want so snappy

00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:17,950
really fit well and into that into that

00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:21,280
model and you know right now you know

00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:22,960
snappy is it's it's it's not where we

00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,130
ultimately like would like it to be for

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,869
the cloud i mean obviously you can see

00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,310
the the convergence of juju it's not be

00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:31,359
coming along where do you juice

00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:32,710
deploying snaps in a sense of being able

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:36,310
to have those transactional updates that

00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:37,780
you can drive you know it's a natural

00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,400
evolution and obviously it's not

00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,890
surprised at that that will happen um

00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,390
and you know we welcome your feedback in

00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:47,710
your comments on how that should should

00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:49,540
that occur down down the line and then I

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,890
guess finally you know we wrap up with a

00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,950
minute left is around the community

00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,240
around server and cloud I think you know

00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,650
for a while there's always jokes that

00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,109
the community of you know server was

00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,550
pretty small and and you know as the

00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:02,050
cloud evolved it's like well you know

00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:05,080
who is our community but the communities

00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:07,630
actually kind of evolved and grown to be

00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:10,090
you know users and contributors around

00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:11,740
cloud and scale out workloads and the

00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,420
community is not just your individuals

00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,619
but you know huge what we call

00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,390
corporations that are contributing

00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:17,980
directly into a plenty that are that are

00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,110
improving adventure for the user you

00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:22,780
know IBM's which telecom cloud base

00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:25,540
docker and of course all the millions of

00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:27,610
users on the cloud so I think you know

00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,900
i'm pretty pretty exciting to see where

00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:31,150
bunches server and if you cloud have

00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,760
come from a community standpoint the

00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,100
community it's fast you'd grown um and

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,540
again you know if if you if you

00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,690
interested in contributing to any of

00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:42,810
these topics please join the sessions

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:46,450
you can find me on IRC robbie w there

00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:48,010
and yeah just looking forward to this

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,930
cycle it's going to be pretty crazy

00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,430
obviously wildly werewolf can't wait to

00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:55,030
see what the what the shirt you're gonna

00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,200
look like oh and that's it i'm wife all

00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,610
the time and we got to start in about

00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,050
five minutes i'll hand it over to

00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:02,050
michael's you need to close the comments

00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,880
he asked all right well i hope that give

00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:06,640
everybody a taste of what's going to be

00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,140
happening this week so now go out find

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,820
out where you want to be involved in a

00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,400
bun tube and sign up for those sessions

00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,230
and participate in them i hope you all

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,750
have a good week and we'll see you all
