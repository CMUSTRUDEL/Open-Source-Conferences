uh yes by reece davis i am a developer

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,600
advocate for

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
canonical for ubuntu uh and i cover

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,519
numerous numerous different things but

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
at the moment uh being on the community

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
team i'm

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,840
helping bootstrap some community things

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
and helps with some wider larger

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
community goals

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,920
for various canonical adventure products

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,240
yup and so we are part of the

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,360
newly rebooted community team

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,320
so and um having

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
these kind of really cool community init

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
initiatives

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
is part of kind of what we really wanted

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,479
to

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,280
to undo and so i think this first one is

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
kind of we have um it's interesting

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
because this

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,320
is being simulcast on youtube and twitch

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
and i don't know if you all know but a

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
thing happened in irc world

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,920
this week it's still we're still uh we

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,040
have moved over from frino to

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
libera but it did slow things down a bit

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
we were hoping to have

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
a bot that would be able to bridge the

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
ubuntu on

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,920
air people in in irc

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,400
so a shout out to all of you there

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,760
so we wanted to be able to bridge you to

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
the twitch chat

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,120
and then we could bridge twitch chat and

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,920
youtube so we could have everybody

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,360
together talking in the same place

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,280
but then this week happened so we hope

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,560
maybe by the next time

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,760
we have this going and oh speaking of

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840

with ubuntu and the raspberry pi in the

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
past what we

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
what we're doing right now what we're

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
working on and sort of our thoughts and

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
plans

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
for the future so that'll be exciting

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,799
i'm gonna we're gonna promote that one a

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
little bit more than this

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,840
because this is a bit of a warm-up um

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
well

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,360
maybe we'll tell you about the uh the

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,200
technical issues we were having before

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
the stream

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,879
when we were trying to test things in

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,159
production but we could look at this

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,319
one later you have

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,519
no idea but you touched on you touched

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,799
on the free node thing

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
all of the drama that's going on this

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,640
week and you've been uh from our side

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
from the community

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
uh team side of the inside canonical

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,680
you've been sort of leading that charge

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
and handling everything so i wondered

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
could you

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
add springing this on you so you don't

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
have to but uh could you

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,799
tell a bit of the story see what's been

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
going on update the people if they

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,000
haven't heard

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,160
yes so if you haven't been on twitter

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
and kind of the geekier portions of the

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,080
internet

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,800
this week like i'm sure my family has no

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
idea

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
about this and i'm kind of jealous of

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
their

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,160
ignorance is bliss but free node where

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
we have been on since god the start of

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,080
the

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,240
ubuntu project um

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,960
has been under it was sold

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,000
recently to someone named andrew lee

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,919
who and this led to

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,840
the resignation of staffers which when

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
that first happened it was like oh this

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
was a

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,400
leak but this is something we've had

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
ready just in case

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
and then things accelerated to the point

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
that last week

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,600
that nearly all of free node's volunteer

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,560
staff

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
resigned and so we kind of were like

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,320
well we might need to start thinking of

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:22,320
finding a new home for irc and i know

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:26,160
that especially for any of kind of

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
our younger listeners maybe or people

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
who

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
are here through discord or use other

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
things you might be like

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
well irc still exists isn't that like

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
super

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
old and yes it is super old and yes

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,960
projects still

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,800
use it and there's a lot of like our

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,160
meetings and infrastructure that

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,720
absolutely depend on irc

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
and so when things started going

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
squirrely last week

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
we were um we were literally at the

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,039
point of like okay we

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,600
might need to talk to the irc council

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,560
and come up with the backup plan and

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
then

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
last god i think it was tuesday night i

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
was just about to go

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,600
to bed and i see a thing

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,720
from jose that our channel

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,360
had because we had been pointing people

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,440
we had been doing doing a slow move over

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,479
to

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,120
libera the irc council who is

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,639
our community governance set handles all

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,639
things irc

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,120
they made a proposal to the community

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,000
council who is our general ubuntu

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,840
governance and they are voted in by the

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,479
ubuntu members

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,759
and they so they gave this basically

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,360
a soft quorum saying that

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
okay get in touch with all the other

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,400
stakeholders like all of our flavors

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
but otherwise let's get this move going

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,639
so we were in the process

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
and then tuesday our channels which were

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
pointing to

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,280
pointing to libera got

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,199
basically um were

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
subject to a hostile takeover which

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,960
happened to about 700 projects

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,400
yes that night uh including things like

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
fosdem

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,919
um and a lot of other projects

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,240
like the fedora project i think gentoo

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
basically most open source projects that

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
were on

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,280
frino that had pointed to

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,479
libera basically they came in deopt

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
everybody

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,160
uh changed the topic pointed it to a

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
double

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,120
hashtag and then left so we were just

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
like okay we've got to make

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
it's kind of like you know that point in

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
when you're moving

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
and you hit that last day and you still

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
have a house full of stuff and you're

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
like

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
forget it we're just gonna make all the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
miscellaneous boxes

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
and throw our stuff into big giant

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
garbage bags

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,520
that's what happened that's kind of what

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,400
happened

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,680
and so yesterday was moving our uh

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
moving our bots

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
over because a lot of our meetings if

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
you've ever gone to

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,599
any of the community council meetings

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,080
the membership meetings the tech boards

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,800
they all

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
happen on irc we have to get our bots

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
moved over and set

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,919
up get all the channels done and then

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
once we did that

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,280
we repointed our dns last night so

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
we're still unpacking you know we're

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,360
getting used to

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
our new home and so we're getting we're

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,159
still getting like things like

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,640
channel per missions and all of those

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
things

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,279
set and things like cloaks i've learned

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
more about cloaks and bots this last

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
week

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,440
i think i said on twitter i only want to

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
deal with cloaks and bots in the context

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
of star wars

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,440
from now on just it was

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,839
it was painful but i am so

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
proud especially of the community

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,000
council and the irc council because

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,040
they were on top of this

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,040
and as soon as things started to go

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
where we realized they were going

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
pear-shaped

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
the irc council had a proposal to the

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,720
community council

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
the community council moved on it that

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
night

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,040
and especially since our community

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
council

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,839
is they've been in office since november

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,080
of last year and um for those of you who

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
haven't been in the community we hadn't

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,240
had one

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,040
that was act um that was active for

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,080
a few years and so i feel so proud of

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,720
our community governance for just

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
stepping up and rising to the occasion

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
during

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,360
what was a really stressful time and

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,839
like i said on one of my tweets i

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,920
couldn't imagine doing this without a

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,800
community council it would have been a

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,240
nightmare

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
an absolute nightmare and so this is why

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
yay

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,160
our community is great and i know that

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
um

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
actually you all um the community

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
council got a nice little

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,760
shout out on vice news of all things

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,760
because i guess andrew lee was like oh

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
well i wish the people who moved would

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
have

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,760
put it to a vote and and then they said

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
oh

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,200
well groups like ubuntu and

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
entos put it to their community

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,120
governance and they voted to move

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,640
so haha so community that's great

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360

meyer in the meeting where we were

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
talking about kind of what would need to

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
be

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,600
what would need to be done and so

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
and also seth arnold on the

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
side who's also been really active in

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
our irc com

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,560
community and also he is one of our

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,440
incoming members of the new irc council

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
so so he's got a nice new furniture to

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,680
move into

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,079
it but it but also

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,040
it's really great to see more canonical

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,480
people

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,680
who are ubuntu members um

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,800
kind of uh standing for

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,959
four community councils and so it's just

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
it's really good to see that's something

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,519
i think that we had

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,560
more of in the past and so

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,880
yeah and yeah so um

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
and so if you are ubuntu members and you

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,320
had your lovely ubuntu cloak

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:06,079
i i still don't know what irc cooks do

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,399
but we are in the process of kind of

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
getting everyone their cloaks back it

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
just

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
you know it just seems like something

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,000
like you wear to a

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,959
renaissance fair but yeah

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,279
so don't worry uh luna we will get you

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
your

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,279
sh you and all the members we will get

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,560
your we will get you your

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,600
shiny ubuntu member cloaks and you can

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
do

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
whatever it is you can do on irc with

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
those clips

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
whatever you need a clerk for it sounds

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
cool it does sound like

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
it does sort of it i think it dates irc

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,240
a little bit but it sounds cool

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,880
in a sort of sort of retro kind of way i

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
like it

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,079
it does like a cloak that sounds cool

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,639
yep so

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,839
that's that's definitely been a thing

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,440
we've been doing with the

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,519
community that is weak is you know

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
the equivalent of like getting your

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,639
friends together and bribing them with

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,639
pizza and being hey

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,800
i need to be out out of here so

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,079
okay so our podcast who is if you all

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,800
if you all are in our twitch channel uh

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,600
you should and if you are into data

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
science

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,079
and or racing games you should

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,040
definitely give uh

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,839
our podcast a follow he actually just

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,880
did a stream with our old friend martin

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,480
impressed yesterday

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,399
at his shiny new job yes so they were

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
talking about using slim docker

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,440
containers with r

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,720
um but he has a really great podcast and

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,440
he's done some cool data science with

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
the racing game that we all played which

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,040
was just cool

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,519
oh yeah we have like the most

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,079
ridiculously over

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
engineered tricked out stuff for that

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,680
game

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,399
it's awesome and

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,959
oh and someone just explained it that a

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
cloak is just to affirm your association

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
it's like a badge of honor that's very

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
cool cool

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,360
a cloak of honor that's that sounds i

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
like that

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
oh especially if we had like some kind

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,240
of cool like

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:19,920
you know like those cloak pins like yeah

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,639
yeah we can make it in the ubuntu

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,920
shape oh that would be cool but does

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,760
that mean you have to have like the

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,040
big bright ubuntu orange cloak with a

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
little pin because that would be

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
very loud people would know who you

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,600
would well

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,519
there is um i've heard stories that

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,440
somebody was trying to

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,920
have an ubuntu tartan so oh

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,600
oh yeah i saw that as well because

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,959
there's a debbie in tartan

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,880
so well then we must have one is that

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
how it works downstream we'll get some

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,360
we'll get some debian targeted make some

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,839
more boutique time

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,839
cool that would be fantastic

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,320
that'd be cool actually if there's any

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,519
scottish people listening that's

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,560
that's should be a goal yeah and i

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,760
and i think what's nice because i think

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,600
i was looking because

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,760
do you know how many yards of fabric it

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,440
takes to make one of those

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,600
no a lot and

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
getting this woven would be yeah we

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,240
definitely need some

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
weavers and things but what was i going

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
to say

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,320
but like if you wanted to make like the

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,079
like the stole

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,880
or the wrap that women wear over their

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
shoulder that's like not as much fabric

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
so

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
yeah you have so much more celtic

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,839
knowledge than me

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
than yet i went to a lot of renaissance

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
festivals back in the day

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,000
so

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
yeah but you but you guys have roman

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,079
festivals though which

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,600
are awesome yeah and i

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
haven't been to one of those but i

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,519
always wanted to

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
just once all the craziness stops you'll

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
be able to come and we'll all we'll all

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,839
go for an ubuntu

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,839
roman festival

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,440
distinctly not the ubuntu cult rolly the

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,199
beetle distinctly not the beauty cult

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
we will try to stay away from that kind

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
of mentality

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,959
although if hey if you want to start

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,519
that project as a community project you

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
will we'll support you as long as you

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
keep it

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,440
within the law it's all good just don't

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,839
go to the scientology route and like

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,320
build

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,759
people and or imprison them on boats so

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,279
yes okay

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
imagine if we did the ability releases

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,759
in roman numerals that would be great

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,839
oh my gosh that's hilarious so

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
reese i am going to leave you to manage

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,680
the stream because somebody just rang at

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,720
our door and i think my husband's in

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,160
a meeting so yeah go ahead you go answer

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
your door

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
i'll ask you i'll keep talking for a

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,720
little bit okay

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,799
you uh yeah i'll be right back it's

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,199
gonna be right back

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,959
so i'll speak a little bit about uh what

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,400
was happening beforehand then so before

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,799
the stream moniker and i

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
both joined uh stream yard it's a sort

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,000
of it's a tool that we're using in the

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
beginning to sort of get used to

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
streaming on two sites and correlate

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
coalesce the the two

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
all the chats into one place and both of

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,799
us were having audio issues i couldn't

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,880
hear monica on

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,160
google hangouts but she couldn't hear me

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,039
on stream yard and so we've got them

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
with open now

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
and it's just a nightmare so maybe we'll

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,000
uh maybe we'll look to

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,919
up our game i hear people are

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,039
maintaining obs studio pretty well maybe

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,400
we'll see if we can get that to work

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
next time instead

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080
streaming art is awesome we're we're

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,559
definitely enjoying it but it's uh

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,919
for some reason just audio issues maybe

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,039
it's just first timers

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,559
first time has problems right that's

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,679
what our podcast said it's like a rite

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,120
of passage

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,919
even though this isn't a podcast it's

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,120
still still audio issues

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,320
uh yeah i hope uh so this is ubuntu on

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,520
app this is a

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,200
project that we wanted to restart so

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,720
uh for anyone who doesn't know i think

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
we did a little bit of context over on a

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
couple of

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
blog posts but just i'll reiterate

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,440
anyway this channel

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,400
uh this youtube channel existed a long

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,240
time ago

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
anyway well not a long time ago a few

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
years ago where there was

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
uh documentation days and testing days

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
and people from the community team at

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,919
canonical would get

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
on stream and they talk about the things

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,240
that they're doing or they do some

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
some sort of live work right and so that

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,520
was one of the things that

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,720
where monica did a nice retrospective of

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
what happened to the community and the

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
decline of the ubuntu community

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
that we found that people really liked

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
people enjoyed and was something that we

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,799
were both very keen

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,160
uh to get to bring back for things like

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,120
this for office hours

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
but i think more um more importantly for

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,400
down the road

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,400
we brought this back for community

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
people to eventually start doing

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
streaming

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,240
streams on this themselves right so if

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
if

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,840
someone were to create the ubuntu cult

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
officially but not do any cult

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,080
things but do interesting nice fun

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,000
things it would be awesome

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,200
if in a couple of oh when it comes back

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
if in a couple of months

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,360
um you had something to talk about and

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
we could hand you the keys to the

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
channel and you could come on and talk

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
about your

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,039
your event what you're doing and it

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
would be talk about the ubuntu cult a

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,240
little bit

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
yeah just as long as you're the super

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,480
happy fun cult so

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,480
yes the good cults not the bad cults

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,240
oh and actually eric that is

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,760
a question that do you mind if we save

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,360
that for the desktop

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,440
in daba tomorrow because reese and i

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,799
are we are great people people

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,000
um we are not

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,160
great at like tech question people

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
but yes but considering that there have

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,880
been some other questions like that

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,240
on ubuntu hideout which shout out to the

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
people from ubuntu

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,919
hideout which is a really awesome

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,799
discord server

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,520
um that they have been asking similar

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,360
questions

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,440
and so i know that that would be um

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
that that would be a great thing to ask

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
so yes so we

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
at some point we will have tech-minded

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,240
people

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,400
as special guests and so you guys can

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
kind of talk to them in a casual sort of

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,679
way

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,799
that doesn't overlap what the desktop

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
team is doing with their

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,840
in-davas um but yeah because reese and i

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,960
are gonna be like that's a great

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,480
question

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,919
we could we could try and answer the

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,200
question it just wouldn't be very good

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
or useful at all

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,720
yeah it would pretty much be a tech

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,080
questions wrong answers

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,960
only so exactly yeah yeah

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
and i also think that the telemetry data

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,799
is also

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,320
incredible i think i want to say it's

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,960
pretty anonymized already so

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
it's really just like the absolute bare

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,360
basics

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,640
so which is good because no we are not

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,520
making any money off the telemetry

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,440
data it's just to help us know what are

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,240
people using

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
to on so we kind of know how to build it

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
better

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,480
so yes and really

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,120
and i think that yannick has eric pretty

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,760
much paid

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
he just wants data to play with

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,440
everything

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,320
i mean when you're a data scientist

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,400
everything is a

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,679
data set let's be honest so

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,200
i'll just tell the truth i've just i've

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,480
just taken that question and now i'll

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
send it over to

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,600
to heather to put into her list of

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,240
questions that she's collecting already

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,240
so

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,919
hopefully that'll be that'll be answered

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
for you right away

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
come on yep and so yeah so you

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,080
definitely

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960
yes you do need to work ubuntu into the

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,000
names

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,480
somehow good point yes so

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,360
and there was a question that eric had

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
asked about

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,000
getting that sweet ubuntu swag which i

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,559
know

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
that is a question that we are very much

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,280
in the process of

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,600
working on and because part of it is

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,440
is that our swag is stuck in the blue

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,960
fin building

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,559
which has been stuck closed

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,480
she's been closed so there's there's a

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,880
couple of things to it right um

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,240
the i don't i mean i'm i'm almost

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
certain they wouldn't mind me saying so

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,960
i'll say it

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,480
the uh marketing team have been working

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,720
on getting this kind of swag stuff

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,520
going and rolling for a long time and

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
like you say

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,960
um a lot of it initially was just stuck

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
in the

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,559
bluefin office which is the which is

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,480
chronicles london office

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,600
where a bunch of people work on their

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
woodwork normally

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,520
if the world was normal um and so a lot

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,880
of it's stuck in there but

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,280
the plan is the plan was and is to

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
start thinking more about distribution

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
and getting

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,000
getting things like that to people and

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
with everything else that's going on

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,200
those kinds of supply chains that kind

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,640
of um distributors and

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
and vendors are having a lot of hard

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,679
times it's it's just difficult to

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
coordinate those kinds of things at the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,960
moment

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,480
but yeah but swag in general

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
we're we're looking in that direction

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,559
and we we like the sound of it

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
we tomorrow not tomorrow on tuesday when

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
i speak with dave

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,120
and william i'm i will hopefully

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
have the uh the go ahead to mention a

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
little bit of

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,080
a bit of swag spoilers then yeah

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
and especially seeing some of the

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,400

urbans are adorbs

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
and the artwork for ego and ehrman was

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,880
just really

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,960
pretty it was really nice so i'm still

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,480
team tell you different

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,760
the yes the owen the eo and ermin uh was

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,159
one of my favorites because that was the

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,000
first release of ubuntu that happened

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
after i joined canonicals that was fun

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,320
it was nice to see the uh

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,080
how the sausage got made and then my my

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,080
actual favorite though is the

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,200
is the groovy gorilla which because that

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,880
had the uh

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,080
it had a very heavy sort of raspberry

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
pie thing with it because it was the

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,799
first time we had a raspberry pi desktop

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
image

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
and it was when i was on the on the

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,080
product team and on

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,279
the product side of things i sort of led

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,720
the way so it was good to make the

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
sausage as well as see how the sausage

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
was made

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
contributing that way it was good fun

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,520

my hippo shirt is on the way

but they make the most awesome t-shirts

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
and you've probably seen some people

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,320
with their focal fossa shirt because it

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,840
kind of looks like

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:09,919
a like a like look like a biker gang

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:13,679
shirt oh well these are amazing

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,600
whoa yeah oh yeah we taught reese i

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
think awesome

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,919
how did i not know about that and also

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,919
your ipping won't be nearly as

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,159
expensive possibly

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
that's true that's true but then if when

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
i when i get prints from sylvia

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,960
those would be those would be nice and

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,480
expensive for me so

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,880
it evens out yeah but they have

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,679
and they have an eo and irman shirt too

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
that is like

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,279
super cute so i think i might just get

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,000
that it's like that was before i

00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,880
contributed but i was

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,799
using and i liked it so much that even

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,200
when it went end of life i didn't

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,440
upgrade so

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,399
wow we don't recommend you do that

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
we don't recommend you do that no no

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,880
though i think somebody was saying that

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,200
their parents are still on like

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,320
1204 so oh really

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,520
yeah yeah that's that's

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,039
um yeah we also don't recommend it

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,880
doing that especially if you're

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,000
providing tech support to

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,960
your family make things easy on you make

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
things easy

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,559
especially since that's gone that went

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,760
end of life that went end of extended

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,840
i don't think they even did extended

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,120
maintenance for 12. interesting yeah

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,720
that's i know that's

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,840
nine years ago yeah

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,640
anyways but yes but the french store has

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,679

um i think it was budgie i think it was

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,480
budgie a long time because it looked all

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,279
it would go fly and cool okay very nice

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,919

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,960
streams

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,520
on youtube where he

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,600
goes through the development and it's

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,200
really cool to also see like all the

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,720
like i think it started with wimpy and

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,120
popey but we've got

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,159
like we've got some people i know on our

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
team and on

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,840
other teams and we really want to kind

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,799
of like if you

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,320
stream either on ubuntu or twitch or

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,440
odyssey or wherever

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,039
let us know and man we want to plug your

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,919
channels and follow them

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,000
and stuff because it's so fun seeing

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,360
people like actually

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,240
like live code and develop live and you

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,720
know have a

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,679
little peanut gallery in the back saying

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
oh you

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,240
had a typo there but it's

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,600
it's a really interesting experience but

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,080
i think it's cool this kind

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
to kind of you're right see how

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
everything

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,760
gets made totally it's a it's a weird

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
concept though right because this is the

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,720
same kind of thing that's happened on

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,159
like on tv shows and other streams

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,880
there's people watching other people do

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,559
things

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,320
it's it's weirdly entertaining you know

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,760
you can just sort of sit back and

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,080
see what they're doing i like it

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,960
and it's just it's it's funny because i

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,360
think in my

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,399
little blog post like i i really didn't

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,600
even get onto twitch before

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,120
last summer when wimpy started doing

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,880
gaming streams and then my husband got

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,399
into twitch djs which are

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,840
kind of awesome it's like live music and

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,120
you don't have to leave your

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,480
your like office chair and so my

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,240
poor bank account because oh my gosh

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
like i'll just start like throwing out

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,799
gift subscriptions

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,640
and like tipping the performers and then

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,799
afterwards you're just like oh crap

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,840
i need to buy groceries still so

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,480
yeah but it's just as far as community

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,399
building

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,080
it's so and i know that there's probably

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,159
streams where people are

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,080
kind of super toxic and thank you all

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,480
for being really chatty and awesome

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,440
and i haven't had to ban any of you

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
which

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,159
great job um but

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,000
it's just it's these warm inviting

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,039
places where people are just like

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,360
welcomed in and and i think that's

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,640
one of the reasons why we were like well

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,120
let's try twitch

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
and besides the fact that yes it's

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,320
really cool to be able

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,039
to one day bridge irc the irc channel to

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,720
twitch and so you'll be able to see

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,519
all the conversation going back and

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,840
forth but it's just fun because okay

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,200
i know some of you who are subscribed to

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,720
cool channels have like

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,279
there's oh i don't have i'm thinking of

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,360
my other

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,799
account because we empty has some of his

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,200
emoji of like wimpy making a sad face

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
and

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,480
wouldn't be doing the thumbs up as the

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,880
emoji you get if you're a subscriber and

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,919
it's just great to throw those out into

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,480
a stream

00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,159
so yeah yeah it's he's

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,320
for for people who don't know wimpy is

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,279
is martin press he's um

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,159
he's he used to work he's an ex-genomic

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,320
and uh

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,679
started a punchy mate he's one of the

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,079
most extra people

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,079
it's amazing because he because he has

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
those extra emojis and he did did all of

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
the

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,159
overlays and the starting screens and so

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,520
on and when we

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,720
when um 2010 came around the uh groovy

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,679
gorilla release

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,119
we uh sort of did a uh i guess it was

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,399
almost a live stream together

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,320
to talk about the release into all of

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,919
these things together and i

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,520
joined five minutes before when he set

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,000
everything up at obs you do i need all

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,000
the extra

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,760
things going and it was just it was

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,800
great it was good

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,879
yeah and especially and that's oh that's

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,679
definitely something that i think we

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,960
want to do

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,720
is because it definitely is being a

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,560
streamer on

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,919
linux is a little bit of a challenge

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,440
because a lot of the stuff

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,440
doesn't play

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
with linux right out of the box you kind

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,320
of have to cajole it

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,280
into doing things but i think one cool

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,839
thing

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,920
that wimpy's done is that he's shown

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,599
what with

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,400
obs and a whole lot of patience and

00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,480
experimenting that people

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,839
like eric aka our podcast have picked up

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,040
on

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,880
that you can be a linux

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,640
streamer and have these extremely

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,240
professional looking productions

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,800
and the obs snap that he's put in

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,200
so much work into this makes it all

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,720
extremely handy so you get those cool

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,760
overlays and alerts and all kinds of

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,040
things

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,119
and i'm still kind of learning you know

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,359
figuring everything out but like

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,760
yannick um is actually working

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,440
on oh and this would actually reese this

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,119
will go well with your raspberry pie

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
stuff he is working on making

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,320
uh what he calls a stream berry

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:15,839
which is which is a diy stream deck

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,839
running off of a raspberry pi very cool

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
running ubuntu or would it be running

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,280
raspberry pi os do you know do you know

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,680
oh well let's ask yannick in the twitch

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,839
chat

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,839
i think it's running ubuntu

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,800
that's really cool that's really cool so

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,359
ubuntu mate

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,079
of course of course uh what else what

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,160
else would it be

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,520
yeah there isn't so there isn't a nice

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,720
usability but martin's tutorials

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,320
empowered me to make

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,760
my r-related projects look so much

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
better than before that's

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,119
that's awesome presumably you've told

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,400
him and he knows that but

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,079
that's just really yes yeah

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,560
but it's just nice because you get kind

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,800
of that one person who

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
not only does it but goes through and

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
shows people

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,440
like how they set up their obs and how

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,560
they set up

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,119
their equipment and their desk

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,079
and then it's just that we have gotten

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,280
three people

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,320
from the ubuntu mate team

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,760
or like that circle

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,000
who now stream so wow yeah

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,880
and it's just which is fun it's a kind

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,640
of stupid expensive hobby if you start

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,400
looking into some of the stuff it's like

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,079
oh let's get some key lights oh wait

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,119
this costs 200

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
each but or yeah

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,320
but i think it's a deep expensive rabbit

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,240
hole it's good

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,920
it is but what's nice is that and i

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,839
think that what projects

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,000
like yannick show is that if you diy it

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,400
it doesn't have to be and it can still

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,240
look really cool

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,320
oh i you need to do that diy

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,560
key light thing because yeah those i

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,040
need better lighting but i am not going

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,079
to pay

00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,280
like 600 for a complete

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,320
lighting set so yeah

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,520
oh yeah so i think that we could and so

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,800
i think that

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,200
we oh where did we start with this

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,560
anyway that we'd love to do

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,960
um office hours where we have

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,400
a theme of you know how to start

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,760
streaming

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
you know and it's whether you want to

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,560
show gaming it's like i have ones where

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,839
i

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,040
threw a freaking tea party for um

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,440
pursuit hippo so which was

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,720
which luna was at and it was really fun

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,079
but you can stream anything and i think

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,880
kind of

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,760
getting more the ubuntu community who

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,760
wants to

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,880
do that you know having them feel like

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,920
they're able to

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,040
would be pretty awesome absolutely and

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
how they feel like they'd be able to and

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,079
have them feel like we'll talk about it

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,160
on here right on the

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,000
ubuntu thing it's not very big at the

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,440
moment but we'll definitely hopefully

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,480
we'll get some more listeners and we'll

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
start talking about other different

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,599
streams because what we really want out

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,680
of all of these things right

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,200
is to have people start doing things and

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,880
start getting on with things so if if

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,720
you need a little bit of a how-to we can

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
do a little bit of a how-to and then

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,480
hopefully get people streaming and

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:18,079
talking and and doing things

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,200
yeah and so oh luna we definitely will

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,160
and speaking of so i don't know if you

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,320
all heard that

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,839
door that was like the person pounding

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,480
at the door where i had to leave

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,839
well um in my twitch streamer life

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,400
woohoo you know where i stream cat games

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,200
and making cross-stitch stuff my

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,560
nickname is

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,079
community time because i like tea

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,640
and i really like puns so i got

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:51,599
some tea for that and i got this cup

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,880
which i think for ubuntu is kind of

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,920
awesome because i don't know

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,800
about all of you but with the ubuntu

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,359
animals

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,040
there's a lot of ubuntu merchandise that

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,119
isn't actually open to

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,200
merchandise but if it has the name of

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,359
one of the animals

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,200
it is so i got this

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,440
for warty warthog our very first

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,720
i got the smug oh very cool

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,760
so i think that this is going to become

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,200
my um yeah

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,480
and so this is going to become my

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,680
teacup for future streams so

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,319
it's just it's super adorable

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,240
and if you're in the states it's from a

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,359
place called the new mexico tea

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,160
company any and i even got

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,400
a decaf earl grey so i can have some

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,119
earl grey and not be up until like two

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,119
o'clock in them

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,480
oh yeah i feel great i don't i don't i

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,319
don't know what you're talking about

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,240
that's not a thing ah

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,119
okay for those of us who are caffeine

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,760
sensitive though

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,560
i mean trust me i wish i wasn't because

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,760
it is a

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,000
pain but it is nice to have those things

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
so

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,960
i'm so when i realized it was my tea box

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,359
i'm like i can show my cup

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,880
during the office hours and that's going

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,000
to be awesome

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,920
tea earl grey decaf exactly

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,040
i just i just want to just i'm gonna

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,079
roll back a couple of

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
couple of things because um uh i'm gonna

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,319
say the name wrong but

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,760
gelath o'neill give ethernet someone

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,760
over on the youtube chat said we need

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,359
more love for buntu's server

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,440
because he doesn't use google desktop

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,400
they don't use a video desktop but wsl

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,079
beyond wsl

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,760
i think that's great i agree i think we

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,640
need everyone needs more love for ubuntu

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,480
server because

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,720
it doesn't get enough attention and it's

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,160
great i have another setting world

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,599
it powers what was it it was a really

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,720
nice tagline that someone said at a

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,240
conference once there was

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,760
clouds aren't made of aren't made of

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,960
water vapor they're made of ubuntu and

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,440
they're made of a bunch of server and

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,040
it's

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,640
it's really really good so yes that

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,280
needs to be that needs to be

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,960
it should be right that needs to be a

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,960
t-shirt oh my god that's great

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,960
okay cool sorry if

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,520
the i i do think the youtube chat is a

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,880
little bit

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,560
quieter than the twitch chat if you

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,440
wanted to head over to twitch or to the

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,359
irc thing

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
but obviously we can still we can see

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,240
your messages in

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,200
youtube anyway so yeah and also and

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,760
our podcast is just offered and i think

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
we should totally take him up on this

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,200
that if we want an office hour on

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,800
getting started with data science

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,760
analysis using ubuntu and r

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,280
yeah i think that's we will thank you

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
awesome

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,640
yeah and especially that might dovetail

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,720
well with some stuff with us

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,160
and databases later on this year

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,920
with databases down the road and

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,000
hopefully some some other

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,359
data analytics uh stuff down there if i

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
can convince the

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,800
the people who are trying to convince to

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,800
do it

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,160
yeah i know yeah we are very persuasive

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,160
people when we want to be

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,000
yeah and so really it's just and also

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,440
just knowing kind

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,720
of things that yes we will have online

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,079
release parties and i think having

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,960
things like all these

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,680
really awesome community and initiatives

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
i know

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,440
luna is one of ours um luna

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,319
and yannick here in the twitch chat are

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,960
two of our translators one for

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,440
swedish and one for french and we have

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,640
this

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,480
really great group of portuguese

00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,599
translators who work with ubuntu

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,520
mate we have people who oh my gosh from

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,560
all over the globe who

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,560
over the past my good

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,760
many many years have translated for the

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,480
ubuntu project

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,960
and so having people from all the

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,760
different

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,079
ways that you can contribute to have

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,880
them

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,520
on and you know not only to talk about

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,400
what they do

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,440
but maybe to have a thing like a

00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,800
translation jam

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,400
yeah absolutely translation translation

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
workshop something like that

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,920
i know i know you're i know you're

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,520
probably biased because you're

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,359
you started in ubuntu mate and all of

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
these things but you always make it

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,480
sound like there's always

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,920
there's always conversation in the

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,599
market community which is great

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
but is there how does that how does that

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,760
sort of manifest itself or is it similar

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,760
to

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,520
the discord the bluetooth discourse and

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,280
and this kind of thing or is it

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,440
are you doing something different that

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,680
was interesting because

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,000
the especially how we got connected with

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,280
the portuguese translators

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,319
was through diego constantino who is

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,319
awesome and he is if you've ever been to

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,200
one of the ubu khan

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,920
europe's i am a really jealous of you

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,680
because i

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,880
really wanted to go to the 2021 and then

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,760
poof um but he has organized

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
a lot of those he's super active in the

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,599
ubuntu portugal community but also the

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,359
broader

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:13,200
european um ubuntu community

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:16,839
and he we'd been chatting on to

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,640
telegram and so he knew i was involved

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,800
with mate and so he

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,760
invited me to come speak at the ubuntu

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,880
portugal

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,880
meeting which in is you know

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,720
kind of easy peasy because all i had to

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,440
do was sign on to

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,599
a video chat i mean i would have so much

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,720
rather been on a plane

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,520
to l lit it's been i mean that would

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,800
have been awesome

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,760
but it's not happening not happening yet

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,640
and then so we got to chat with a lot of

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,599
um

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,079
with some of the people in that

00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,040
community

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,599
and just because i knew of what

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,000
translation opportunities were available

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,119
with

00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,160
our project i was able to be like oh hey

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,440
here i can point you towards here but

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,040
but i think especially with you know

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,079
possibly having you know

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,359
with the new flutter and

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,680
the new flutter installer and also

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,640
whatever new apps might come there's

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,599
going to be

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,000
there's always more opportunities to

00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,680
translate

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,440
and i know that that's one of the things

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,839
that we

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,800
it's on our roadmap is to have better

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,200
kind of getting started documentation we

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,319
know

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,359
i know when i joined the com

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,960
unity that it was sometimes really hard

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,319
to find out where to get

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,440
started we know that our whit icky is

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,680
kind of old and some of the info there

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,359
like you get really excited by a group

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,920
and then you realize that they haven't

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,280
been anything for like five years

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,920
and so we know that and i was very

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,800
fortunate to have a friend who could

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,440
kind of be

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,640
a mentor who could help me through the

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,599
process

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,440
but if you don't have that it it can be

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,040
hard when we want to make that

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,359
better and so i think that that that can

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,440
also be something that we

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,319
highlight in these streams and help

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,079
people get started it's like hey i'm

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,240
and also there might be a way you might

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,680
want to contribute that we haven't even

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,280
thought of yet

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,559
and like absolutely that's that's a huge

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,880
thing right i was really

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,400
so some of one of the things that uh we

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,000
both are working on right is

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
is that onboarding process for it

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,480
specifically for the the ubuntu proper

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,920
um community getting all that on

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,880
boarding and that's sort of how we did

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,880
get started stuff

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,559
going and i was doing some research and

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,640
there was there was this wonderful

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,440
um article i'll see if i could find it

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,800
afterwards by someone over at github

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,079
and they were talking about all the ways

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,720
people contribute to github and they

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,880
were saying

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,920
just like anything else in tech how

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,319
people contribute

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,000
changes and and new things come along so

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,760
quickly that we probably can't imagine

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,040
the way in which people will be able to

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,480
be able to contribute to these kind of

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,480
projects soon right because you can

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,000
think of translating documentation

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,400
code and bugs right those are pretty

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,240
classic then you can do designs you can

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,280
do write blog posts and how to's and

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,480
tutorials

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,640
or you could go further you could do

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,720
like games or or

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,160
video things like this or who else who

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,960
knows what else

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,599
organizing events i don't know but

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,760
things

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,520
things that aren't considered things

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,839
that we haven't thought of yet

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,280
are super interesting to me as to what

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,640
they would be considered contributing

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,960
into in the future right

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,880
if anyone has ideas of weird ways of

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,960
contributing not weird but

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,960
unusual ways i'd love to hear them

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,559
oh would this maybe be a good thing to

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,160
maybe put out

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,920
the email address that maybe people can

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,920
send their ideas in because we should

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,720
have or else you know post them on

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,000
discourse ooh actually i like kind of

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,760
maybe we should set up

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,079
a category on discourse

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,680
but you rock band would be amazing maybe

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,720
we should let's let's do that now

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,480
i'll get a i'll do a subcategory in the

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:14,079
community category

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:17,280
awesome and yeah that sounds really cool

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,400
oh eric okay that's really cool he was

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,520
talking about that

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,760
um that there were some

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,040
r packages that had simple gooeys

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,319
written in gtk

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,720
or qt so he thought about

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,520
maybe doing some of that but with

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,559
flutter

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,480
that actually would be very cool and

00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,760
yannick i would recommend talking to the

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,760
ubuntu studio

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,760
about the rock band

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:49,440
yeah and jono does have the

00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,319
band oh really does he but

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,800
is it is it still is it an ubuntu no

00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,319
it's not

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,200
it's a baron it's baron

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,400
something or other god i only follow him

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,319
on twitter and

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,319
jono if you're listening to this we're

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,800
sorry we forgot the name of your band

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,480
so but i mean if someone wants to start

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,119
on ubuntu rock band and then there's

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,119
jono's

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,800
band and then we just need one or two

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,880
more and we can have a bat at a battle

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,599
of the open source bounce

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,319
would be great no no no then like we

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,640
pull in

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,319
like you know we invite all the other

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,880
people like to have a

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,760
oh i think fedora though should have

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,160
like a jazz band

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,680
like one of those like like one of those

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,520
classy like 1940s like jazz bands

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,000
yeah absolutely yeah that actually would

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,440
be

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,559
very cool so if you're from the fedora

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
project and you're

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,480
listening to this and happen to know

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,680
some trombonists and saxophone players

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,040
and a trumpet and

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:54,000
maybe a basic guitar

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,480
yeah get those people together ubuntu

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
got

00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,720
talent uh ian i believe

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,640
ian i think it was ian had an idea

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,440
similar to opium who's got talent over

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,079
on

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,040
uh over a discourse where he what was it

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,040
it was oh goodness

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,400
something really cool it was ubuntu um

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,319
showcase day or something like that

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,079
where we would do a stream like this and

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,480
we would talk about everybody's projects

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,839
and

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,000
and things it would be effectively and

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,280
eventually got talent and i it got a lot

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,079
of uh support in the forum and so i i

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,839
imagine

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,319
something like kavindy's got talent

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,760
isn't far away from the cards

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,680
let me find out what it was called

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,280
that's right really not

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,720
yeah it was called the ubuntu film

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,160
festival

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,240
yes that was that was really cool

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,480
and especially since you upload those

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,040
and those can just kind of run

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,640
so exactly yeah so it doesn't have to be

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,079
a live stream because not everyone likes

00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,480
being on camera and all of these things

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,559
and

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,920
we can definitely facilitate some kind

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,040
of pre-recorded

00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,800
stuff and then if it's pre-recorded

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,480
you can always be in the chat as well so

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,880
you can have your video playing and

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,880
answer people's questions great great

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,520
time

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,680
oh yannick was saying that adafruit does

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,359
that every week they invite people to

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,720
show off the projects they built with

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,240
adafruit's

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,240
products oh wow how does that

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,079
every week just is there always is it

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:26,000
one person every week or is there

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,000
multiple people i feel like that's a lot

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,520
but well well they answer that yep oh

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,960
wow yeah okay

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,920
that's pretty impressive i'll check that

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,640
out people multiple people that may

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,520
make sense to kind of spread the load a

00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,640
bit

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,559
oh and definitely i was thinking that

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,440
oh my gosh my i when i started my

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,960
transition

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:54,480
into tech because i came out of academia

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:59,119
and then switched to tech open source

00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,040
and so data analytics was kind of where

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,559
i thought i would go first

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:08,160
and so but i think kind of doing

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,440
like kind of scraping of like for forums

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,800
to kind of see

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,920
that what things are coming up

00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,240
and so because there are a lot of places

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,880
for us to follow

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,599
and there's i mean there's so many

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,000
forums

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,839
and you know and all these kinds of

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,960
things and so to

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:32,000
be to kind of have an eye on

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,920
on that but not in a creepy surveillance

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,200
sort of way but in a cool

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,280
sciency sort of way yeah

00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,160
and yannick that's interesting that

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,640
sounds kind of like a lightning talk

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,200
almost or like more like in like

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,280
lightning talk slash

00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,880
elevator pitch

00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,960
just to just get some visibility that's

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,800
really good i really i really

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,480
i really enjoy everything i really enjoy

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,839
other adafruit's

00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,280
thing i really enjoy what they're doing

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,640
i didn't know about these these things

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,720
that it's really good of them

00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,400
is is there's also streaming on twitch

00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,119
this is also streaming on twitch

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,319
uh twitch.tv slash google 100 if you

00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,720
want to go and find that

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,400
now i've immediately forgotten i've

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,920
entirely forgotten what category i was

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,680
creating on this course

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,119
oh my god do you remember what we said

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,119
uh it was

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,000
yeah okay this is not just me that's

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,720
good that makes me

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,880
oh it was either something i think like

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,079
maybe

00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,599
ways i it was maybe for ways to con ways

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:39,040
to contribute that we haven't

00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:40,799
considered right right okay

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,559
we'll just call it ways to contribute

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:47,040
the other thing we need to do is

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,040
that tweet about the desktop in dhamma

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,040
because we can work on stream since this

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,680
is the office

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,680
oh yeah oh and we have to tell them our

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,079
technical

00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:01,599
difficulties before we close this stream

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,040
you you right you do that i'll i

00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,319
i gave us i think i gave a brief thing

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
but you do that i'll finish this

00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,040
category and

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,079
compose a tweet and see what you think

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,359
excellent

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,559
so yeah so right now uh one of us is

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,599
doing audio

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:19,599
through stream yard one of us

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:24,400
is doing audio through google me because

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:27,520
it it it it doesn't work in both place

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,799
uh in both places for us so like

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,480
i can't hear rhys in stream yard

00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:37,760
he can't hear me in google hangout

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,040
so we had to oh hey nate

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,079
and um and corian awesome

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,839
uh so we totally had to hack this

00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,240
together because we tried to figure that

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,720
out

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,079
for 20 minutes we restarted our

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,160
computers

00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,680
um we're actually not doing this through

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,000
obs

00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,599
ninja we're doing this straight through

00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,640
stream yard

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,880
so which we figure is a little which

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,480
i think for multiple people is a little

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,880
bit easier to

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,480
handle i really hope my audio doesn't

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,440
screw up tomorrow though

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,040
just saying but then reese has a

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,079
brilliant idea that we

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:19,440
could keep um meet open

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,280
just for voice and so yeah and we

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,160
figured that out what was about two

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,200
minutes left

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:28,799
before the stream was going to start

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,400
so oh you know

00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,880
if if somebody can just kick or ban the

00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,079
unwise geek just you know we don't need

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,799
that kind of

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,000
negative comments here for any of you

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:44,799
who don't know that's my

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
husband so i am allowed to be sassy to

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,040
him

00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,040
so yeah

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,599
so someone could we should we should

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,640
give someone moderator access so they

00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:01,280
can kick it

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,470
i can't i don't have the crown yeah oh

00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,920
my gosh

00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:07,440
[Music]

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,720
if one of you ever want to invent like a

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,319
a way to to stream via you know

00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:18,000
your favorite like text editor

00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:20,960
of choice more power to you i think

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,960
on the ubuntu podcast telegram group

00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,640
someone had a thing with that converted

00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,640
like video to ascii

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:33,520
so i'm sure somebody can

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,520
hack something together and just yeah

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,520
that would be hilar aries but we

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,880
probably as

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:45,359
especially as we we grow i think we will

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:48,160
ask people and to be moderators what

00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,920
also um what tends to happen i mean you

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,240
all have been

00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,000
fantastic and wonderful

00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,280
but you get these spammers who are like

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,720
hey you should buy

00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,119
followers it's like we're not going to

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,280
go for affiliate anyway because trust me

00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:05,200
we don't want to be saying

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,240
don't forget this subscribe and thanks

00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,280
for the bitties

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,079
and our emojis wouldn't be nearly as

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,640
cool

00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,640
just saying

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,680
but um but yes but that might be another

00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,640
way that you could possibly contribute

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,079
is to be

00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:27,280
a moderator on youtube and twitch

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:32,240
and just ban people who need to be

00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,240
banned thankfully

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,400
what none of you can look at base64 and

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,040
see the images that were

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,480
encoded come on the people in the matrix

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,559
could look at a green screen of

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,839
characters and see people wandering

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,839
a round oh there is a thing

00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:54,720
on oh what is it the um

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,000
oh i should know this it's the camera

00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,520
tool that we

00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:04,480
use but it has a matrix-like effect

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:08,000
so i'll have to use that the next time

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,640
okay so yeah so gorion if you hang out

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,119
on twitch

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,880
and subscribe to people's channels one

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,680
of the things you get is a subscriber

00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,799
benefit

00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,720
is emotes and

00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,720
so unfortunately i don't have them here

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,520
the next one i will sign in for my

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,440
primary

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,839
account and bombard you all with a

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,040
gazillion emotes that are mostly about

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:33,040
music and cats a couple

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:35,839
imp ones mostly music and cats

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,359
um but yeah there's all but they're all

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,920
super cute

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,640
and you get to kind of just put them in

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,160
your chat

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:46,000
so i've i know what's funny is because i

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,319
grew up with the ascii

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,359
characters too but i do love me like

00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,079
some you know

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,960
little cute cat stickers of them like

00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,480
you know

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,680
hugging a heart or like jamming to music

00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,160
it's yeah so that's why i i know it's

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,880
interesting

01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,119
twitch kind of seems like it can be for

01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,000
the news and the olds

01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,040
i don't know so i think so i think so

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,960
because it's a really

01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,280
easy thing to get into and as long as

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,960
you can as long as you find

01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,280
as long as you find the buttons to press

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,240
but i guess that goes with anything

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,280
yeah yeah like this past week i just

01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,359
discovered i don't know

01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,599

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,520

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,119

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,839
live schedule that links to a google

01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,839
calendar

01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,839
if you just want to even sync that into

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,480
yours so you never miss one

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,799
or well you you missed one but you at

01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,440
least knew it was going to happen

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,079
but next week's community office hours

01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,319
will be the

01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,160
early one so we're going to stagger

01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,400
we're going to have apac

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,240
emea friendly ones and then we're going

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,680
to have emea

01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,880
uh america's friendly ones

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,640
because y'all know we we are global

01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,559
trying to find a time that works for

01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,640
everybody is super super hard

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,240
and this is and that's not just for

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,000
viewers but that's so

01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,839
people from all different time zones

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,920
will be able to use the

01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,200
use the platform and do all three things

01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,039
because um

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,480
like you'll see i'm sure in the in the

01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,920
coming weeks um

01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,400
all of the streams will be at slightly

01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,880
weird times or maybe not very consistent

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,440
times

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,119
but that's because um people from all

01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,119
over the all over the world will be

01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:57,760
hopefully will be using the using the

01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,920
channel and talking about things

01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,000
awesome and yes and all of these even

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,480
though twitch only saves videos

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,400
for a couple days since these are going

01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,599
to youtube as well

01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,119
we will get a playlist for office hours

01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,520
up there and they will stay up there

01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,280
until somebody crashes and burns their

01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,920
cert over so hopefully for a long time

01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,400
hopefully for a long time exactly yep

01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,119
awesome

01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,799
so yeah so that way if you miss it then

01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,520
and if you don't get to watch it till

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,559
like the week

01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,280

01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,640
habit of going over on these things i

01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,119

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,559
