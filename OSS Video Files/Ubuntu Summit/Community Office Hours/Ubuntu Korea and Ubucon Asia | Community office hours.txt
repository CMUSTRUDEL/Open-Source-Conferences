noticed monica isn't with me today

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,800

on uh pto she's on a bit of a vacation

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
but otherwise she's got some time off um

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760

that when i was very young when i was a

happy because that oh yeah buying

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
a compact disc would mean that i could

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
donate

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
that was first experience on ubuntu

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,960

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,800
until now how have things how have

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,479
things changed what's the uh

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
what's the state of things are you still

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,520
doing a lot of drinking when you're

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,800
when you're doing your community meetups

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,479
um unfortunately um because of coffee

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,840
night with a drink

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,840
okay oh yeah of course uh

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
uh yes sir i remember there was always

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,680
uh dream time

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,960
after the uh some regular events

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,000
uh i remember uh there was uh usually

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,680
um regular seminar uh

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
about was uh two bone uh like was it two

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
months

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
i i remember and you saw i'm talking

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,159
about that

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,839
using ubuntu to run uh something like

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,279
doing uh ai things or runner server

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,320
obviously talk about that and you also

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,279
have some

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
like uh joint meetups uh like we also

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,600
have some

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,680
joint fancy the open stick or

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,000
like uh yeah

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
it's so awesome it sounds like it sounds

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,680
like the openstack

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,040
uh community was a very big part of the

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
ubuntu career community that's not

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
something you see everywhere else

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,440
what is it what why is the uh openstack

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,040
user group so closely knit to the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,880
ubuntu community do you think yeah

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,560
uh first of all then so lots of

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,920
so passionate we went to korea community

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,680
active members and uh uh

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,040
became uh openstack career

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,480
organizers so one member i

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,880
clearly remember is that the guy is

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,440
sanji and then he has been translating a

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,800
lot

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,519
for ubuntu so that when

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
when he became one of open state korea

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,640
user group organizers

00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,080
he was leading a translation

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,000
for open state from english to korean

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,040
so that after that thanks to him that

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
i learned a lot more and more for

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
example than

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
uh in openstack world and we have been

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,440
initially using trench effects

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,760
now then we are using janata but however

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
then i didn't know at the time that what

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,440
launchpad

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,880
is for example but he kindly more

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,200
shared that oh yeah in ubuntu then many

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,440
uh there are so many translators who are

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,480
using launchpad for translation so

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,560
i could a lot also then thanks to him

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,160
then i could contribute something

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,600
not only for translation so uh but also

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,720
how to communicate with other uh trans

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,000
translation team members so i became a

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
uh openstack i18 internationalization

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,560
project team lead

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,839
for almost two years

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,640
in 2017 and then yeah i

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,000
also could learn a lot for example how

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
to sell me bugs on

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
launchpad so then so i

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,760
more knew that oh yeah ubuntu and

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,800
in between openstack and ubuntu and then

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
the contribution way is very similar and

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,959
also then lots of trans

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
translators could communicate each other

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,320
their new house

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,360
so that we have been co-organizing

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,880
how to contribute upstream sources

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,279
and how we encourage translations

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
so then we have been organizing some

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
meetups

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,160
and also then some uh local sprints

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
in offline before copying 19 uh two to

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
ten

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,760
let's translate together just for a few

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,519
hours like that

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,839
so it was super a happy experience for

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,079
me

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,040
and then it was also happy to work

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,480
closely work with youngbin

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,839
and that all happens you still do that

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,040
on launchpad and that's all still

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
ongoing you're still part of the

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,639
translations team

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,880
uh currently then uh i

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
strongly believe that still then all the

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
translations in ubuntu is

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
still happening uh with the launchpad

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
for

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,360
openstack them uh we try to pursue

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
how which platform would be more open

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
and open so

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,120
but right now janata platform uh is not

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
evolving anymore so

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,040
we are finding uh alternatives hopefully

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
then we can find

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,040
uh new platforms but right now then we

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
are still using data

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,440
but for bulk tracking issue tracking on

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
translation issues then we are still

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,399
using launchpad very well

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,440
cool okay that's really interesting um

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,560
yeah okay great

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,839
so um you you both have been involved in

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
organizing these kinds of

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
uh local community meetups and these

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
little community events

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
uh and yong bin you mentioned before

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
that you didn't get involved in the

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,560
organizing of these things until maybe

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,360
um 2016 is that right oh yeah right

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
yes i wanted i wanted to ask um what

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
sort of

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
what sort of problems have you run into

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
what sort of issues have you had when

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
you've been trying to set up these

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
global events

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
in the ubuntu community and how you and

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,079
how you sort of dealt with those issues

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
uh yes sorry uh um uh uh when i first

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
started to

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,800
try to think about organization events

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,079
um

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,279
i remember it was uh last fall

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,000
um but i was always uh

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
wanting to see the we're going to asia

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,079
events

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,120
because um also i see some

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,120
events like open source asia

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,240
and i also uh have i also attended the

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,600
dev conf 18 uh and taiwan

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,040
and but i didn't really saw the uh

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
good asia events that gathered the

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,760
ubuntu communities

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,920
around asia and i also just knew the uh

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
what kind of things are other

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,720
communities in

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,839
asia do so i want to know the uh what

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,240
kind of activities they do

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,240
so the after the kobe 19

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
uh so many many conferences turn online

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,959
so

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,040
i think it would be a great chance to uh

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,360
try uh online conference uh

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
because everybody uh easier than the

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
just

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,560
open event uh it doesn't need any uh

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,920
huge venue or

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,959
just need a lot of money so uh i try to

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,880
start to reach out some community

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,920
communities but um i first started

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,720
from the japanese team because we have

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
some

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
uh we already have some experience with

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
exchanging

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,440
with the communities uh so from japan

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,959
and

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,199
then we tried to uh contact taiwan team

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:57,040
and china but uh that was the uh

00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,560
that the problem started from there are

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,079
we we uh we tried to find their

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,199
contact address from the local portal

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,399
uh which we can find the every

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,600
list of the local community teams there

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
but i will try to contact with the email

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,399
uh

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
i could view the uh we shall reach out

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
them because

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,279
uh maybe there they would be busy or

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
maybe

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,079
uh their inbox would be

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:31,199
so uh and the first time it looked it

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,120
it was difficult to uh like

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,160
uh reach out so i tried another way to

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,160
contact them uh i tried to

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,320
find their the black facebook because uh

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
your career comes to also uh promote our

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,440
activities on the

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,759
social medias so i tried to contact with

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,000
the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,959
social medias and so then i could uh

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,120
get connected with the taiwan team and

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,160
for the chinese team uh

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,279
i trade uh you know i chose i told you

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
that i've been to

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,759
opensuse asia i met some i also made

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
some

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,720
people from the china so i

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,839
i firstly have to get in touch with the

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
chinese team

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
so then i could connect those three

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,199
teams and

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,480
then i i i sent to

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,040
uh some if you know some other people uh

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
in the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
other community to um help me to some

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,320
together

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,240
and i also uh i remember also

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,000
actually some publish some i thought

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,560
uh so that i'm looking for the

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,600
organizations that on the discourse

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,040
and oh yeah well yeah right uh after

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,639
that uh

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,600
i could uh get a lot of organizers from

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,880
the

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,920
various regions like uh i could also uh

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,680
gather from the hong kong uh malaysia

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,639
and uh also some some some communities

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,959

i really also uh i just want to add

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,640

was doing or were doing military service

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
in korea that everyone should go for

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,880
army so

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,640
before young went to army service for

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
almost two years

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,400
so then youngbin was also one of very

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,919
passionate

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,559
uh community organizers which i really

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,960
appreciate

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,760
uh her or his natural effort because

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,799
then

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,400
in korea then yeah uh

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,440
there are not too many people who uh

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,000
had experiences on uh

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
following conferences by paying by

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
themselves

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,480
so the young uh i remember the young bee

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,840
went to

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,160
maybe taiwan right all right

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,000
yes young bean before going to military

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,200
service young bean went to taiwan

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,320
to see sushi conference i i forgot the

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,760
exact name but

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,720
yeah um i think the uh 2018 i went to

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
uh devconf

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,400
oh yeah thank you yeah

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,080
has been establishing his own network

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,200
in ubuntu area regardless of

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,760
of distributions whether for example

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,440
that

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:23,039
uh i still remember one

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,600
active guy from japan who came to korea

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,320
several times before probably 19.

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
so then youngbin has been building his

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,919
own network

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,640
regardless of distribution platforms

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,679
like

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,799
ubuntu debian or and so on

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,200
so then thanks to this that young being

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,919
uh after coming back from military

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,520
service

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:49,520
then i my feeling from yong bin was that

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,720
young bean wants to meet again

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,640
from those organizers in online so but

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,679
young beans were not sure how

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,799
to organize a online event by

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,000
collaborating

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,520
with more different communities

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,840
because then each for example then

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,799
now then i'm more thinking for example

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,679
when i plan to

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,320
do a more asia regional event and then

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,640
we

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
enlist need to consider which kind of

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,799
online platform best

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
with which platform would be the best

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,799
online platform

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,760
for each country so and also the first

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,120
sponsorship

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,320
one group one main issue is that uh how

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,720
we take care of different currency rates

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,919
or then from uh agencies or suppliers

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,960
perspective then

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,240
they are not sure because

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
we are just a community member then we

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,640
do not operate

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,960
in a kind of companies we are not a ceo

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
and

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,559
we are i'm just a just

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,520
a disclaimer that i'm now working in

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,880
microsoft

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,159
but yeah i'm receiving some

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,200
of salaries so that i could not run

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,000
a kind of a separate company

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,640
so then we should need to think about

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,919
how

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,039
we define sponsorship package

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,280
to discuss with more companies

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
either who would like to sponsor the

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,360
event

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,000
and then also then how we also instead

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,720
of this to

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
establish some plans which date would be

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,240
the due date for sponsorship then which

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,280
day would be for

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,559
powerful papers and then how we

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,360
communicate with other user groups to

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
uh for the best values or for the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
communities

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,320
like that so then yeah

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
me and youngbin just have been uh

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,159
doing lots of conversations that which

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,679
kind of best practices

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,360
would be applicable for his organizing

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,120
upcoming asia in 2021 this year

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
amazing so what have you what did you

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,200
land on what have you come up with

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,360
what's the

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,440
what's the program for sponsorship this

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,559
year

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,360
um we have both the uh the cash

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,200
sponsorship

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,600
and also uh donald cash packages um

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,880
uh cash cash packages are based on our

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,640
budget plans

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,200
uh this is of course uh

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,320
the amount of the package is uh lower

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,039
than the

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
other other uh the offline events

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,640

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,400
who are these people so yeah the left

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,520
is me and then the right

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,039
one is the

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,640
uh previous open stack korea usually

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,039
leader so i'm

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
the third openstack choreographer leader

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,080
and then she

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,520
was the second openstack choreographer

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,840
leader so when

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,640
she was leading openstack korea

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,880
community

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
and then she said to me a lot for

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,600
example that she

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,360
were very active she was very active in

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,279
ubuntu korea community

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:23,600
so then yeah he is in kang

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,960
who also contributed all that on ubuntu

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,400
translation in korean so then he

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,840
his experience was super helpful to

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,200
evolve translations in korean for

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,480
openstack and also that he

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,080
was the previous previous ubuntu

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,760
korea uh community leader so then

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
yeah so that i drank all that separately

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,330
with

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,279
him

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:54,240
[Laughter]

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,559
yeah like that and also that he he is

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,080
jung choy and then he kindly

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,960
uh uh recommended me to become

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:24,000
detail on system operators so then

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,440
he has been investigating a lot how

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,799
uh ubuntu and windows machines can run

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,320
together like that

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,039

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,760
ubuntu meetup in the microsoft build

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,880
event

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,279

uh yeah i i want i also want to share

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,480
this picture

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,840
so yeah we have been co-organizing lots

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,360
of event channels so

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,039
then in korea then how can i say

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,159
there have been many uh offline

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,360
locations from sponsorships for example

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,720
microsoft korea

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,360
or is one of us us

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,120
um sponsors who are supporting the

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,080
venues of flying venues

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,360
and also then uh not only opens the

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,480
korean group also ubuntu korea community

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,600
of sponsorship or for applying place uh

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,200
from neighbor a local big search company

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:43,279
or then korea government so

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,080
yeah one great memory i was that yeah

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,080
how multiple communities share their

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,200
experiences together

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,480
so that at the time the five

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,320
active communities and then uh

00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,360
took the picture together so i had so

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,440
yeah great memories of with that and

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,440
also then continuing this

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:11,360
and then yeah we had several meetings

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,120
so yeah there was a picture

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,720
taken on in 2017 then he was yong bin

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,799
and then it was me

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,159
great and then also then thanks to this

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,279
kind of active collaboration then

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,640
i could become microsoft mvp so

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,000
then i want you to explore which kind of

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,200
topic would be

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,840
great for ubuntu korea community so that

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,120
before then then i was exploring how to

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,399
contribute

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,679
uh upstream associates on ubuntu

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,000
and openstack but after i became mvp

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,720
then i also tried to study

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,080
myself how what are the detailed

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,120
mechanisms on wsl windows subsystem

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
on linux on ubuntu and then for linux

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,080
and then

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:08,159
i could do some live demonstrations

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,120
so then i could execute some wsa also

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,000
then share

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,320
a lot of my personal experiences because

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,840
then

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,159
in reality then we need uh in korean

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
uh language and then we need to take

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
care of

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,399
uh language encoding so then sometimes

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,679
the window windows platform is still

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,880
using

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,600
uh non-utf-8 non-unicode uh

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,799
encoding based method but however then

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,159
now then windows

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,960
is also supporting all uh a lot for

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,559
unicode-based method but there are some

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
there have been some compatibility

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,919
issues

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,760
and also then how yeah i could share

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,760
lots of detailed experiences

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:53,600
it was also one of great

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,200
and and then this was another uh

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,039
picture for example there i did this was

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,240
where i

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,960
the topic then how we create launchpad

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,760
account

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
for the contributions for both openstack

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
and

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,279
ubuntu oh wow that's really great

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
and then people just see that watch the

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,240
video i know where they go and they

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,519
contribute to bluetooth

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,039
i love that yeah and

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,799

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,240
joint depends like

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,640
our activities like and also something

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,679
like

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,279
uh what ian uh told uh

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,120
before like um talking about the

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,480
contributing to the uh

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,840
openstack or ubuntu how to get study

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,120
and then uh we eat some uh

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,360
some people barbecue and also drink a

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,360
lot

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,120
nice

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,679
oh this is the uh distraction of the

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,760
um we naturally started to uh exchange

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,240
with the japanese team from the

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,279
um the qatar june and he's from the

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,279
debian japan

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,279
and japan that's him thanks to him i

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,679
could started to

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,039
build a network with the other

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,559
communities uh

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,039
in near near korea right like opposition

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,519
asia

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,519
and like debian people right there

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,480
barbecue and

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,440
um i did last year uh do you remember

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,640
yeah do you remember

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,519
the uh officers contribute uh sure

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,640
i think we we are the opposite and able

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,480
to uh both

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,960
participate to um to how to uh

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,919
to engage some new contributors for the

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,360
both ubuntu and opposite

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:44,559
i remember for the uh ubuntu team

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,480
we participated as a translation team

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:53,279
to try to engage some new translator

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,559
for the good to korea

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,840
and i remember we also did some

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,559
workshop to how to sign up for the

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,919
launchpad

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,200
and um i think you know the uh it is

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,480
actually uh

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,040
other beholders for the to join the

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,200
uh some team on the launch pad because

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,440
it actually requires some

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,639
uh signing on the we want to call up

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,399
contacts with the

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,200
gpgp you know the uh for newcomers uh

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,800
working with the gpg is uh it's

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,879
difficult right

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,720
so we did we also did some workshop on

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,159
that and then we

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,480
uh um uh

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,440
give people some guidelines on how to

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,079
participate

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,079
the ubuntu translation on launchpad

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,440
and the contribution is actually uh also

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:53,200
um c is also about the

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,639
uh uh at the end of the event

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,359
they also uh demand this uh the new

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,160
people they

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,960
do some presentation what the uh what

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
could

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
uh what kind of thing they learned

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,160
through the program and

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,880
what kind of thing they contributed

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,839
and i think i was very impressed uh by

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,839
the uh

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,839
some newcomers i met on the contributor

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,880
the also

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,839
your cyber event called career community

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,599
date

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,880
uh usually you can it's usually on the

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,680
uh

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,599
on earlier earlier the year like um

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,720
january or february

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,440
the is where the every developer or

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,920
every open source community scatters and

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,640
the beats and we also uh regularly have

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,920
uh

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,160
our outposts there like we can so there

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,079
can be some new people like that

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,839
yeah i see the i see the hat on the

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,040
table and i've seen some stickers before

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,200
and the big banner

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,880
is that all right uh did you did you

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,240
order all of that stuff in the t-shirts

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,839
or does that come

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,040
did we get that from canonical um

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,119
the banner and the uh cap

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,480
banner cap and strap start from the

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,720
chemical

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,920
um for the stickers we use walls from

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,400
the chemical

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:26,000
sometimes we um order our own stickers

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:29,280
to uh to share with people

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,880
you go that's the foundation yep uh

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,880
our religious party assault

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:41,839
and this is the t-shirts uh we ordered

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,839
uh we did group by on this

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,400
cool okay that's really great how um is

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
that the kind of thing that we'll be

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
seeing at

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,720
ubu in asia so let's talk about ubiquin

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,000
asia now is that the kind of thing we'll

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,480
be seeing then

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,880
that similar to all of the events you

00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
just saw

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,560
uh i think i think would

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,160
uh uh maybe i think uh you're like i

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,040
would like to uh

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,160
get the people to uh talk about uh uh

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,160
from the third um

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,760
what kind of activities they do because

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,839
uh

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,240
uh there was they weren't uh they

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,599
weren't uh they're really some

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,880
no exchange because uh between the

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,000
uh local communities in asia so i'd like

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,880
to get to know

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
some get to know each other communities

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,760
there

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,119
and or maybe we can uh talk about some

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,880
basic things so also some what are

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,720
interested uh

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,040
and what kind of things are interested

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,599
on their each region

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,520
and oh uh of course there will be also

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,960

volunteering a lot to create some great

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,680
great structures on the homepage and

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,560
let me share my screen again so

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,960
first of all then this is a homepage for

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,560
ubiquinone asia 2021

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,079

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,880
so ubucon asia is also one of my

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,160
interests

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,920

openstack career days event previously

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,040
but anyway then this homepage is super

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,880
great because

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,520
yeah the date is uh about september but

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,720
however

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,720
that i strongly believe that

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,800
all the uh listeners right now then

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,520
please submit your shift peace

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
and then young beings and also the other

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,040
uh

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,560
uh asia organizers can leave you and

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,480
they may happily accept

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,520
your your propose so

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,440
well one thing i'm very uh happy

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,480
is and in asia event translation is very

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,079
important

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,400
so then yeah so if the homepage

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,880
is very international it supports not

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,720
only english also bahasa

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,240
indonesia also also then korean

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,359
so anyone can contribute translations

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,119
just by making a prerequest in

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,480
iatm uh for your own uber connection

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,920
guitar repository so then yeah

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,640
actually then uh there are i've

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,680
seen that there are so many volunteers

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,920
and then young being

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah this is the youngest latest commit

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,880
like that so

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,280
young beans finally telling a lot how uh

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,079
uh asia organizers can cooperate

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,520
together

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,640
to contribute uh to four better home

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,160
pages

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,839
so this is yeah go ahead yeah

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,880
sorry thank you and this is super great

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,160
and second thing

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,280
i want to add is that yeah although then

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,880
my controller

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,920
is a kind of non-developer so i'm more

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,440
thinking how

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,359
i better uh go to developer committees

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,960
in asia if i speak then how i better

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,839
help developer committees

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,359
i'm not a developer anymore honestly but

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,640
however that before that

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,720
before working in microsoft i have been

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,960
a real developer so i have been

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,640
contributing a lot on open source in

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
openstack and also then

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,760
i was implementing lots of ios

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
applications

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,119
all the network applications like that

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,400
so

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:09,680
i really like code based approach

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,839
so one thing i want to share is

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,040
yeah this is a video template

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:20,240
everyone can think every organizers

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,160
organizer needs to more think how

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,359
we replicate lots of videos for example

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:31,119
when i clone this repository then so

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,560
for example then i cloned this and then

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,640
i just executed npm install

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,440
and npm run build and then out.mp4 file

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,800
is has been generated when i open videos

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,200
to your code

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,680
and then i could see that oh yeah there

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,119
are some logos and also then there are

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,960
some transitions

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,480
and then the result is like this

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,440
yeah or trailer or a pre

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,240
parts like 10 seconds or 20 seconds yeah

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,520
youngbin is

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,480
thinking how he can automate

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,359
a lot to for example let's suppose that

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,760
there are so

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,880
many of the projects and videos for

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,000
ubuntu asia

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,720
and then how to deal with more than 100

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,839
videos

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,240
manually it would be very tough so young

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,480
being

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,800
thinking i learned from this code

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,560
repository say how young bing can

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,000
do more automated work through his

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,040
coding knowledge this is super great so

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,200
i strongly encourage to really

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,880
write more encourage to asia communities

call point calling for speakers uh this

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,880
one is actually translated

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,559
there should be a crime for speakers and

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,839
you can see the details of the um

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,800
cip here what kind of topic you can

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,359

uh submit sessions

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,000
in your local language like korean

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:53,680
or japanese chinese because uh

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,880
i know that uh many people in asia

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,119
especially the cgk region um

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,720
uh they hesitate uh they usually

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,200
hesitate to summit

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,000
session on the uh global event uh

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,960
because they're

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,400
they're not confident with giving speech

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,720
in english

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,400
so they can also some session in their

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,760
own language

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:20,240
and you see the uh

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,720

my details if you click this button

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:37,920
uh you can put your details here

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,599
and after that you can submit your

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:48,720

00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,880
great so that's the that's the uh

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,400
that's the ubucon.asia website and then

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,640
you find your way to

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,160

that's perfect thank you very much for

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,640
sharing that

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,160
i hope i hope you get some submissions

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,720
out of this um

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,680
so the moving on to some questions i saw

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,920
one question come in

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,839
from the chat um that uh that moniker

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,319
asked there let me put it on screen what

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,599
inspired you to actually make ubikon

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,559
asia happen in the first place um

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,000
when i became the uh leader of the

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,200
ubuntu current community

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,800
and the 2017

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,319
um i saw the uh there's a ubucon in

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,079
pasadena

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,880
but i wanted to join with the

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,599
my previous previous committee leader

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
but uh

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,599
there was some limitation uh for joining

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,200
the event but

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:56,319
uh uh that was uh

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,040
it means the uh you know the budget the

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,000
uh

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,000
it requires a lot of budget to uh go to

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,880
the america from korea

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,200
and israel too long to get there i

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,640
thought it would be great to have uh

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,520
some global events near uh near from my

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,640
country

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,119
uh maybe in asia so uh that inspired me

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,079
to

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:22,480
uh um organize the apocalypse event

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,079
and then so you wanted to go to an event

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,079
but you wanted one more local

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,079
so then you got in touch with all of the

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,720
communities that you mentioned before

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:34,000
is that right and then you just you just

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,200
set it up right you just did it

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,040
um yeah well i will i was always

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,240
thinking about uh

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:46,720
uh it would be great to have uh ganesha

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,720
um in 2017. um

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,839
uh then i i when i started to uh

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,240
i think put a trade uh i begin

00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,800
also from last fall uh it was

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,520
difficult to uh begin but um

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,359
well i think uh uh because of the a lot

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,880
of help from the other people

00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:13,520
i think i uh i could gather the uh

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
make the team

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,480
great okay fair enough so it was really

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,359
you wanted to go to an event so you made

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,880
an event

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,559
i like that that sounds really good um

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,839
it looks like it looks like that those

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,720
are all the questions that have come in

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,480
from the

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,079
from the chat besides people saying that

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,720
they really liked the photo of the

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,280
barbecue

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,000

more collaboration through open sources

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,359
and ubuntu

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,640
so ubuntu is really great i still

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,440
have great memories of using ubuntu

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,720
desktop

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,200
with compact risk so that was my

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,240
super great experience because then

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,079
before that

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,960
i thought that linux should be long

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,160
on how from hard disk so i couldn't

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,000
imagine so

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:19,760
that changed the lots of mindset or how

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,960
and then and also in 2012 then i

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,440
were i was in canada at the time that i

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,079
saw

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,559
in korea the actual rhythm still lots of

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,839
people

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,240
