	Rhys and Monica have a lovely chat with Rudy and Ocelot from ubuntu-fr, and learn about how their events (and awesome shirts!) spread the word about Ubuntu.  You can keep the conversation going over on the Ubuntu Discourse: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-office-hours/22487

If any of the discussion today inspires you to write a blog post or contribute in any way please let us know. Weâ€™ll add your link to the description of this video, and promote it through the Ubuntu social medias.
