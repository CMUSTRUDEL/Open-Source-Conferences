and uh yeah what been going on

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,760
oh let's see well we are thoroughly in

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,280
the unpacking stage and eating stuff on

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,719
tables made out of moving boxes

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,000
as far as our community move to

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
libera but everything has gone pretty

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,720
well

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,080
i think and i seriously cannot thank

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,720
the community council and the irc

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
enough for all their work holy crap guys

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,560
you deserve

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,560
way more than pizza and cheap beer which

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
is usually what you give to your friends

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
to help you move

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,799
so is that true and i mean i know that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,360
that's true in these states it's like oh

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
pizza beer is that usually what you give

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
your friends to

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,119
desperately bribe them to help you move

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
pretty much it's beer sometimes it's

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
pizza sometimes it's uh

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
we just everyone just go to the pub and

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
they get no pub dinner that kind of

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
thing you know

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
that would be good but so that's good so

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,720
the move

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
move is good and it looks like things

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
have been moved over there pretty well

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
is that where the community council

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
meeting happened then because i know

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
that happened

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,920
recently yeah well we had we had a

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
very brief one last night to say that it

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
has been a really busy

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
two weeks there is nothing super

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,640
pressing things are actually pretty calm

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
they were taking the night off because

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
which is totally fair because that

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,480
meeting is at 2100

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,120
no 2300 utc we have a couple people from

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
europe on that call which is why i go to

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
those

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,520
meetings so yeah oh and look it we have

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,720
yannick in the twitch chat hello

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,400
so um so that is going well

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,360
we are if you've looked on discourse

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
uh we are hopefully going to be making

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
some progress on maybe making the

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
membership application a little less

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,360
painful

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
which is exciting because reese did you

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,160
have to sign your

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,280
gpg key i i haven't done it yet i'm not

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,239
an official ubuntu member i'm sure

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
we should make you do that on air oh we

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
could do that right that'd be super cool

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
we do that on that only i want to try

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
and use the new system once we get a new

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
system i'll try and give you a

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
new system so i don't have to deal with

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
this gpg

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,879
nonsense i mean it's interesting stuff

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,080
yeah it was it took me like two

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,360
tries and it was oh and it meant me

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
like desperately telegramming my friend

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
bill saying bill

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
walk me through this because i know

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
because i think i asked my

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
husband but he hadn't done it in a while

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
so yeah so i

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,640
am i will be happy to have you test

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
whatever new system we're hopefully able

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
to

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,920
come up with so we're working on that

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
behind the scenes seeing what's feasible

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
but yeah it would it'd be nice to move

i joined the ubuntu

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
the ubuntu communities and the french

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,839
local team

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,120
back in i forgot

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,080
to 2009 something like that wow

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,959
and it was during uh an event of the

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,040
french local team

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,040
which is a ubuntu party

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
i have heard about those parties because

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
i haven't

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,440
been to an ubuntu event in person

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,040
yet yes so yeah so so what were

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,120
uh yet exactly yet being the key word

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,440
um the first one i'm hoping for is maybe

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,519
scale of next year

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,080
but what what are the the ubuntu

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,959
parties and how is and how are they

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,279
different from

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,880
the ubu cons because i'd heard of the

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,519
ubu cons uh

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,279
so before i will just explain really

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
fast what is in the bookcon

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,000
so a nubucon is uh so

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,040
it's an event and we do

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
there are some speakers we will have

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,200
some talk about

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
uh ubuntu related topic for example it

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
could be uh

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
ultim to build your your snap in the

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,519
pipeline i don't know

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,360
it could be how to contribute to this

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,040
project in the ubuntu community or to do

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
something in the community or share

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,880
experience so

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,880
it's really related to ubuntu and a

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,560
direct contribution to

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,360
ubuntu and it's also the moment where

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
you can

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
you can put a face uh

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,200
in front of a nickname you you're

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,720
working or communicating so

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,160
social events are a a huge part of the

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
book on every night you hit together and

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
you

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
yeah you get to know people which matter

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,880
a lot

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,160
so basically this it was not

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,440
so fast but it was an explanation of

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,320
what is in the book and the mutual party

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
is

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
a bit the same thing except the people

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,399
who go in

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,399
are not uh especially ubuntu

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,959
uh um two communities people suggest

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,360

and oh there are people and trans

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200

those are french software association

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
how big so how big do the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
the parties get so they've been going

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
for a long long time since

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,360
you said maybe 2009 when you started but

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,160
how big do those things get

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,639
um i think one of the biggest was the

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
one i joined in 2009 i think it started

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
in 2006

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,440
with like 10 people in a room or

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,200
something like that

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,120
it's probably yeah it it was just

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,519
say hey there was a new release let's

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,639
celebrate uh

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,040
yeah and it's become bigger and bigger

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,639
with

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,040
talking activities so

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:41,279
in 2009 it was like five hundred

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,279
and five five thousand visitors

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,959
but uh we cheated on that one because we

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,079
had a special guest we

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,519
who bring a lot of people uh that guy

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,480
who is a space tourist uh

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,480
marshall ross i don't know

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
that's one of that guy so a lot of

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
people

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
came just to see to see what he will say

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,440
in the talk

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,880
yeah and and that's it

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
so now it's more about two or three

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,800
thousand

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,519
people but it's really a good amount of

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,959
people

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,880
uh regarding the the amount of effort we

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,079
put in promoting the event because we

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,360
don't really promote

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,480
except by two or three tweets

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,720
on the official account and

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,079
why beware a lot of people because we

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,440
are just a

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,560
very good area to us the event which is

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
the biggest

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,560
european science museum name in europe

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,560
which is la citade deseance in paris

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,880
they just allow us to have this event in

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
their

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
place so because there is a lot of

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,320
people going by they see the light

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,320
oh what's that i will just see and

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,839
ubuntu fans or did you have to

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,839
how did they how did they get involved

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,880
so when i joined the event it was to

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,279

i had a laptop with a touchscreen

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,880
and it was not quite working well on

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,199
ubuntu

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
you have to change some kernel config

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,000
and

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,759
it was not for me at that time and

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,759

difficult to click on next button and in

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
the end it was

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
working without doing anything so we

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,680

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080
i think it's

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,120
1804 so it's yes three years and

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,120
okay yep um and

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,960
yeah it was a member of the ubuntu

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,000
affair uh

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,799
team asked me hey you're a designer

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,039
do you want to design a shirt and like a

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,720
lot of designer will do i said

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,679
yes are you sure you want my design on a

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
shirt

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,080
um and uh we just

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,280
never stopped so yeah

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,520
so now do you have of all the designs

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,240
you've done from bionic beaver since

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
then do you have a particular favorite i

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
know

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
they're all like your children you're

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,080
not supposed to have a favorite but you

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,799
have a favorite

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,400
i do have favorites and i have ones that

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,200
i don't really like but i won't tell

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,200
them

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,600
um i i quite like the

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
the hippo but it's always hard to to

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,200
tell with the last one

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,039
uh because it's so fresh so i always

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,360
every time when it's the last one i oh i

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,320
hate it it's so bad

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
it's actually pretty good oh yes it's

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
what's

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,320
awesome thing i've ever done it's the

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,799
best thing

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,440
so you basically track your feelings

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
about

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,840
it so it's exactly like that it's like

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,799
and then with time it's

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,799
uh i would say okay it's it's it's a

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,160
it's a nice design it's okay

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,240
yeah uh but except this one

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
uh i cannot talk about this one because

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,039
it's too soon

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,240
uh i like uh i like the disco but

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,640
it does not treat me well i think

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,760
i don't know if yellow is a bad color

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
for me

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
but uh it's my favorite design and i

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
cannot wear it

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,679
so it hurts my feelings you think you

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,400
cannot

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
you think i worried like two days ago

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280
and i

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
was like all day yeah it could work and

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,400
no it's not

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
working it's not working with me i'm

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,720
sorry

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,240
it's it's a hard collar for a lot of

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,799
skin tones to

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,480
wear but it's not because well clearly

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,679
this means you have a special

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,039
edition shirt in a different color

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,400
that's why this is a black one yeah but

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,200
i i i did not buy it oh no

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,039
i get one free t-shirt uh because i'm

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,880
the designer

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,559
so i took it i took it in yellow and um

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,559
i did not took it in black but i think

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,720
yeah two colors when we took

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,720
when we take a risk it is a good idea

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
that's good for both well well it looks

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,919
the yellow looks beautiful on you rudy

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
so it's fine

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
thank you

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
there we go yeah well i think it's funny

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,400
because

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,760
even though focal fossa was my first uh

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,600

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,559

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,679

bionic beaver actually you did not have

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,000
a

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,840
sticker we started with stickers with ao

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
and amin actually

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
you know it kills me every time you say

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,400
it's a pajama

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
you can do it

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,159
i'm sorry that's sorry born outside of

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,360
the house

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,240
but no but i really just because i

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
i love that animal it kind of killed me

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,880
that everyone's like

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,120
it's pronounced 1910 because eowyn is

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,520
just a beautiful word

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,080
and it's like between that shirt and

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,760
also the artwork that sylvia

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:02,159
ritter did for it which is just

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,640
such an amazing job yeah and we are so

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
lucky to have just these ridiculously

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,120
talented

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,840
designers and artists who contribute

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,400
and make this beautiful artwork so have

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,440
you started thinking about

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,360
impish injury yet i have not actually

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,240
it's in my to-do list for today i have

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,200
to work one hour but

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,600
i did not started really yeah so can you

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,000
like what's the typical process

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:36,400
if there is one for designing a shirt

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,520
uh first it's uh choosing the deadlines

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,799
uh and uh we we say like uh

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,640
this date i show the first first things

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,400
uh we choose uh a way we say well

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,559
roughly we like this one let's go in

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,360
this direction

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,760
third step is actually everything was

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,440
just

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,440
lousy let's do it all over again

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,400
yeah i do it all over again and oh

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,440
actually i like this one better

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,760
and you ignore like two deadlines

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,720
and then you say yeah no it's finished i

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,720
swear it's finished

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,000
i'm not touching that again how when you

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,760
do that process when you do each step

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
is that something that you you talk

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,799
about and you show

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
uh people or is it just an internal

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,960
thing and you just talk

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
amongst yourself it's one of the things

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,480
that

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,720
that makes me keep doing those shirts um

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
i'm not saying it just because rudy is

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,039
here and uh

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,240
i want him to like me but um the

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,000
the fair community people that works

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,120
with me on the shirt

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,840
um there are the people uh who decides

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,240
uh yes we can sell this let's do it this

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,200
way and they trust me a lot

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,600
when i say i know you like this one but

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
i swear it's not a good idea actually i

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,679
i

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
thought i thought about it and it's not

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,320
going to work on a teacher

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,080
they say oh okay you're the designer you

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,080
you you keep going and

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,400
it's it's not a paid job so if

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,440
i didn't have this freedom i would not

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,200
keep going

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,559
probably because i need

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,159
to have my fun in this outfit but

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:32,720
they really i know when i

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:35,679
show i when i show them a design um

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,000
uh i want their help like i really have

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,159
no idea what do you like

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
because my head is in the sand right now

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,960
i cannot decide so please

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,679
help me what do you think can work uh

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
and

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,760
say but in the end they really trust me

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
and that's really nice but yeah we talk

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
a lot

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,039
we talk a lot we have a telegram

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,760
conversation and it's full of

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,880
crappy image i just took with my with my

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,279
phone or something

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,640
black and white thing like in pencil

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
what do you think

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,120
and sometimes there's just jokes like oh

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,400
yes i made a gorilla with

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,480
a big butt

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,480
yeah no maybe that's a good idea

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,840
that's good people are nice about it

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,279
that's good cool

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,120
yeah and so about how um how suit

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,039
um how soon before the release do you

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,080
kind of have your final

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,320
design like done

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:37,360
uh i'm always i'm not very good at

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,559
dates and um okay i'm

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,320
not either so often we have

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,039
olive in the community that say

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,559
okay so the release is now we have to we

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,120
need to have something like

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,400
uh what is it like maybe two months

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,880
before

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,559
or one month before something like this

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
i'm sorry i don't know

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,880
i don't know the answer but uh he's

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,679
saying yeah i think we should really

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,799
stop

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,039
uh and start selling things at this date

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,840
but i i think it's a month before but

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,520
i'm not sure

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,760
yeah because i'm trying to think of when

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,960
i pre-ordered this shirt

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,000
but it was just it was like as soon as i

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,760
saw because i knew

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,159
i wanted a shirt to mark my kind of

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,960
first like my first release as a

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,440
canonical

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,720
person and then i saw that when i'm like

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,919
oh my god it's

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,360
so beautiful and

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,440
and so yeah i was just when i got that

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
and what was also cool because i'd been

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
chatting with olive

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,880
in the ubuntu podcast telegram group and

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,840
telegram's great

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
especially since you can chat you can

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
you can do my favorite thing which is

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,760
add

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,320
gifts which is great so i have friends

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,320
that we mostly communicate in gif

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,520
but when i think before the shipping

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,000
started

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,799
i was going to do a heresuit hippo

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,159
release party just on my personal twitch

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,760
and we did some origami and

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:15,679
olive was like can you send me the link

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,399
and so when i got my order there was an

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,360
origami instruction sheet and there's a

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,399
qr code

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,679
for a video so

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,240
i'm going to put the link in the

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,440
because this is a nice easy one i'd

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
heard from

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,000
um elizabeth joseph who used to do um

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,120
ubuntu hours that she had for wiley

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
werewolf

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,760
did a 23

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,840
or 24 step werewolf

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,640
what oh look at that oh my god

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,640
i messed it up i i'm not it was my first

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,279
one so it's not really good but

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,279
it is totally okay more or less

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
there you go so i'm going to put the

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
link for anyone who wants to

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,159
has a square or square-ish piece of

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,240
paper

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
and wants to follow along i'm going to

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,320
put a link in the chat

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,640
because i oh excellent vince's daughter

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,840
is super into origami

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
so yes this is and actually for kids

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,399
it's actually

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,600
it's not too bad um compared to some

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,960
other ones which are

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,880
i was on a website last night and

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,520
there's people who do the 3d

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,840
like origami they're like almost statues

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
and there was a pengolan that took

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,679
somebody

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,960
45 hours to put together

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,840
because they folded every individual

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,000
scale

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
on it was an individual piece of paper

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
and i was like i should send this to

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,200
reese and be like

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,080
hey congrats we're going to fold this

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,799
that's amazing but it was just and but

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
it

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,480
it made me think for events that

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,840
especially since we do

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
the animals this is a great like bit of

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,559
swag

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,840
because then you can you can do you know

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:15,600
like when you're listening to a talk

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,840
you can just be folding the animal there

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,640
and the only thing i wish though is i

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,039
would have gone

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
to michael's and gotten googly eyes to

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,440
put on the

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,120
hippo because with that idea it could be

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,399
something very easy to do events right

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,080
because we could just get some square

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,919
pieces of orange paper and some googly

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,080
eyes yeah

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,480
yes i mean we could like even get it

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,240
printed in like kind of orange and have

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,039
a couple purple

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
and we could even yeah i think it would

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,840
be

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
but i love how you this is so hippo

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,480
colored it's and it matches like

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,480
oh my gosh this matches perfectly i mean

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,799
when olive uh finds a picture of someone

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,159
wearing the hippo shirts are telling oh

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,480
i like it and everything

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,760
he always send me the link so i can be

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,080
happy

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,039
which is really nice but every time you

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,679
say but

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,000
they did not show the origami and she's

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,600
really disappointed

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,360
well i will be sure today

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,279
that i think that the last time i was

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,279
just so happy that i got

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,399
the shirt and i wanted to save the

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,440
origami for

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:30,960
our next for for this

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,720
that i will put another picture

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,240
of me in the shirt with the hippo

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,080
thank you for him thank you you're

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,000
welcome

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,919
yeah so i am so i am really

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,679
so um i know i'm just so happy that we

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,799
could have you on because

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,519
what you guys do is so

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,360
between the events and the merchandise

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,039
and the shirts and just getting the word

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,120
out and i think that

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,799
a lot of people that we kind of tend to

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,880
get caught up in

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:08,360
that contributing means writing code

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,840
or testing or doing something really

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,120
technical

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,600
and i think it's good to remember that

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,039
contributing means spreading the the

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,760
word and getting people

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,399
excited about things and i think you all

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
do that

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,720
just exceedingly well

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,000
yeah so speaking of i think this is a

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,120
good time to mention that you

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,720
guys do this kind of outreach at

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:43,279
music festivals yes

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:47,200
so i know you guys said yes we do

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:53,200
yes totally we start

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,200
joining music event in 2012 i think

00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,799
and it's cool is that what you want

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,320
wanting to know well it's

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:08,159
awesome basically how it works

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,480
so we have a booth in a music festival

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
and you you might say okay it's a music

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,760
festival why

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,720
is there an ubuntu uh booth in a music

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,799
festival

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,159
and that's where we can start talking

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,840
yes we have about

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,240
booze because we want to share

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,760
uh what is a good what is what is ubuntu

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,039
what is a free software

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,360
um if you want you can try here but why

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,399
in

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,240
in a music festival um i

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,519
i often answer because it's too crowdy

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,640
you don't have the 4g to order you

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,600
your co-sharing car to get back home

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
we have internet here get in touch with

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,399
you

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,480
you can try it it's free and we have

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,799
internet

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,120
basically very dishonest but that's how

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,120
it is

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,320
so this is one of the the way to coach

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,919
people

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,640
uh but it it's uh the most

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,000
effective because it's it's working and

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,560
yeah people really can

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
try ubuntu with they don't have to

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,359
believe earth it's easy

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,440
they will find it they will find it out

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,159
we also have a lot of tattoos um

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,000
so people can just come in and say oh i

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,839
want a tattoo it's fun

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,320
and when they put the tattoo they ask

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,679
questions but what is it and we talk

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,159
it's tax or the circle of friend logo

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,079
it means this or that and behind it

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,520
there is a community and ubuntu the

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,200
software and all

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,800
oh so yeah they ask about

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,800
the tattoo after we've done it

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,760
yeah because it's party they're drinking

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,240
they're having fun and

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
they do things after they think yeah

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,839
exactly

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,079
well it's a good thing it's a temporary

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,920
tattoo and not a permanent one

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
though i have a feeling there's probably

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
a lot of people with permanent tattoos

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
who didn't know what they were getting

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,520
before they got

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,599
it so we don't do that we're not

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
good we're dishonest about come for the

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:16,320
internet but

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:19,359
we don't do that you know

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,760
sorry we also have another thing we

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,440
which could bring a lot of people like

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,440
monica

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,079
which is we have a box

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,280
you say hello to the box and it will

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,920
make a gif

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
out of this

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,040
point yes box

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,960
and we we showcased this g

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,240
box at the last book on europe in sintra

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,000
before the bombing oh yeah

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,320
but we have a video if you want to show

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,839
if you want to to see oh what is a

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,920
ubuntu booth in a music festival

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,320
is it very calm and you can't talk to

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,200
people or is it crowdy and

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,160
very noisy i don't know uh i think it's

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,640
better to see

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,839
this in video if you want let me see if

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,839
i can get that up here

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,839
you should be able to speak over it if

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,119
you if you want okay

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,160
so we don't hear but it's really

because that video is from 2016 but it

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
looks like is that something that

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,400
happens every year

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,640
yeah every year since 2012 we go

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,839
in this music festival the name is

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,040
levier

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,359
it's in britain britany it's

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,280
the biggest music festival in france and

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
i think it's the third in europe or

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,440
something like that

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,760
it's about 200 000 visitors

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,200
or maybe it's more than that i don't

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,720
have the numbers but it's

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,720
it's in the same scale

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,240
and yeah every year we have we go in

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
this music festival and we have

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,599
we have internet because we have another

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,599
association in the festival who help

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,520
us to have internet because their job is

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,560
to provide internet

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,000
and so they help us to get in other

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,440
festivals because they're working with

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,160

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,960
way better than mine wow

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,520
this is uh i've been working on these

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,040
for because i practice them a lot before

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,440
the hair suit hippo tea party so

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,839
yes that is okay but i'm definitely

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,280
going to get the

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,240
googly eyes for the next one but yeah

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,760
i'm just thinking

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,400
at whatever get-together we do next

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,200
that we could just have like pickle i

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,160
mean

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,440
there's so many ubuntu animals to to

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,560
choose from

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,520
and just get some cool orange paper

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,720
and who knows maybe we could even get it

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,920
printed like with the

00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,839
like little circles of friends and

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,839
i think for the you to pick unicorn

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
canonicals

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,640
when you can win something it's a

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,640
challenge

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,960
yes a competition i think it was to win

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,200
an

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,680
ubuntu phone yeah i think oh

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,760
and i didn't win i was so sad it was so

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,880
hard the unicorn was so hard to make

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,599
really yeah it was one of those

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,599
like 50 gazillion steps and where you

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,920
just end up crumpling it into a ball of

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,440
paper and throwing it across the room

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,480
i think i can remember the step 10 or 11

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:47,760
always i was broken on this step

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,480
yeah but it's just um but

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,319
speaking of events in the future so when

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,839
you know at some point

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,440
when we're able to have events

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,520
um again

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,359
um kind of what are some of the first

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,640
you know what are the some of

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,800
the things that you all want to do as we

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:14,079
start actually meeting up in person

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,000
so i think it will be too late uh for us

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,280
to register the booth for the music

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,520
festival this summer

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,839
so it might not be this but in october

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,480
i think there is a new release of ubuntu

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,720
um

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,920
that could mean the months after that we

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,280
could have an ubuntu party in paris

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,319
um it could it might be the first event

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,000
um oh by the way uh uh i just wanted to

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,880
mention a

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,440
little thing when you buy a t-shirt you

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,440
might

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,119
you might ask where the money goes and

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,480
one of the example

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,000
is in the booth you saw there is

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,800
a orange on the wall everywhere there is

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,839
a keyboard

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,920
pc and everything all this stuff

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,560
are not buying you get there yeah the

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,520
volunteers did not buy it for the people

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,560
is buy with the money we gather with

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,200
this kind of

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,240
goodies yeah there is a participation

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,280
though

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,359
yeah there are some participation but

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,319
this is the purpose of the the goodies

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,359
is to

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:22,720
to not ask volunteer money to buy

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,720
the hardware stuff which is

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,000
so the next event could be the ubuntu

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,640
party where we

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,520
also use the same pc and keyboard and

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,000
stuff

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,800
and by the way the music festival with

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,440
all the dust and people walking on the

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,480
floor oh yeah you know the the keyboard

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,319
i like

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,800
you can put in the trash every year so

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,839
yeah it's fully it's not really

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,520
eco-friendly but

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:55,280
you know it's it's like that it's really

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,720
uh yeah there would probably be yeah

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,480
saying reese is really into the

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,319
raspberry pie stuff and that might be a

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,680
great thing to bring one of those like

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,079
pie

00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,359
400s too oh that's a good point yeah we

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,160
could bring this point for hundreds with

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,440
zombies

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,200
we could show off we could do some

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,760
little clusters that would be

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,880
pretty cool yeah so we used the

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,960
raspberry pi for the

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:20,640
gif box but we don't use for the desktop

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,720
we use this from one two three

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,359
we use it for some showcase for example

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,359
in the ubuntu party or you become

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,119
but not in music festival because in

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,240
music festival

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,800
what we want is people we maybe spend

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,880
only

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,560
30 seconds on the pc just to download

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,400
the g for something like that

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,640
and we don't want the the tiniest laggy

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,319
thing yeah during this small experiment

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,359
because we don't want people think

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,839
oh it's pc it's laggy

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,480
uh my pc is better i will keep like that

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,160
we want

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
people having the best experience as

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,560
possible that's why we

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,040
we want to have some good pc for now we

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,720
have some

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,240
nuke it's like a pc you dock

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,480
behind your your screen but they are now

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,760
like i think they are more than five

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,200
years old

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,520
and they were not the best uh cpu we

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,319
could get at this time so i think it

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,040
will be soon

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,880
for us to change the this hardware but

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,800
it's not the point of

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,200
now so the next event i think it should

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,319
be

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,359
ubuntu parsi or maybe we do some

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,760
other events in france but in all the

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,480
the in the worldwide ubuntu community we

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,520
do some

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,160
something named the ubuntu hours

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,200
in france we name it uh les paul's

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,800
ubuntu

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,880
ubuntu it's like a it's like a meet-up

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,319

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,520
that time

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,760

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,000
the topic okay the new release or

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,960
there is a new device running about to

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,040
touch i can show you this device or

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
that notice we don't need a topic but we

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,599
just need to get

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:07,119
a picnic or anything

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,760
and we meet and maybe we will be five

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,040
people

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,520
maybe we will be 30 people it doesn't

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,640
matter

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,760
there is another uh event we used to do

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,040
before uh all this uh

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,920
but it was um we didn't it was not

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,040
ubuntu

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,920
it was a gathering of many associations

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,400
in the association many associations

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,079
about

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:35,200
free software and like internet access

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,720
things like this and we

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,400
used to gather at

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,559
the same place where we do the ubuntu

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,760
party every first

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,319
saturday of the month uh and during that

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
time

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,000
uh people could come in and we would we

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,119
would help them

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,040
if they had trouble with uh us we we

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,160
would help them if they had trouble with

00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,839
ubuntu or if they wanted to install an

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,440
ubuntu so it was um like the

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:08,640
install only part of an ubuntu party but

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,119
it was nice also to be a part of uh

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,200
the free software community the french

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,200
free software community as a whole

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,880
during those time it was also pretty

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,640
good i don't know if we can

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,599
do that again after uh yeah is this

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,720
yeah i think it's as soon as the museum

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,760
gives us the

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,119
the green light we will get back there

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,200
and there yeah as a slow side we

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,280
there we can meet some people from the

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,400
fedora community from the debian

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,839
community

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,000
from i don't remember all the distro

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,040
but without there is a lot of other

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,640
distro people

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,319
and there is a workshop area which is

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,480
not for the people

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,240
it well there is an area for people to

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,319
get for the end star party

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,160
there is not another area for people to

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,319
contribute to some project

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,880
and often there is a gathering of people

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,839
from open street paths

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,839
uh

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,559
that's a really great mix so oh

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,960
oh i see you joined us on twitch yep yep

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,760
we

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,400
just yeah that was something that we

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,240
just

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,839
added because we have a lot of

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:29,119
of like streamers who do ubuntu things

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:31,680
on twitch and um especially

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,319
and so if you happen to be somebody who

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,440
streams

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:37,200
ubuntu stuff and we don't know about you

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,200
and because i think that would be a

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,559
great thing to highlight in i don't know

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,079
a blog post or

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,800
something or get people on and this is

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,200
like if you're coding doing artwork if

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,760
you're

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,559
documenting if you're gaming if it

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,119
somehow involves ubuntu let us know

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,880
and so because i know that yannick i

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,359
just um

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,119
convinced him to join twitch and he's

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,880
been very pleased with

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,880
it i also have a friend who i think it's

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,079
a bit early for him

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:12,800
but he is on twitch and he has

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:17,920
his minecraft mark 1 up and going

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:21,319
yes i have one here oh my gosh

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:27,839
uh i think he switched off

00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:27,839
oh there it is

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:38,319
can you sing a song and i had this uh

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
uh poppy voice singing and it won't stop

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,640
and i say

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,319
okay i just plugged it off and i forgot

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,319
to plug in him

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,520
so we poppy he just won't shut up

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,119
sometimes

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,079
it just just keeps going yeah minecraft

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,599
doesn't respect

00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,720
anybody's boundaries it's hilarious

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,119
but it's uh but i sh um i actually

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
should

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,160
um send a link but it's been great to

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,520
see

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,559
like he like updated um

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,760
his minecraft and it's so he's going to

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,480
use it to like

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,359
announce like new streamers and new

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,880
followers

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,599
and things so or anyway that's the plan

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,880
because

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:26,240
trying to get minecraft to say uh

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,480
thank you is impossible because you do

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,040
say thank you and he just goes you're

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,480
wet welcome

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:37,599
it's like he is stubborn

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,800
he is so stubborn but oh but

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,960
he also put on the american

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,559
minecraft voice and we're just like no

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,240
no this voice is wrong

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,880
make this stop but no but

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,920
that would be uh so i'm kind of jealous

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
of all of you with the

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,640

exciting thing

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,720
first first time we got together to eat

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,119

that but the biggest part the defense

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,720
my preferred part is the social event

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,599
uh it's of the event you have a lot of

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,000
things that

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
just eat together in the restaurant but

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,119
with the year

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:16,480
and the years the book and europe

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,359

there are maybe not a lot of mortal but

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,400

awful lot of people who are inside

00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,880
