uh my name

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,719
is rhys davis i am a developer advocate

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,079
at canonical and today we'll be talking

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
about raspberry pi

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
and we'll be talking to a couple of the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,480
engineers behind the ubuntu support

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
for raspberry pi uh so this should be

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
hopefully it'll be a little bit

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,640
interesting a little bit

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
uh exciting we'll talk about the past

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
the present and some of the plans we

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
have for the future

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
uh before we get into all of that stuff

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
um i'll let

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,440
the the gentlemen here introduce

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,760
themselves uh dave do you want to start

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,760
sure uh hi i'm dave jones uh also known

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
as waveform80 on twitter and uh

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
waveform on various places like freenode

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
and libero nowadays

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
uh i'm the engineer responsible for

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
ubuntu on the pi

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
at the pi foundation uh not the pi

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,000
foundation the ubuntu foundations team

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
pretty confusing these things um so i

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,320
undergo that

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
coordinates what we try and get into

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,320
which release

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
um and try and uh prioritize the bug

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,759
fixes that we

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
would make for each release i've been on

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,799
that uh my first release

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,000
was disco um i think i came on about a

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,759
month before disco so i didn't

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
do much on it other than watch and stare

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,479
and go oh this is how things work

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
but i've been there since um through

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,759
focal groovy

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,920
suits and so on i'll be there for a push

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
too

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
uh william wilson um john smith just

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
about everywhere else

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
you know free node twitter all the

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
things

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
i'm the new kid on the block pie wise or

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
really ubuntu wise uh

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,840
it came on at the very beginning of the

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,160
year so pursuit hippo was my first

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,679
release

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
looking forward to my first long-term

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
support release which will be whatever

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,959
jj

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,680
is yeah so i live in dallas

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,040
i grew up in philly and i just always

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
been obsessed with raspberry pies and

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
now i get to work with them which is

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
really exciting which is pretty great

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,800
cool and you both are on the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
uh foundations team which i didn't

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
mention that but maybe

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
so there's no confusion between

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
raspberry pi foundation and foundations

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
like dave's confusion

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
uh maybe you wanna well william can you

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
define can you tell everyone what the

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
foundation team is and what you guys

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
sure uh so there are a whole bunch of

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,440
different types of ubuntu there's the

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,280
server edition

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,040
there's the uh desktop edition uh and we

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,040
at the foundations team we try to handle

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,000
things that are common between those

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,840
different types

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
uh so things like networking we handle

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
things like the boot process we handle

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,040
uh big exception there is we don't do

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
the kernel

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
but yeah we just try to basically as the

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
name implies we

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,000
are the foundations for all the

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,360
different different types of ubuntu

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
is that a good enough explanation dave

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
considering how many years like six

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
months

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,959
that is pretty much what foundations do

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
i should probably also mention uh prior

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
to ubuntu i've been involved in various

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,159
pi libraries so if anybody

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
knows pi camera and pi sense and pi

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,000
craft and can you spot a theme yet

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,239
um uh i've had a

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
small hand in things like gpio0 and pie

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,440
mills and that sort of thing

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,280
and i still do yeah i mean

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,640
foundation steam is exactly what william

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,560
described probably better than i could

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
cool and so we'll be talking about i'll

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
be talking about orthix pie in the

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,159
future the past

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
present and the future and all these

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
kind of things uh before just before

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,720
just quickly before that i see there's

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
there's a comment from ben already when

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
is cheap

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,640
cheap gpio02 coming out

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,280
do you not know ben it's your project

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,239
okay okay um so the first thing we want

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
to talk about was

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,439
uh sort of the history of ubuntu on the

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
raspberry pi so i'll give a little bit

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
of

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,319
a little bit of background a little bit

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
of context and i'll hand over to dave

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
because

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,440
you've been here longer than i have um

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,199
oh but actually before i do that i just

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,239
want to qualify this with we've all got

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
our ubuntu

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
community hats on here we're not wearing

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,440
our canonically hats so everything we

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
say here is

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
as bunty community member and

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,639
contributing to

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,560
not uh so um

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
everything we say isn't necessarily what

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
canonical is saying what canonicals are

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
doing but

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
it's just our opinions and what we think

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
about raspberry pi because we're all

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
the three of us are very very uh a pie

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
guys

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
right so let me go uh let me say a

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
little bit of background

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
so ubuntu uh has been uh

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
has had some form of raspberry pi

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
support for a long time

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
uh there's been you've been you've been

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
able to get it working or you've been

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
able to do some things with it for a

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,240
long time

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,039
but about uh but a couple of years ago

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
uh is when

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,080
thing we started getting a little bit

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
more serious about it before then it was

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
it was very similar to anything any

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,240
other sort of cloud type

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
thing that have been do random um and

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
then

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
with which release was it they which was

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
it that we came in

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
so i came in on the disco release prior

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
to that i think we've had

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
ubuntu releases going as far back as

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
xenial on the pie

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
so there was a 1604 but i've never had

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
anything to do with those all for that

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
matter

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,759
um anything up to bionic so bionics

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,479
the earliest um release that i've ever

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,440
touched anything on

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,639
as far as ubuntu won the pi sport went

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
before that

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
it was treated very much like any other

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
um cloud platform or

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
much like any other single board

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
computer in as much as a release

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,000
was made by taking an existing

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
cloud image with a standard cloud bases

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
and tweaking

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,479
the bootloader so that it would boot up

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
and that was about it

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,759
not much else in terms of customization

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,319
but

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
the pie is in many many ways a special

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,720
snowflake

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
and does require quite a lot of

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
customization

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
and it's worth the customization as well

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
given the size of the community around

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
it

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,199
so i think by the time disco rolled

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
around

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
they realized that they needed some

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,000
dedicated head count to

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
that particular platform and i was

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
working on

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
the landscape team at the time and was

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,319
dropped into

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
the foundations team to say you know

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,680
about buy stuff don't you

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,880
you can do this as i said i think about

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,840
releasing stuff but hey okay

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,479
i'll give it a crack and um and yeah as

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,080
i say disco came out shortly afterwards

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
uh i didn't have much to do with the

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
discover release other than watching

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
other people

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
and going ooh uh i had a bit more to do

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
in the oven release

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
and then focal was the first release

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
that i did a serious amount of work on

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,319
though i still on focal we didn't do a

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
huge amount

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
um that was risky for the simple reason

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
that it was an lts release

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
we wanted to make sure that that was

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
something that could reliably be

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,319
supported for 10 years

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
the whole point of of releasing pi

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
specific images

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,520
was giving them exactly the same sport

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,840
cycle as the regular pc images

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
so you've got the same old free

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
five-year support

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,199
on the lts releases with the option of

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,360
five years extension

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
paid on esm and so on but that means

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,880
that whatever we put in we have to be

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
prepared to support for 10 years

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,639
which is which is a while

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
um so that's a long time aside from

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
aside from the work that you've done

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
um at chronicle for the for the for

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
boomerang raspberry pi

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
what were you doing uh pie wise maybe

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
before canonical before the last bad

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,240
thing

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,520
or sort of otherwise spare time-wise

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
community

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
um so then we'll know about it i know

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
you've got a long list yeah

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
yeah ben will know all of this because

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
ben is responsible for roping me in to

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,800
much of this

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
i could reliably point the finger at him

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
um around about

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,080
i think it must have been 2013 or so i

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,280
was fascinated by this new

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,319
pi device that had come out and a

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
friend of mine who i knew from the

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
python northwest group the young ben

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
nettle who is

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,639
on the comments over there um sent me i

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,319
think uh

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,720
one of the camera modules that has just

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,759
come out and i looked anyway oh this is

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
kind of funky

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
but there's no python library there's

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,800
probably a right one

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,960
so i wrote one and released it not

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
really thinking anything more about it

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
i've written a few open source things

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,399
before then but they were largely

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,399
yes just pointing the finger at them

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
but most of the open source i've done

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,200
before then was largely ignored

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
pie camera wasn't ignored and was sort

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
of experiencing a thousand plus

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,760
downloads a month and i was going oh

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
i've got to support this now

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,720
it's grown quite a bit since then and

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,760
we've done a lot of work on it

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
um ben was instrumental in helping an

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,839
awful lot with access to some of the

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
firmware dev's at the pie foundation

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,320
where he wound up working

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
um and that helped a great deal in

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
figuring out

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
how things operated at the low level

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
with the camera

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
and then men started another project

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,080
called gpio0 and

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
i went oh i've got some ideas for that

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
and he brought me into doing large

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
amounts on that

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,360
and then he started the pie wheels

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,360
project and broke me into that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,240
i shouldn't say no but it's too much fun

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,680
yes there are many many projects for

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
which i could point the blame

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,920
but we'll see the point of vietnam but

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,760
everyone else could point some blame at

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
you so that's good that's good that is

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,720
there's something going on right

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,200
um cool and uh wait do you wanna

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,080
uh well what what about you when you

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
joined you said

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,160
a few six months ago in january i think

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
it was uh what have you done since then

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
and

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,279
uh and what have you done uh outside of

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,560
chronological outside of ubuntu stuff

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,480
with the raspberry pi

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
so for the pursuit hippo release i

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
helped out a lot well

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,360
i helped out a little as much as uh as

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
much as i could

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
with the gpio support and then a little

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
bit of hardware enablement for some of

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,640
the newer models like the pi 400

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
the gpio work was a ton of fun

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
just digging into that code and you know

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
i've used gpios a million times and so

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
being able to to contribute to it was

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,360
was really fun

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,320
um outside of work i've had

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,600
pies all over my house doing a variety

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,079
of things for years and years

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
my security cameras are raspberry pi's

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,760
uh which

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
all the code for that is up on github uh

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
which

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,480
is one of the very few places i'm not

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,920
john smith i am glenn pickle which is

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,399
a very obscure reference to a us tv show

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,000
called the office

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,160
which i know there's a british version i

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
know

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,920
we don't give away that much either so

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
yeah my security cameras which

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,200
is a system of three pies two of them

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
are the actual cameras and then one is a

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
network video recorder so all the

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,720
files get dropped there in case of any

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,160
tampering or anything like that

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,519
my home router is a raspberry pi it's a

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,000
54 with a usb 3

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,640
ethernet adapter for the interface from

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
the

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,440
modem itself and then the

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,839
poe hat with the switch that goes and

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,000
runs dhcp services and gets me to the

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,000
internet

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
so all of this traffic is currently

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
traveling through a raspberry pi at

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,040
least one

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,040
now i feel another project coming off

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
well i can't claim the same and now i'm

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,560
jealous

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,560
wait do you have a on raspberry

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,279
pies but that is that's surprising

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,279
but not the router

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
yeah i'd be happy to share configs code

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
all that stuff

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,880
um other than that yeah i'm hosting um

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
some websites

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
some proximity chat for among us on

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
raspberry pi's they're just

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,880
there's a whole little cluster of them

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
that i'm trying to tame all the wiring

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,480
for

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,480
in my living room

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
nice nice okay cool um and i'll just

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,959
i'll say a

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
quick thing about about me so i don't

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
seem like a complete

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
no-nothing next to you guys but um i've

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
i've been

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,800
i've just been playing with red surprise

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
and tinkering around surprise for a long

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320
time as well

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,000
throughout university um i was building

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
little contraptions and little robots

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
and things

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,560
um just for for fun and for my course

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
because i was

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
mechatronic engineering be trained and

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
then since then

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,320
i've put to some similar type things

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,079
i've got some a just the camera a bit

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
not their network but i might i need to

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,480
poke around your your github there

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,639
william to pick up on some of that stuff

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,160
um but otherwise it's just just sort of

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
things that sit behind the tv and

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
collect things

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
media servers and next clouds and those

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,839
kinds of things but all of that

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,120
is is uh outside of chronicle stuff with

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
canonical i

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
i've been around since eowyn and i've

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,160
been working on pie stuff since

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,200
uh sometime into 2020 when we started

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
talking to

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
uh the raspberry pi foundation and

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
working with them a little bit more

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
closely and

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,920
and having regular meetings and talking

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,720
about these things which is

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,399
uh where the ubuntu desktop uh came out

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
of came out of that collaboration for

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
four raspberry pi which came with groovy

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,279
which is actually what i've got on my

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
shirt here i'm just gonna

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,639
put that up there there we go how come

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,959
you've got it i haven't got it's not

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,480
it's not an official shirt uh i can't

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,959
claim that it is those shirts don't

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
exist

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
yet or maybe they would at all it's

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,320
custom-made don't at me

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,320
um but it's but yeah it was it was

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
one of my with my proudest releases so i

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
thought i thought i'd put it on the

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
shirt

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
um cool okay so that's a little bit of

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
history

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,839
about what we've been doing and a bit

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
about ubuntu on raspberry pi

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
i'll just uh re-mention here because

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
since there's some

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
new people in the chat if you have any

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
questions or any comments please feel

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
free to

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
to put them in either twitch or youtube

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
we'll see both conversations coming from

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,600
youtube or from twitch

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,120
um but if you can please head over to

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
twitch to chat to each other because

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
that's where

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,199
you'll be able to see most people

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
talking but if you have any questions

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,040
we'll we'll see them and we'll uh we'll

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,199
answer them

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,800
uh as they come and go 99 dollars for

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,320
your t-shirt no deal

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,079
yeah no deal no dude

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,440
um okay so let's talk a little so next

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,880
we want to talk about a little bit about

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
right here right now because this is the

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,519
stuff that's going on so

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
a month or so ago now was the we

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,839
announced sort of

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,399
support for the uh gpio on the resupply

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
i was hoping uh william you mentioned it

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
a little bit

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
so maybe you can start uh start talking

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
about what the work that went into

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
that and what that means right now for

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,279
the state of things

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,360
yeah sure um so with the new kernel um

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
the way that the gpios are accessed is a

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,880
little bit different uh dave can speak

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,079
to the details on that a little bit

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,199
better than i can even though he's

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,000
explained it to me like

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,120
four times at least he's still the

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
expert there

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
um but essentially the the old way of

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
doing things was

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,519
very hacky and bit bangy and we're

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
trying to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
gradually improve it and move on to

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
ways that play a little bit nicer with

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,560
the kernel so there's

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,800
a package called lgpio which

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:28,800
enables usage of pwm i squared c

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,759
basic gpio high low spi

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,440
maybe some other things that i'm

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
forgetting but it's really nice library

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
it does

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,680
does things very pretty so i actually

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,120
made a bunch of examples of different

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
scripts and stuff to use all those

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,320
different

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
protocols i'm working on a project

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
myself at the moment

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
which is an ugly mess of wires yes but

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
it will be

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,959
uh these fans will

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
go in my new raspberry pi stack that i'm

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
making

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
and try to keep everything cool it's a

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
little thermometer attached to it and

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
then

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,040
the pwm fan which is just a knock to a

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
fan

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
uh will be controlled through lgp ios

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,279
pwm

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,880
modules using the hardware pwm

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,000
actually that's not always better than

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,780
the software plan but still you're right

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,040
which is why i flinched as i said

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,399
[Laughter]

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,240
someone in the chat didn't call you out

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
there dave on the street

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,000
that's good to talk a little bit about

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
the gpio stuff as well sure

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
things as william says um things have

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
changed a lot uh

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,120
there are a lot of changes coming with

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,240
the gpio historically

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,720
um gpio has been handled by

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,079
banging on the gpi registers straight

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
from user space

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,839
with whatever language you like

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
bypassing the kernel entirely i mean

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
traditionally the idea of having your

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,920
kernel

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
is your kernel deals with the hardware

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
and you talk to the kernel to say i

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,639
would like to do this with the hardware

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,639
and the girl says yay or nay and

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,079
mediates all the access and

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,680
handles people stepping on each other's

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,680
toes and so on

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,880
but the kernel interfaces for gpio were

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,079
shall we say insufficient um round about

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,839
the time the pie was released

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,439
they were pretty basic and they didn't

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,720
include facilities for things like

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,039
pull-ups and pull-downs

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
which are hugely useful uh if you're

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,360
fiddling around with things on a

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
breadboard and you want to connect a

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,120
button straight to your gpio

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,959
so without those things the designers um

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,160
but the authors of various libraries

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
decided the only

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,520
realistic way to deal with this and to

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,280
deal with it quickly enough

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,120
was to just bang on the registers so

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
they just go to deaf members root

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,559
and bang away the gpio registers in

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679
memory

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,799
which works sort of um it's not what

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
you're meant to do

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,400
with things but you need to master the

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,520
devil drives and

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,160
they did uh and that worked for

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,679
most things it didn't work for event

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
handling because the kernel

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,559
absolutely wants to control those

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
registers and as soon as you start

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,120
stepping on them

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,640
as we discovered with the native driver

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
in gpio zero

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
things crash but that's okay as you wind

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
up with uh this sort of slightly

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,760
schizophrenic routine of

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
doing the right thing going via the

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
kernel for event handling and doing the

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,679
wrong thing for

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,679
everything else and that has worked and

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,360
is still working to this day

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,679
with most of the libraries out there so

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
that's the way that our paigeekio and

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,559
pyupio and wiringpi and all the rest

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
this is how they still work

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
right les has asked an excellent

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,679
question in the chat rpgpo is indeed

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,640
the default means of accessing the gpl

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,200
and the raspberry pi lgpio is not a

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
direct drop-in there are several reasons

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,840
for this lg power

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,240
is written by the same author as pi gpio

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,679
and is the sort of spiritual successor

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
to it in a way

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
in that it plays with this new kernel

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,799
interface that

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,320
provides all the facilities that we do

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200
want including pull-ups and pull-downs

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
and so on

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
for handling gpio because of that it

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
follows the pi gpio style rather than

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,960
the lg pio style

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
and that is a bit of a problem for

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,600
anybody that's currently using rpi gpio

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,559
for those i don't have a good answer

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,039
other than

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,320
find another library because r by gpio

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
is

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
not there have been a couple of attempts

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
to make a

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,320
uh gpo chip based version of arpai gpio

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,280
but none that work well that i've seen

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,080
yet

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,960
gpio0 users plug

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,160
nothing to do gpio0 users shouldn't

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,960
notice any difference

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,400
for the simple reason that gpr0 doesn't

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
do any driving of the pins itself it

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
sits on top of all the libraries

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,080
and historically it's always sat on top

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
of r by gpio by default but can sit on

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
pi gpio or

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,760
a couple of other ones including a

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,440
native driver for ubuntu pursuit because

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
we knew this kernel change was coming

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,679
this doesn't affect us by us

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,200
yet but for ubuntu issue we knew that

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,240
the kernel changes were coming

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,600
so we packaged up lgpo

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,840
and then added a module for gpio0 to sit

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,320
on top of lgpi by default

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
so if you use gpio0 on her suit you

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,320
should be going through

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,520
lgpio by default your script should

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,640
still work because it's still just

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,159
gpi zero at the end of the day and

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,320
hopefully you won't notice any

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,320
differences please

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,679
um but do test it do let us know if

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,240
there are any problems

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,120
because it should work and we would very

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
much like to know

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
about these problems because these

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,039
changes will be coming to ra's pass

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,799
in the next release uh raspberries will

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,240
be moving to a later kernel version

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,159
they will have to make certain changes

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
as well um so

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,360
it's very important to um to check that

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,480
these things

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,320
do work now before they affect

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,320
everything that you're doing

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
the uh the follow-up that liz had there

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
is sort of relevant to the next thing

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,159
that's going to ask which is what you

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
guys are sort of working on now with the

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
next

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,320
right thing that'll come out the thing

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,559
that'll happen will be because

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,840
uh he asked because it is a factor in

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
being able to use hats

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
add-ons with ubuntu on their surprise so

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
maybe dave do you want to go over that

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
what's

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,559
what's next on the list big push with uh

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
focal was basically to get something and

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,400
basically get the boot sequence sorted

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,320
out the big push was groovy vocal

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,679
that was with focal then with groovy the

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,960
big push was to get all the stuff

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,720
on the pi working and most of that

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
happened except for gpio which was

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
super complicated in that push to his

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,400
suit so with a suit we have

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,559
pretty much everything on the pie itself

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
working so now the push and impish is to

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,360
get

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
hats working at the moment we are

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,520
lacking an

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
awful lot of the hat libraries um that

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,520
raspberries have

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,720
so most of the primer only libraries

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,720
for um sort of thing one let's talk

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,880
ahead now explore hack for example

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,760
where there is a python library for that

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
on raspberry

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,919
we don't yet have that on ubuntu so to

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,440
push this cycle is to get as many of

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,240
these things as possible

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
up to debian if i can um which in which

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,120
case it'll

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,080
filter back down to raz pass and ubuntu

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,080
we're both downstream from debian

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,960
and failing that if that can't be done

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,080
then get them straight over to ubuntu

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,679
where possible uh so the big push this

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
cycle is indeed to get hats working

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
and that will mean that if any of this

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,240
comes up with

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,080
um having rpi gpro as an interface there

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,400
we'll have to apply local patches to

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
shift that over to lgbio

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,600
those patches will be sent upstream um

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,000
hopefully they will be acceptable

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,799
uh we'll have to see what happens with

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,799
that but yes

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,559
the big push this cycle is to get hats

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,039
working because that's an area where

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
we're lacking

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
well so you what hats are you shooting

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,000
for first i know we're shooting for the

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,200
sense that first because of popularity

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
and so on yeah what

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
would you want to see what would you

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,480
want specifically the center is the

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,679
biggie for me because it's the one i use

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,320
most i mean i i have a sensor

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,600
sat on my oh he says trying to pull it

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
off the cable here

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
so i have a little sensor that sits on

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,840
my desk and that is the polywheels

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,240
monitor that tells me the status of all

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,159
the

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
nodes in the pi walls cluster and yes

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
it's running on a battery

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,520
and it allows me to do funky little

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,360
things like investigate what

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,559
the various nodes are all up to

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
changes you probably can't see the

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
colors or anything like that on this but

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
yeah

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
that is very very useful for for

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
monitoring things sits in the corner of

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,600
my desk

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,480
if everything turns red on there i go i

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,640
better go and fix my wheels quickly

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,120
yeah other than that

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,039
there are several primary hats which i

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,640
know are quite widely used in education

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
explorer hats probably the biggest one

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
there

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
uh there's a few motor driver hats that

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,559
will be very useful for robotics

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,840
projects that i'd like to try and get in

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,960
um there's some of the older

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,480
uh adc hats um

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,320
i forget that i'm blanking on the name

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,039
of them now but um yeah

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
there's a few of the hats with mcp 308s

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
and

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,640
another adcs on that would be very nice

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,279
to get in uh most of those relatively

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,799
relatively simple i think uh as less

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,919
pointed out there are some rpa gpio

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,080
issues there but the ones

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,520
like the adc's they're run over sbi so

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,760
no particular issue there

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,360
um sbi is trivial to get working uh

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,679
along with last quarter

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
um but gpr stuff yeah um analog zero

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,159
there you go then

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,559
this is reminded me though

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
so yeah there you go cool what about you

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
what uh

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,880
perhaps would you would you want to see

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,200
happen next that we can maybe start

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
ferrying people that uh definitely the

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
sunset which is already

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
prioritized i've got i've got a pipe

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
dream project i'd like to

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,640
see if i can get working with the sense

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,919
hat which is uh

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
along with a whole bunch of other

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,000
sensors i'm sure and this is a idea i

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,600
had on vacation last week so it's very

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
poorly thought out so far

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
uh is a raspberry pi controlled 3d

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,400
printable

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,919
drone with a pie camera on it

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,679
cool dave looks skeptical go on

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:55,440
yes yes um i like it it can be done

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,440
uh latency is interesting

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,440
there are ways around that but yeah uh

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,039
i've got a bunch of the pymaroni hats so

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
that's definitely a priority for me as

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,080
well

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,840
awesome cool cool unicorns i'm just

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,760
gonna be unicorns somebody's asked an

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
interesting question about ubuntu on the

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,240
2gig model

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,600
with a poly4 2gig bottle uh

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
and then asked whether the desktop can

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,720
run on it and somebody just tried

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,400
the desktop won't work it can work with

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,080
a little tinkering

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
don't expect great things for it but yes

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,559
i did a blog post in

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,559
last month on uh playing around with the

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,919
ubuntu pursuit desktop for a while

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,919
and using uh zedswap on it and with

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
a decent zed swap setup you can actually

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,720
launch quite a few things even on the

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,760
2gig

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,480
it's not bad interesting although it's

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
probably worth

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
uh what was saying as well though that

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,880
while i would do desktop doesn't work on

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,000
the two gigabytes i've been doing a

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
server and a video call will work

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,919
the desktop isn't officially supported

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,279
on the 2gig but it will work and with a

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,520
little tinkering you can actually make a

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,039
quite decent experience out of it

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,400
nice nice okay that's good um before

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,799
as there's another question that i've

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,240
seen in there that that was going to be

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,520
relevant a bit later so i'll skip over

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,120
martin's question for now but we'll talk

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,240
about that in a bit

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
um uh so um

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
yeah okay cool so that's what that's

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
what's going to happen now that's what

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,000
we'd like to see happen

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,080
um and i i guess actually now we can

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,400
just talk about that so

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
something that i want to push as a

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,440
community team person

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,679
and something that i'm trying to push

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,360
across uh canonical but also

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,120
just generally was in the communities

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,120
people doing things people

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
taking some initiative and not asking

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,679
for permission not waiting for things to

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,320
happen just doing things if they want to

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,760
do them

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,159
in support of ubuntu support of these

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,240
things and one of the things

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
because of the pi community is so large

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,200
and the ability community

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
is a lot of technical people and

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,760
tinkerers in there i'd really

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,960
like to see more people doing whereas

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
things on raspberry pi because of course

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
i would

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,200
um but the one of the barriers to that

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,640
right now is how

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
how people could get involved and how

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,919
people can can do these things for

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,039
themselves and how people can contribute

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,720
to these things

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,480
now we i can tell you that we're working

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,240
on uh sort of

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,240
an on-boarding process a way for people

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,120
to very easily do these things

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
but right now uh dave i was wondering if

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,000
you would be able to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,520
point people to places and talk a little

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,919
bit how about how you

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,720
and and william would like to have

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,120
people um

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,880
helping out or contributing these things

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
right now the biggest thing is testing

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,760
testing testing

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,000
um using it as much as you can in as

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,799
many different configurations as you can

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,159
so one of the the big changes that we've

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,399
had in the last couple of releases was

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,399
moving away from u-boot

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,919
if you're using focal it's still using

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,840
your boot by default because

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,840
long-term service and we don't want to

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,279
go messing with people's boot configs

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,600
on something that has to be supported

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,480
for that long but groovy was the first

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,159
one we released

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,080
that doesn't have you boot on there by

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,080
default if you installed from scratch if

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,200
you upgrade from focal to groovy

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,200
it will keep your u-boot intact um

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
you can remove it fairly trivially i

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,760
need to run a proper blog post together

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,440
i wrote a

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,640
hacky one a while back and it's it's not

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
great but i need to write a better one

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,279
about that

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,480
um for impish we hope

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,720
i hope to strip out you

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
forcibly if it is still there so for

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,679
people who have upgraded focal degree to

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,159
suits to impish

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,760
you will be removed from the config if

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,559
it's still there

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,679
um anyway the the reason i mention all

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
this

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,200
is that yubi was the primary thing

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,480
standing in the way of getting

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,279
usb boot working you has

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
usb drivers for the pi's usb ports but

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,399
they didn't seem to work terribly well

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
with the nice storage devices and it

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
took

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,880
quite a long time for the usb 3 port to

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,360
get supported on new boot

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,799
anyway no problem uh with groovy onwards

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
because new bridge isn't in the blue

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,640
sequence

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,159
so we can do usb boot and indeed

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,080
theoretically at least netboot in

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,159
exactly the same way as raspberries does

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,159
so if you're happy doing those things on

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,799
raspberries please go and try them on

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,320
ubuntu

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,480
let us know if you have any problems

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
with that um particularly

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,240
different types of calories different

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,640
types of drives very recently

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,399
nvme drives have been supported for boot

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,080
on the compute module 4.

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,640
theoretically that is all supported on

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,880
ubuntu on her suit i think

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,960
i'm pretty sure focal doesn't have the

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,320
back pulse of the firmware there yet

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
but that's something i need to add

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,440
before focus point 3 release

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,640
so that can be supported there as well

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,919
so yeah

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
testing testing testing on as many

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,880
different devices and boot devices as

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,799
possible

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,240
there's probably not much point in

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
testing hats

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,320
yet until we start getting some of those

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,440
packages either upstream or into ubuntu

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
itself this cycle

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,880
but that would mean using the

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,600
development release which

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,200
if you're happy doing that great love to

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,120
hear about testing on that but

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,039
i know most people are not terribly

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,520
happy using development devices so

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,159
please go and try out gpio stuff on her

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,159
suit

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,520
we would love to know if the new gpio

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,799
layers work

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,360
um if they don't appropriate places to

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,640
file

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
bugs launch pad under the lgpio project

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,039
if you're testing

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,279
gpio or the gpio0 project again

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,880
on launchpad because this would be

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,760
ubuntu specific

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
best to report it on launchpad before we

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,960
figure out whether or not it's an

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,159
upstream issue or not

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,120
um for boot things uh

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,360
probably best to file bugs against flash

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,000
kernel on launchpad i think that's

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,640
usually uh a particular culprit because

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
that's

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,399
responsible for writing all the stuff to

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,919
the group partition so any boot bugs

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,360
should probably go into flash kernel on

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,240
launchpad

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,360
and other than that um yeah testing

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,559
testing

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,039
whatever packages you can everything you

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,679
can any hardware you can

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,200
say that's not necessarily worthwhile

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,960
yet

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
come coming up to this we want i wanted

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,840
to put together some kind of

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,120
documentation for how people can do this

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,799
uh which we didn't which we didn't get

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,600
around to finishing but in the next

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,360
couple of weeks

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,039
i'll uh we'll put out a blog post and

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,360
some documentation somewhere

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,960
as to one how you can do this testing

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,760
how you can do these bugs

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,200
uh and two um everything that they've

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,240
just said in one place so you can you

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
can look and see what's going on and

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
then we'll stop bringing that and

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,120
hopefully get some

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,240
people around it the um specific

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,840
question that you might have answered

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,039
and i didn't uh pick up that this was an

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,960
answer that question that dave the

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,480
specific question that martin had was is

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
there any way that community people can

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,600
help

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,360
prepare prepare module packages for

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,159
inclusion debian and or ubuntu

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
before then yes if there are packages

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,120
existing in rail's payoffs one of the

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,279
things i'm currently going through

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,559
is making sure that they are debian

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
ready um

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,320
debian tends to be considerably stricter

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,200
than raz pass about

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,720
things like the copyright files and

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
making sure that all the debian

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,480
packaging

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,159
is up to the latest standards the latest

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,440
uh dev helper compatibility levels and

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
all that sort of thing if you're

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,559
familiar with debian packaging

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,960
please feel free to pick a hat

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,240
package that you happen to have that you

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,440
can work on

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,960
and see if you can work on it

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,000
to get it up to debian standards for

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
upstream that be fantastic

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,519
other than that if you know that there

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,360
are packages that

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,960
have pip packages for example but not

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,399
necessarily dead packages it would be

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,799
great to see if we can

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,919
debianize some of those as well there's

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,519
quite a few of those

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,679
and those might be a little trickier

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,080
especially if they pull in third-party

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,200
dependencies

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,679
again it's not terribly difficult to do

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
this

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,279
simply but to do it to the standard that

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
debian is going to require to go

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,720
upstream is

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,200
is a rather harder prospect but yep well

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,080
worth

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,799
well worth doing um somebody's asked

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
where they can

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,240
get the impush daily images if you go to

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,080
well actually i'll see if i can a couple

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,960
of urls pasted in here

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,960
i'll paste

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
for anyone who's watching this not live

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
uh hopefully by the time that you are

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,720
watching this i love i'll i'll go

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,000
through back to this video and include

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,360
as many links as i can

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
so the things that dave's about to put

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,399
in the chat which if you might

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,320
if you can't find it it should be in the

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,240
description um

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,640
in the doobly-doo below so you'll just

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,640
be able to click on that instead

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,480
um the other thing so that's that's

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
that's testing that's packages

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,080
and of course there's documentation and

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,279
there's other things as well

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,159
and yeah i'll i'll do a maybe it might

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,640
be a wiki page

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,000
i'm not a i'm not a huge fan of the the

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
wiki as it stands at the moment there's

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
some things that we need to improve but

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,080
it'll either be a wiki page it'll be a

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,519
discourse post

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,120
and it'll be a couple of blog posts to

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,279
sort of have all the all of the

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
information in one place

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,640
um and then we'll turn it into some some

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,159
kind of official documentation down the

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,760
road because we're working on

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,760
on that sort of ecosystem and trying to

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,760
put all that stuff in one place

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,159
um the other thing that people can do of

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,720
course is start thinking more about

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,519
um enabling their apps and developing

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
apps on ah

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,039
itself because there's a lot of there's

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,399
a lot of problems in general around how

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,360
a lot of the mainstream maps a lot of

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
apps

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,880
just don't have very good arm support

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,240
right um whether that's

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,240
whatever packaging that is whether

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,919
that's snaps or not it's uh it's a bit

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
of a it's an issue at the moment on the

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,760
on

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,280
raspberry pi platforms and going into

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,800
the future when there's

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,639
uh when there's going to be more arm

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
hardware more arm desktops and so on

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,320
the app ecosystem is a lot smaller than

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
it is on

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,839
on i guess typical desktop environments

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
so it would be a really good way to

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,000
contribute in general

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,679
is to help port or to develop your apps

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,760
apps in the beginning with proper arm

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,040
support and then if you tell us about

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,079
any of these things if you talk to us

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,599
about any of these things we'll include

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
them in videos we'll promote those to

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,760
the ability social channels and all this

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,040
kind of thing

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,200
because i think it's really important

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,159
that we get um we get people enabled on

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,399
the raspberry pi

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,839
if you will did you get that link there

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,639
dude

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,919
um yeah we've got uh the impresser

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,399
dailies

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,599
link up there the desktop dailies link

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,119
should be along shortly

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,880
just to address a couple of other

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,200
comments that have come up um

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,560
somebody's asked about fixing video

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,040
tearing and

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,640
video acceleration we do have video

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,680
acceleration

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,359
on the desktop since groovy and her suit

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,520
obviously is on the weyland desktop now

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,400
and that also has acceleration

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,520
whether or not it's do not expect the

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,440
acceleration to be

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,640
better or for that matter worse than raz

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,520
pass

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,320
both teams um we have regular meetings

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,200
now with the

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,320
with the pi foundation team who work on

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,200
the graphic stack

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,079
and we have a guy who also works on

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,839
mutter

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,119
which is part of the weyland desktop

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,839
stack

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,880
and they're now each working on various

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,920
different components

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,720
but i wouldn't expect us to be any

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,760
further ahead

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,280
than raspberries other than on the basis

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
of the release schedule being a little

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,960
more common on ubuntu

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:59,040
but both of us are both sides of this

00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:01,359
are working on towards the same goal

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,119
yeah uh there was a follow-up from

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,200
martin of um

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,960
if he put packages in a ppa to a good

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
standard is there a project on debbie

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,280
and

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,119
salsa to submit them uh yes the debian

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
python project assuming their python

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,240
packages

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,920
um the vast majority of how packages i'm

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,599
aware of are generally python packages

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,440
but yes debian python

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,640
um i've recently applied up there and i

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,960
should be able to

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,200
help massage things along

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,280
another question that i can probably

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,760
just answer

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,640
um yes why was youboot included with

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,800
vocal

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,520
largely because of the difficulty in

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,599
migrating people away from it

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,599
we've got to deal with is not just a

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,880
question of new images

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,720
um but what do you do with people

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
upgrading as i say for people upgrading

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
from focal to groovy they're still

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
sticking with you

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,880
for now because excising a fairly large

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
chunk of

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
people's boot configuration which is

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,079
user editable and frequently edited on

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,119
the pi

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,480
is a non-trivial thing um

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,240
that is something that i am hoping to

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,599
address for ambition i've got a few

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
reasonable ideas for how to do that

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,440
using pi boot control

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,440
but yes that is largely the reason

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,520
cool good um and then of course the

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
other

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,480
way people can get involved and help and

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
so on is starting these kind of

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,839
discussions

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,880
over on discourse and dave and i and

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,560
william here can all

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
can all jump in and discuss and if you

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,760
have any ideas we can help you and

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,079
and so on and so forth um

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,960
cool great well we've been doing a

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,800
pretty good job of

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,480
answering questions as they come in i

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,680
don't think i've seen any that dave

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,079
didn't already just pick

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,359
up um so is there anything

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,680
else left to say we don't have to stick

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,000
on here for the whole hour i think we're

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,000
almost at 40 minutes here there's i know

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,480
um we haven't got a chance to

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
talk william about uh about something

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,000
that you put together before this

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,520
do you want to say a little bit about

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,800
the yeah

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,200
yeah so uh i just got a 3d printer and

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,400
i'm like incredibly excited about it and

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,160
i had to move it into a different room

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,880
because my wife said it was too loud

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
because i'm jealous

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,640
[Laughter]

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,880
it's running like 24 7. uh so i had to

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,680
move it out of the room

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,200
it's right right behind the wall but you

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,240
know still kind of noisy

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,359
uh anyway so i designed a raspberry pi

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,640
case with the ubuntu logo on it um i

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,680
will drop the link

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,839
to thingiverse so um credit where credit

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,240
is due this is a remix of another design

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,480
that i added the ubuntu logo to

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,560
and then modified a little bit to make

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,320
sure it would work with hats

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,000
the original design wouldn't work if you

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,599
had any kind of hat on your pie so

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,160
there's a version that will work with

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,839
hats and then there's the original uh

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,200
structured model that uses fewer

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,880
standoffs so

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,880
i will get the link to that made up

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,320
and i have a lot of raspberry pi's like

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,760
like a lot like probably not as many as

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,440
dave but a lot more than most people

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,880
and they were like taking over my desk

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,839
like i really try to have a nice clean

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,400
desk area

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,400
and they just would show up like every

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,040
day

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,480
at the end of the day every day i'm like

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,119
where did all these raspberry pies come

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,850
from

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,320
uh so are they bleeding like triples yet

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:25,520
[Laughter]

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,560
i am working on a big old uh

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,119
stackable cluster of them essentially so

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,640
it's an

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,640
arbitrarily stackable number of these

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,680
there's one model for the top and bottom

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
and then another model

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,280
[Laughter]

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,720
so they'll mount up in the back like

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
this you can have

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,079
six in each one and then i'm gonna make

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,359
little custom mounts for things like the

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,560
compute module four

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,079
and uh the

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,440
3a that have different different

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,880
standoff dimensions so

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
this is going to be my next big thing i

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
print after a mini itx case

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,240
is finishing up this big old stack and

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,839
when that is done

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,640
i will put a how to do it

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,920
description uh step-by-step breakdown of

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,440
all the parts you would need if you ever

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,440
wanted to replicate this

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,280
and showing how it's assembled i'm gonna

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,680
put that up on my blog

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
when it's all finished but it's got you

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,480
know probably another

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,720
few days of printing because that's a

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,599
lot of filament

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,480
that's a lot of filament um okay the

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,160
just quickly then

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,599
so i'll start i'll wrap up in a second

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,160
but just quickly uh

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,280
daniel had a question uh that made me

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,359
clarify

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,480
why was you be used at all that is an

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,800
excellent question

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,760
um not one i can definitely i can

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,200
definitively answer

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
simply because it's before my time but i

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,800
can take a guess

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,760
um u-boot is used upstream by debian as

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,319
their default

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
for booting pretty much any single board

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,599
computer

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,359
and indeed the raspberry pi as well so

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,480
my guess would simply be

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,400
that it was included because that's what

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,240
debian did

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,119
and to be honest that's not a terrible

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,359
way of going about things

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,960
it turned out to be because the pie is a

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,680
very special snowflake when it comes to

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,400
booting

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,920
um it's very very different from almost

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,119
any other single board computer in that

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,319
sense

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,440
but from the point of view of of trying

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,680
to make an image

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,480
or trying to make multiple images for as

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,079
many single board computers as you can

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,079
uber's not a bad way to go it's a good

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,839
project it's well run it has

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,760
very wide ranging spot for lots and lots

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,680
of hardware unfortunately

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,680
it does make a few assumptions that um

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,000
that don't work terribly well on pi

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,800
especially with the way

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,520
and casting those versions here but for

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,040
example

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,720
raz pios um decided that the way to

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,839
handle the pi4 upgrade

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,240
very sensibly um was say take your sd

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
card

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,079
shove it in your existing pi pi three

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,560
three plus whatever

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,920
do your full app upgrade cycle there

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,720
shove that in your pi 4

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,920
jumps are good it'll boot but if you

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,760
think about it that means

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,480
you're taking the storage from one

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,839
machine and moving it to another

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,400
and this is common and a very common use

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,240
case

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
on the pi generally a lot of people

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,760
develop on a larger pile like a pi4 and

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,760
then deploy on something like pi zero

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,839
perfectly reasonable use case but a lot

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,520
of single book computers don't have

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,280
storage that goes wookies

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,200
they have embedded storage soldered onto

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
the board that does not go walkies

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,240
and youtube does make certain

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,160
assumptions about your storage not going

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,079
walkies

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,920
so for example in the ubud environment

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,800
it tends to write the

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,440
the usb ethernet address and serial

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,720
number

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
uh so these are cached in the

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,000
environment and then overwritten by ubus

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,160
on the next boot

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,920
uh this caused some considerable fun for

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,160
a customer that wound up with 48 pies

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,760
with the same address

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,839
not good yeah um

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
i i cannot definitively answer why

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,079
youboot was there but my guess would be

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,520
because that's what debian did and

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,560
therefore that's what the country will

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,040
end up doing

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,680
um but yeah so to say it's it's not

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,920
necessarily

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,319
the best fit and so this is the reason

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,000
we've moved away from it

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,960
cool all right great so uh as i say well

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,400
i think we'll start

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,680
we'll i'll wrap up a little bit here is

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
there anything else either of you wanted

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,880
to say or anything you wanted to

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,280
to broadcast a little bit here

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
just shake your hands if not um no not

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,480
that i don't think of no other than um

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,359
yeah please go check out g powell

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,760
on his shoot please shoot check out kick

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,359
some time

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,640
we'll publish some we've done a lot of

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,359
testing but we can't test everything

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,400
exactly exactly indeed and so if people

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,480
do do that that is though

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,520
i will also be publishing some things to

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,839
help people along

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,040
along the way um so thank you for

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,640
