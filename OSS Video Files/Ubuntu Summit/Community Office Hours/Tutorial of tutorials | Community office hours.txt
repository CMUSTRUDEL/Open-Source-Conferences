at the august desktop in dava at the end

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
of the month

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
i have not noticed any macaroni art yet

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
so people

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,200
joey is you know we still need to

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
to prove that there can be macaroni art

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
in the open source community so

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
if you've been waiting on that don't

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,159
forget to put that up

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
uh let's see we have some hopefully this

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
time

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,599
next week we will have kind of um

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,040
an update to give on the whole um

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,239
possible replacement for the gpg

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
key or an alternative to it for those of

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
us

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,159
like me who um when

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
aren't technically minded and it took

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,760
them hours to sign theirs

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,599
and so we will have um

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,519
kind of an update on how that's going

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,640
forward that was all spurred by mark

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,640
johnson's

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,920
proposal earlier this year and

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,680
what else um

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,680
i feel like there was something else

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,720
okay i think that that might be it for

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,080
the community

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
updates so i know that july is kind of i

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
think

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,560
everyone's going on vacation it's a bit

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,640
quiet

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,599
but i know that things especially as we

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
get closer to

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,959
october will just pick up so

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
and of course if you have any community

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,919
news just feel free to post it

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
on discourse on these on the threads

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
that we post

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
and we will be happy to let everyone

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,479
know

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,400
so uh moving on this is where

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,520
if i had better production value i'd

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,880
have a club i'd have a clever transition

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
here

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,360
but we are going to be going through

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,880
some ubuntu tutorials

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,440
so um who here in the chat

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,800
either in twitch or um

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
twitch or youtube has used one of the

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,960
two

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,960
tutorials or has maybe even written one

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
anyone

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,520
okay well let me share my screen and

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,000
this of course is going to be fun

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
because

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
um

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,880
okay i know sharing

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:38,400
screen works easiest on two monitors

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,240
but i don't have the other one so

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,240
it can deal all right

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,759
oh cool yeah the snap

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,639
tutorials i think are really helpful so

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
oh hey

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,400
so you did one for snap one for fl utter

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,880
and i have a feeling especially as we

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,479
start moving towards the new

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,639
uh the new launcher which is going

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
forward that's definitely a question for

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,120
the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
the desktop team and they're in dabbas

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,919
that we will have more flutter tutorials

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
um so that's awesome so what we are

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
going to do is we are going to go

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
through

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,600
the yeah the how to write a

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,400
tutorial and what i'm going to do here

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,960
is i'm just going to

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,319
share the link for those of you who

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
would like to follow

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,720
a long these are extremely helpful and i

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
think

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,560
i followed it when

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,880
oh my gosh when i got started for ubuntu

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,759
mate and there was something that we

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
wanted to put

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
on our website and i remember finding

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
one of the

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,639
tutorials and going this is extremely

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,680
helpful i think it was maybe on

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,240
burning and iso which was something that

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,160
before i started getting in involved

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
with open source i had no idea what

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
brennan and

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,560
iso meant and then i was having to do a

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,280
page on how to do it and i'm like

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
i need a site that tells me what this

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
process is

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,120
and the tutorial was just brilliant

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:21,360
so yeah so this is um so i don't know

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,560
when this was made but this is extremely

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,039
helpful and so um

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
so what we're going to do is to go

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,000
through this

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
so obviously this is a

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,039
kind of a template to help you get

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,199
started with the two

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,960
tutorials what's nice is that these are

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,080
made for

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,120
super beginners they're also made

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,080
for if you're writing far more advanced

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,000
tutorials you can mark them as such and

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,039
they can be meant for people with

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,599
a lot more experience

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
so this is just going to kind of be this

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
is

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
how did rhys put it when we were

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,840
figuring out what we would do

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,400
this is going to be maybe the most meta

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,840
ubuntu community office hours ever

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,240
because it's a tutorial on making

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,879
tutorials following a tutorial

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
but this is just kind of going through

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
markdown which

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,520
if you haven't used markdown it's great

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
um

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
kind of the the specific little quirks

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
of

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,640
markdown for the engine that we use

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,839
um rendering it locally to make sure it

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,120
looks the way you want

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,360
and how to get it ready for re review so

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,560
the documentation team can go

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,600
this is great and so

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,040
um so what you need to set this up

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,640
is an ubuntu discourse account

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,720
which when we're actually going to be

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
going we will be going through the

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,279
process of how to make that

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,519
and so um that will actually be

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,480
covered during the course if for some

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,160
reason you haven't joined the ubuntu

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,720
discourse yet so oh yeah i forgot other

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,519
bit of community news we have a new

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,120
ubuntu um okay we have a new ubuntu

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,320
member here

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,360
in the youtube chat we have

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,120
bigpot who was just voted in

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,040
this past week so congratulations

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,200
and i am uh and for those of you who

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
might be thinking about oh should i

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,399
apply for

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,880
membership if you have six months of

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,920
sustained

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,839
contribution to the project if you can

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:51,040
sign and adhere to the code of conduct

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:53,360
then and if you want to do more with the

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,240
with the project say you want to maybe

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,160
apply for

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,959
a motu or even a core dev one day

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,600
and uh or else if you maybe want to run

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
for

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,680
leadership in a few years and go

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,880
for membership it's a really great thing

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,040
and we also do have the um

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
certificate form back up and running

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
thanks to our

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,079
web team and so that is we have a

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
discourse post

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
about that so if you're a member and

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
don't have your certificate yet

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
go to that forum fill it it out and we

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
will

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,720
try to get those on the way as soon as

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
possible

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
all right and so again i will try to

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
answer

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,560
chat as quickly as i can i'm just doing

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
this on my thinkpad

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,680
so i miss that second monitor a lot

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,959
but um but reese is also here

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,839
in the comments and so

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,600
he will be able to help oh and he's

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
asking if

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,839
the tutorials can be translated and that

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,880
is a great question to ask because

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,800
having these a multiple languages

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,760
would really be helpful um

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,519
and if and if it's something that can't

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
maybe then that's something that we can

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,920
raise

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,640
that could be possibly possibly brought

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,839
up in the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,440
future again no guarantees but that

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,519
would be

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,920
very useful and ubuntu has an

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,640
amazing group of translators who we will

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,560
be bringing

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,760
on in a future session

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,120
all right so general

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,959
guidelines okay so

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,560
obviously there is a very wide audience

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,760
for

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,399
tutorials you're getting people who

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,720
learn in really different ways

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,079
you're getting people from different

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,639
experience and

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,720
skill levels and so you have to

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
craft a tutorial that's going to speak

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
to all of them

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,800
and so here you really want to keep it

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
small

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,000
and so what you're going to see in the

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,120
tutorial that we're going to write here

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,639
is literally how to sign on to

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,680
the commute like how to get started

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,200
with ubuntu with the ubuntu communities

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,120
com communication tools

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
like how do you sign up for launchpad

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,639
how do you sign up for discourse

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,160
how do you sign up for irc

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,040
kind of three very discreet things that

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,720
at the end of the

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,519
tutorial people will know how to do and

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,959
they will have

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,240
a launchpad account they will have a

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,839
discourse account and they will have

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,880
an irc nickname and be signed on to

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,800
some of the essential channels

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,279
so that's why you know that's why we're

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,959
following on the focus on one topic or

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,440
very small group of

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,160
related topics there are all three

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,880
things related to

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,079
communication there's a tangible results

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
we're going to get at the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:13,519
end which is you will have accounts on

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,920
all three of these things um be short

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,440
so this is something that ideally we

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:23,040
want people to be able to do

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,320
we would hope in 15 minutes or less

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:31,200
and so again this is something that is

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,079
meant to not take people a lot of time

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,160
have short manageable steps you don't

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,880
want and that's where

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,760
getting feedback helps because nobody

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,199
likes

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,320
tutorials where they have

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,240
where i don't know if you have seen like

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,600
the like the draw and owl

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,000
and it goes from like a collection of

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
like

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,279
rough shapes to a full-blown owl

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
you don't want that kind of tutorial

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,760
because then you're just like

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,639
how did they get from there to there you

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,839
want to

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,839
i mean you don't want to have like

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,040
just every microscopic steps but you

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
want to have a

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,600
clear succession of steps that tell

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,120
people what to do next

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,079
and that's when you get um

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,079
and that's when you get

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,959
good feedback especially with people who

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,680
are unfamiliar

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,040
with this so here like we would probably

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
bring this to someone who had

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
never done anything with the ubuntu

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
project who didn't know what launchpad

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,320
was it would maybe never use

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,839
discourse or irc and you would get them

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,240
to go through it

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
and if they could go through it without

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,079
too many many problems then you know

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,959
you didn't skip any steps and so

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,079
um and then you want and then also you

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,160
want it to be

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,360
you want it to be fun we always kind of

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,600
want to have a bit of

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,440
light-heartedness in our

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,279
writing uh and so just kind of

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,399
you know make it a make it a bit playful

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,160
don't make it

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,320
too joking and and again if you're

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,839
a primary english speaker you want to

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
kind of avoid

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,079
a lot of like um

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,079
what's the word

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,639
kind of things like metaphors emily's

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,000
kind of

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,720
um things that could

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,839
possibly be difficult to translate for a

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
non-primary

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,480
speaker so those are all things to keep

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,759
in mind and so yeah

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,079
friendly and the same tone and

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,600
again so if you kind of read through

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,240
this and see how they

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,680
do it then that's how your tutorials

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,800
should be and kind of you know we

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,079
like to use we and so it's like

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,199
you should but use things like we

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,600
and so um and so i think that this kind

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,480
of

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,440
gives you a good general overline of how

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,680
your tutorial

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,800
should should generally look

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,160
all right so tutorials

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,399
are built on they're built as a

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,639
single topic and so we're actually

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,880
i have too many um let's go through this

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
and then we're going to go through the

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,800
discourse post

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,040
and it's kind of tricky i wish i could

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,560
share two screens at once but i

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,399
don't think i can and so

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
we're we're just going to go through

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,320
this and then we'll do

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,959
we'll do the actual to we'll do the

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,959
actual tutorial at the end

00:16:50,959 --> 00:17:04,079
so actually oh

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:07,839
no no no no no bad bad bad

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,880
anyway so we know that we will click

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,839
that next

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
so title obviously you want it to be

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,760
kind of

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,880
short and sweet um

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,959
concise but specific which is which i

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,880
think is kind of a hard thing for

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,919
for people to do because sometimes

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,720
either or people get hyper specific but

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,840
more often

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,960
you get kind of vague and

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,520
it's like so you wouldn't want creating

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,880
a bootable usb it's like well

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,160
how are you creating that then but if

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,520
you're doing something

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,520
creating a bootable you at sb stick on

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,120
windows 10 now windows 11 then that

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,799
is much more focused for whoever is

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,240
going to

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,880
use that and you want to

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,760
if anything keep people from having to

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,400
click through too

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,360
many tutorials to get to yours help them

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,720
out with the

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,919
titles and to find exactly what they're

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,960
doing and so

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,240
here we each had and so your uh

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,280
and so the step

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,600
titles and if you haven't used

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
markdown hopefully that's something

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,799
that's a little bit

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,440
um marked and uh yes and so the markdown

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
render engine that we use is the one

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
that is

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,720
um inherently built in to

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
discourse so if you've ever used um

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,880
discourse it's that markdown

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,559
render engine which is good to know

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
which one that you're doing because

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,760
they're all a little different like if

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,280
you're doing markdown

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,480
for jekyll on github pages it is

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,039
slight there's some slight differences

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,360
and so but if you've ever posted to the

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,200
ubuntu community hub

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,440
or any other discourse it is the same

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
markdown that you use there

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
so

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,559
and so this is um so the

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
durations this is meant to give people

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
an

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,600
idea estimate but if you have time

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,799
you know of course to go through this

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,280
tutorial

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,679
and then to see how much time it does

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,440
take it's better to give people

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,640
uh as accurate and estim

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,240
made a time as it's going to be

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,559
and so here if we basically see what

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,919
this

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,280
is supposed to look look down we have um

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,960
what this is supposed to look look like

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,320
in markdown on discourse

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
it's nothing too exotic

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,520
which is really nice and that's i think

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
the whole point

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,120
of having documentation on

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,960
discourse is that it's easy to post

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,400
and markdown is just becoming more and

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,400
more common

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,760
and so theoretically this should be

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,360
kind of a low barrier of entry

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,000
for content creation on discourse

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,280
and we definitely are moving towards

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,559
this of wanting to have

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,720
more things there because they're just

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,320
accessible people can go back to them

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,840
people can link

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,880
to them it's extremely useful

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,280
and it's funny because you know

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,320
i know even i sometimes get in this trap

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,600
of just thinking well it's just a forum

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,760
and discourse is really a lot more than

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,120
a forum and it's got all these great

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,840
tools like this that you can use to help

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,480
build communities through better

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,520
documentation

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,520
so now that we've got the meta

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
data and the basic structure which is

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,919
pretty basic

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,600
we want to get to the content

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,919
all right

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,880
yeah big pot that is a good point and

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,640
i'm just going to bring this up here

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,559
every markdown implementation is

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,679
slightly different and that is

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,520
i in my opinion super annoying big pod

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,000
i agree because because if you're used

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,360
to

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,360
it working one way then you go to

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,559
something that uses a slightly different

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,480
implementation of

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,760
markdown it is frustrating

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,320
so so at the very least

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,000
i like that what this does is that it

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,640
tells you kind of

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
what are the things you need to know and

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
use

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,840
sp specifically for this

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
so all right

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
so you want the overview this is kind of

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
like because

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,440
when you are going through the tutorials

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,320
you want something really quick to let

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
you know

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,880
okay what is this tutorial about is this

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,200
relevant to what i need

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,559
you have a what you'll learn which gives

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
you a okay it's like

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,240
at the end of this tutorial

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,000
i'm gonna have this skill or i'm going

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,120
to have this particular bit

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,600
of knowledge awesome and then

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,280
what you'll need so obviously if you

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
were wanting to do

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,640
that bootable usb stick you would

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
obviously need a

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,960
usb stick if you were doing something

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,440
with an

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,600
sd card and so if there are

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,360
um especially i know that there are a

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
lot of raspberry pi

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,320
people uh who are in our community which

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,760
is fantastic i know that there

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,360
are some very talented um

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,640
some very talented raspberry pi people

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
right here in this chat

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,120
um french guy um see

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,400
eh who is doing some really cool things

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,159
on building stuff on pies

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
and so you would want to mention well

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,520
what maybe what specific kind of pie

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,400
would people need to have what kind of

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,559
um

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,480
media would they need all those kinds of

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,080
things and yes discourse is

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,120
open source and it is that's and it

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,200
is i believe if you have an open source

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,559
project that you either have a

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,159
vastly reduced or possibly

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,200
free usage of discourse i'm not quite

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
sure

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,039
but um i know that they try to make

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,039
themselves as

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,480
useful and as easy to use to open source

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,760
projects as possible

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,559
which is awesome and just the community

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,679
tools

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,600
and dashboards are it's really great if

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
you have been thinking of giving it a

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
try

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,080
and you can also self-host discourse

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,120
which is something that

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,159
definitely our community is really

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,320
really well positioned to use so

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,520
that could even be a tutorial just

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,720
saying all right

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,279
so this so the summary so

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
we got kind of here's what to put in the

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,240
summary

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,200
and then we have um

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,720
kind of how we're going to do it in mark

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,919
down here

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
and so here we have again that double

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,679
hash

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,799
for the overview we again

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,720
have that duration which is you know

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:54,240
it'll take people about a

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,240
minute to read it and so

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,520
okay so here what they're doing is this

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,840
is something

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,159
oh turning a website into a desktop

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,159
integrated app

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:16,320
and then here and then so this is this

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:20,799
the set the set memory set section here

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,320
so basically about

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,760
two sentences long and then it gives you

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,600
a link to the website so

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,520
fairly easy and then what you'll have

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,640
under that is going to be what you'll

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,240
learn

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,919
and this uh and this has the three

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,360
hashes and then it's presented with

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
bullet points

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,279
so the mark down here i know that some

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
instances of markdown use the asterisk

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,840
for

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,919
bullet points here evidently we use the

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,640
dashes so again going back to what big

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,799
broad said there's individual quirks

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:08,240
of markdown on different platforms

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:12,720
and so and okay and the what you'll

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:17,200
need is here we see that you can use it

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,159
for kind of not only physical

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,960
hardware but also what kind of knowledge

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,400
what kind

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,960
of what kind of basic um

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,480
fundamental skills do you need to do

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,679
this

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,240
tutorial which is good

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,880
because this can especially if you're

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,400
getting

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,440
something that is the slightly um

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,520
above a beginner level

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,720
then that would be really helpful like

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
if i would see this

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,840
i would be like well i have an ubuntu

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,640
desktop 1604 or higher

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,200
i have some very basic command line not

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,760
knowledge i feel like i could actually

00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
do this

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:08,159
and oh this is kind of a little bit of

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,120
a bonus but you but

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,919
we have these surveys that you can build

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,320
in

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,200
so if you're wanting to really get some

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,559
feedback

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,440
on a tutorial that you make

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,039
then you can add that and this would be

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,919
a really great thing

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,679
to copy paste yes we do use google

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,720
analytics as the

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,679
survey backend and so i know

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,279
that um everyone has their own comfort

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,520
level with that

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,399
and so again this is something

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,240
completely

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:47,279
option you know and you can choose to

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,520
use it or choose to not have it in there

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,640
all right and so when we put all this

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,919
together

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,200
here's what the markdown is going to be

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,919
so overview with the double hash the

00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,039
direction

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,320
about two sentences to describe

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,640
what it is that we're going to do links

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,080
to anything that you might use

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,840
then a maybe two or three bullet points

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,600
about what you're going to

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,559
learn using the dash and then

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,159
about and then a short description of

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,360
either what hardware

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,520
or what basic skills do you need

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:33,679
and so this kind of gives you just

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,679
here's here's the basic step

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,480
yes they are reviewed afterwards

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,559
and so they are free reviewed by the

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,320
documentation team okay

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,679
so basically on dues and and do's and

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,600
don'ts

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:57,840
and so you want

00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:01,200
um so five to ten

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,320
per step is i is

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,399
ideal you don't want to

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,360
like i would say for what we're going to

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,200
do like

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,600
filling out the single web page

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,840
would probably be a step rather than

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,200
having each box you fill out be

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,480
a step and of course uh you know this

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,960
is again if you want feedback on these

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,399
that this is a great thing to ask

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,720
someone it's like

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,559
do these steps do they seem way too

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,279
involved and complicated

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,640
and long or do they just seem choppy and

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,679
short

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,679
and again if this is if

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,039
it feels like this is starting to get

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,640
long

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:47,440
then think about well is this a stage

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,960
and is this maybe just it's like is this

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,399
a first stage of

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,960
of a broader tutorial

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
and is this second part that i that i

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,679
started should it really be

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,039
its own tutorial and

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,799
again think about okay well for this

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,080
part i have this

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,080
specific goal in mind but if you notice

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,679
that it's like oh wait now it seems like

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,640
we're on this completely

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
separate goal that's when it might be

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,919
good to spin that

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,880
off into its own into its own tutorial

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
there

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,480
and so if you think about it it's almost

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,960
like

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,039
paragraphs when you're writing an essay

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,240
you want each of them to be about a

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,600
distinct thing and if you start noticing

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
that what you're doing

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,720
really doesn't have anything to do or is

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,520
only tangentially related to what you

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,799
started

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,760
doing that's a sign that maybe it needs

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,200
to be its own

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,039
separate content yeah okay

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,720
so don't have too many steps

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,840
so i don't know about you i'd love to

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,960
cook

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,159
i've seen recipe books that have

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,840
like 25 different steps for one

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,200
recipe then one of those steps

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,640
is a link to a recipe that itself

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,200
is 25 steps and guess what i don't make

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
those

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,039
recipes because that is just way too

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,679
long

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,880
so think about you know you've got

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,559
someone

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,039
who you don't want to have like to

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,240
to have them go oh my god i'm only on

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,080
step five of

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,720
how many make it you know

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,919
again five to ten steps if you if you

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,440
start getting into the high teens

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,960
some either your tutorial is too long

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,240
and there's kind of a bunch of content

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,880
together that needs to be split or

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,399
you're dividing your your steps into too

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,440
small of a bucket

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,519
again this is a thing that getting

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,519
feedback from people and having people

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,640
actually try to follow them that will

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,679
really help you and

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
also think of this this is a great thing

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
it's kind of like okay

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,159
it's kind of like one of those choose

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,840
your own adventure books

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,279
but with one certain

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,159
and so you want to have a feeling that

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,559
when they've

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,640
gotten that step done that they really

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,360
have accomplished

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
something and so that they feel like all

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,039
right

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,320
i can do this i feel ready and excited

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,679
to go on to

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,039
that next step now this one we're not

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,440
really going to do this

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,320
in our tutorial that we're going to make

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,799
here because

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,919
we're not going to make intentional

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,440
mistakes on a

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:49,760
website that's kind of mean but

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,760
sometimes learning um

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,080
learning to fix your errors

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,919
like um oh my gosh like when i learned

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,039
how to knit

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,600
learning how to screw up and recover

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,600
from those

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,519
mistakes or hot shot driving we've got

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,399
some of

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
the fellow drivers here i practice

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,080
running into walls

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,159
so i could get out of that so sometimes

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,799
especially if you're making for um if

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,000
you're making a tutorial

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,880
for something that is

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,960
that can be tricky and it's easy for

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,080
people to mess up and

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,039
frustrating when you mess up

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,880
some maybe guide them through that it's

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,120
like okay it's like we're just going to

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,760
kind of do this the wrong way

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,880
see what that looks like see how you

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,640
recover

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:51,200
from that and that can give people

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,240
a lot of of confidence

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,600
when they inevitably mess up when

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,760
they're actually

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,440
doing it so i think that even though

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,679
this doesn't apply to

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,080
ours um i think that this will

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,320
that this could be really helpful for

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,440
some of the more technically

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,960
minded ones so

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,639
i think we're going to kind of pause

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,000
there so first of all

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:26,399
and sorry um i see anthony and

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,399
the um in the

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,839
youtube chat so that would be a great

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,800
question for something like

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,760
our indaba and i see that thankfully

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
there are some

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,040
community people who are being awesome

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,639
and answering

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,639
you but um the community office

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,399
hours uh right now we're just going

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,760
through

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,720
making a tutorial and i'm really good

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,200
with people

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,399
less good with the tech side of things

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,440
so but thank you for

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,320
answering those and again uh we'll

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
be having our next desktop in on our

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,760
next desktop in daba at the end

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,800
of july and those would be great

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,320
questions

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,800
for that all right so i'm going to

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
remove

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,640
all right and now i'm going to share a

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,640
new screen

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
all right

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
window

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,680
all right oh actually i'm going to go

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
back to this

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
haha

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:47,920
so

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
i think it this was in the

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,040
edit data and structure and what we'll

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,680
do here

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,880
so it's a little bit easy to kind of

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,839
just toggle back

00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,839
and forth

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,119
i don't what quite that was

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,280
oh because i clicked the wrong button

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,359
that's what

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
also we really need to get some

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,680
background

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,400
music for these streams because i don't

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,200
know it's just

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,599
it's really weird to do this with no

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,560
music and just having it be completely

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,839
silent

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,320
so um for those of you who streamed on

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
twitch

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,720
it is nice to kind of have those um

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,160
those

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,440
background tools and so these are where

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,000
all the tutorials live and so

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,160
these would be the ones that would

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,200
possibly get uploaded

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,320
and put on the tutorials page

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,200
so this is kind of where this is where

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,480
they would go

00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,240
first and so we're going to make

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,240
a new topic

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:09,839
all right and so title

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,839
is like

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:23,200
i'm getting started with community

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:28,800
communication tools

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,800
all right so that's there

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,240
and so i think that we have done a good

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,240
job with keeping our titles sp

00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:42,560
specific um

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,080
but also kind of short and so

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,680
again we want to

00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,800
[Music]

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,119
introduce our content

00:37:48,800 --> 00:38:05,839
all right and so we have

00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:05,839
our overview

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,280
let's see um

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,839
to the ubuntu project

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,440
there are several

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,440
communication

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
pools

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:40,400
that we use

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,400
these include lunch pad

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,839
this course

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,839
i think that we will actually use it

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
what you are reading now

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,000
and irc

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,160
in this tutorial

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,640
you will go through how to

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,640
set up

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:29,040
counts on all three

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:33,200
of these platforms

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,920
um and to

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
get started

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,640
okay so here

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,839
we've got the overview there oh i almost

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:57,839
for

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:57,839
almost forgot duration

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,960
popping back into chat everything seems

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,960
everything seems good for now

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:25,839
good to know all right

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,839
and now we want to go back to

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,800
okay what you'll learn all right then we

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,800
know we need the three

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,839
three hashes

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,760
anyone who's listening watching

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,880
etc etc

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,359
are there any tutorials that you have i

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,200
mean

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,599
okay besides the fact that i really hope

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,079
we can get the translation thing started

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,400
because that would be fantastic

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,640
are there any two are there any

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,280
tutorials that people here have been

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,079
thinking of that you would like to make

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,560
or you would like

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,560
to see

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
what you'll learn

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,720
let's see that is weird um

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,319
it's just the dash makes the dot that's

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,880
so strange

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,880
what you'll

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:35,839
to create an account

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:35,839
on lunch pad

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,720
into single sign-on

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,839
let's see

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,240
how to create an account on discourse

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,839
how to register

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,319
a nic on

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:09,440
irc and join the

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,440
um the two channels

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,200
all right there seem like three really

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,200
distinct goals

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,720
can we get a tutorial on how to make

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,760
cheesecake

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,319
maybe on a very special episode of the

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,240
ubuntu community office hours where we

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,319
get the cooking of ubuntu

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,440
people to come and as long as yannick

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,800
you promised to

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,800
um we got a

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,119
question here of can we get a tutorial

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,400
on how to make

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,480
cheesecake so i was just saying if we

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,480
ever get the cooking of ubuntu

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,160
people then i would love to do something

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,640
like that um but it would be hard

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,760
because then we would all just get even

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,720
hungrier than we normally would would be

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:13,839
so all right what you'll learn and what

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,839
you'll need

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,880
see and what you'll need is

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,800
um

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,800
this computer

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,359
with internet access

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,440
and probably

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
a

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,880
oh an email address

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
access

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:06,240
okay it seems like

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,839
it's it seems pretty

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,839
solid there so

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,359
yeah food is always going to come up

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,560
sooner or later i finally got to my tea

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,000
that i brewed

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:26,720
um for this which is really nice

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,720
and oh my gosh i just need because

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,280
i guess for some reason did not get a

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,000
good night's sleep

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,560
last night but which is funny as i'm

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,319
trying to put all this to together

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,680
all right so now we've got the overview

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,079
so now we have

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,520
step so if we think about it

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,520
step one is going to be

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,880
create a launchpad

00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,510
which is going to be hilarious because i

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:00,510
[Music]

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,319
all right now i need to get a new screen

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,680
share

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,560
oh how to run gui applications inside

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,760
lxc

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,359
containers okay that

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:21,920
that sounds really cool

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,920
so oh and i'm going to post this because

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
i think that would be an idea not only

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,400
for an awesome

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,880
tutorial but i know that you all do

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,520
video podcasts on twitch that would also

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,720
make some

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,240
great content and i would totally watch

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,520
that

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,800
all right so now i have to

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,000
get a different screen share

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,160
it's kind of un fortunate

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,160
that i can't change this

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,760
okay i love all the people are just

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,720
talking about how they

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,880
enjoy cooking because why what what

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,160
ain't you

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,920
i did make um around the time i got

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,960
um i became an ubuntu member last year i

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,240
did make this

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,319
pumpkin this it was like a

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,400
cheater cheesecake because it didn't

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,640
take like hours to set but it was like

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,359
this pumpkin cream cheese and i tried to

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,720
make the

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,000
ubuntu ogo in it and it kind of didn't

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,079
come out

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,480
really well but this is going to be um

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,440
for many of you watching this might seem

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,079
really

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,400
familiar but hopefully if maybe you're

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,280
watching this and you're kind of new

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
then you're um then i think it's good to

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,480
walk through it

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,880
like we were doing this the first time

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,680
so i have signed out

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,560
and so that way you're not just kind of

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,960
doing it from

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,880
memory you're following these steps just

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,720
like somebody would be doing

00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,960
using your tutorial

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
so

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:11,440
all right well this is going to be

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,680
awkward because obviously i use this for

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,680
everything here all

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,599
all right we're going we're just going

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,119
to use that

00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,839
and then i'm going to find a way to

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,839
delete this

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,839
account okay so this so this would be

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,839
good when we

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,839
would

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:53,839
actually this would be a great chance to

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:53,839
take a screenshot

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,440
so and

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,880
this is when oh yeah we just go to print

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,880
screen

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,640
and so i know that there are places

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,880
where we can

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:17,839
add images to our tutorials

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:21,839
and so just let people know

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,839
all right

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,839
now i have to sorry about that

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,839
okay create a launchpad account

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,839
navigate to

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,680
and here this is thankfully something

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,520
that is the same

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,960
across disk courses navigate to

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:50,960
uh the launchpad

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,960
account creation page

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,160
and then you just

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,559
there we go wrong

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:11,920
separate readers we just took that link

00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,800
that we went into and we just add that

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,680
in there and

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:21,280
you can see that it is um

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,000
okay i will switch back to this

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,720
and again i'm sorry that we can't be

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,240
sharing

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,240
multiple screens so

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,160
actually i think i know what i uh no i

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,280
can't

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:40,240
do that all right

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,240
get to the launchpad account creation

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
page

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,440
enter your and then if we go back to

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,200
this which is i think what you all are

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,760
still seeing

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,760
um either your email

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,400
for your email

00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,599
address

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,599
toggle the

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:27,839
i don't have an ubuntu one account

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:54,559
okay go back

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:58,319
please enter your full name

00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:02,240
select a

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,240
username and password

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:12,240
and

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,240
oh um

00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:22,880
let's see of course

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:28,079
read and accept

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,079
read and accept the

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,440
terms of service

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:41,040
data privacy policy

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,040
and canonicals

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:51,550
so obviously notice

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,669
it's um

00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,669
[Music]

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,200
okay so we would do this i'm just going

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,200
to make

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,839
well see

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,599
literally this is going to be a

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,839
throwaway

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:31,040
account i'm so sorry

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:34,720
um i'm just going to use

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,720
yeah um

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,920
username

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,920
because i have this stupidly obscure

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,800
last name i think there's less than a

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,040
thousand

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,400
of us in the world with this last name

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,400
so

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,400
here it's always good just you know

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,359
sorry if you got to see that password

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,160
i'm never going to use this account

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:05,200
again and i'm going to be deleting

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:10,480
eating it so and i'm going to hit

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,480
yes and i'm going to hit create

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,839
account

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:23,920
okay and then oh um so now

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,920
we know what the next step is

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,839
launchpad account

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:43,839
verify your launchpad account

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,319
yeah it

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,480
really is amazing and that's why it was

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,119
such a pain it's like oh wait i have to

00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,599
make

00:53:53,119 --> 00:54:00,079
a new ubuntu sso and

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,480
that is like oh that's so frustrating

00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,960
because everything i use not only for

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,599
work

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,520
but for um but for

00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:12,559
communities on things just

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,839
involves the ubuntu so

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:18,640
and it is really useful

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,760
and there's some things coming down the

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,960
road to make it even

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,880
more useful which is really awesome

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,280
and so that's why we're putting this one

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,400
first because once you get

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,319
launchpad and your ubuntu sso

00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,240
then you can use that to sign into

00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,480
discourse and so obviously

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,359
we would want to put that before the

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,359
signing up for discourse because then

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,200
we'd be doing it backwards and we

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:46,319
wouldn't want to

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,960
do that and i am going to switch really

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,400
quickly

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,400
sorry remove

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:58,079
except let me reshare my screen

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,599
so you all can see what i've been doing

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,799
thus far

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:05,200
it's interesting that this is actually

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,000
weirdly enough even though documentation

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,040
is kind

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
of my bread and butter this is the first

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,480
time i've actually

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,680
done kind of live documentation on

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,680
screen

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,839
um and i wouldn't share the wrong thing

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,839
this is probably why

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,079
well you guys are definitely getting an

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,520
idea of how

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:39,440
our work really goes kind of hiccups

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:43,599
and all so let's see

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,599
latest tutorials there we go

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:52,559
all right so let me go back to this

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,680
other chrome window

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,680
so we followed

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:04,720
oh so we've followed this

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,799
and then you see this is the nice thing

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,119
that discourse does is that it just

00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:12,160
shows you how it's going to

00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,200
how it's going to look which is just

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,799
really really handy

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:23,520
and so um we kind of see

00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:26,880
that it gives us all the basic steps

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,040
and here we see that we've done

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,000
kind of what we've done here to make the

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,280
address

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,960
shows up as an actual link there

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,440
and we've walked people through the

00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,440
basic steps so that first step

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,640
yes it does have these five steps but

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,920
it's just

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,200
uh we're still keeping it fairly simple

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,280
here

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:53,200
and then and and then what we would do

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,920
last is we would ask people

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,040
the next step we would do would be to

00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,200
ask people to verify your launchpad

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,720
account and which is just hey go to the

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,839
email you just

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:09,680
you just set it up

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,240
and then make sure that we know it's you

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,079
and what i would probably do after this

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,319
is because

00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,200
this is pretty good at the basic

00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:21,920
information

00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,920
it is not exactly the most i don't know

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,680
it is not exactly the most

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,160
lively prose yet so i would probably go

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,440
through

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:34,559
and edit and so that's which is

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,640
another thing drafts drafts are

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,920
wonderful

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,480
and start with like a rough skeleton and

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,040
then

00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,280
i just kind of each pass you know it's

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,240
like okay is the content good okay how

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,200
is the tone

00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,200
is this clear and because that would

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,880
that's something i definitely noticed

00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,400
going through it's like okay

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:59,839
we have all the basic info awesome

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,400
um do we have like um that sense of you

00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,960
know

00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,599
fun that makes the reader want to follow

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,720
along

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,559
and keep going maybe not yet and so

00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,160
that's what i would do in that

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:14,799
next pass and so unfortunately we're

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,240
kind of starting to wind down

00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:21,599
um but our but before we close up

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,440
um does anybody have any

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,400
questions besides on the podcast ubuntu

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,440
portugal i am

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,760
super looking forward to not only seeing

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,799
your

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:36,000
tutorial but to seeing how you

00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:39,280
put it in action especially if you do

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,880
a stream about that that would be great

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,000
um but i hope that this has been a

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,160
um like and i wish we could have gone

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,440
through all of the steps i'm so

00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,440
sorry about that um but this is

00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,040
something that we can also pick up

00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,480
too and i could you know i could

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,079
okay and i think especially

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,160
as we go through kind of um how does one

00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,079
of these make it to the official

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,000
tutorial page

00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,400
maybe we could even bring someone on

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,720
from the documentation team to talk

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,319
about that and i think that would be

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,000
rhys if you're l

00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,640
listening i think that'd be a great

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,640
guest you know so they can say

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,799
what do they look look for in a good

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,880
tutorial what are some ones that they

00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,559
what are some tutorials that they know

00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,280
that they need

00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,000
so uh we can definitely have a chat with

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,359
our

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,680
co-workers and friends and to

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,000
find out kind of that half of how the

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,480
tutorials works because

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,760
getting them up on discourse not a

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,079
problem

00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,760
but we want to help you especially if

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,079
you write something really great

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,520
how do you get that to the tutorials

00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,720
page

00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:58,160
so any

00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:00,799
questions thoughts

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,760
what is everybody going to go eat after

01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,319
this because

01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,880
damn it some cheesecake actually sounds

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,839
you know

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,200
maybe not cheesecake but we've got a

01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,440
coffee shop in this new

01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,839
apartment complex and they do a pretty

01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,559
good cheese danish just saying

01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:20,559
and it stopped raining and i'm thinking

01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,359
a walk down there to finish up work

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,599
might be nice i'm gonna blame all of you

01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:29,839
for whatever pastries that i get

01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,839
just saying

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,640
all right well anyway for all of you who

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
came and

01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,880
all of you who might be watching again

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,240
thank you so much and please if you

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,400
think about to

01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,359
like what and if you're trying to think

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,839
of what

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:50,240
what would i make a tutorial on and just

01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,559
think of what is something that you know

01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,839
that man you really wish you would have

01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,559
known when you

01:00:53,839 --> 01:01:01,119
got started um i will post a picture of

01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,079
me enjoying said pastry and post it up

01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,520
on discord

01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,599
or twitter or somewhere that's about the

01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,000
extent of sharing

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,839
pastries one day whenever we all get

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,680
together oh my gosh i will

01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:16,319
so share pastries but until now it would

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,480
you know

01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,760
it it would take so long to get wherever

01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,040
you are then

01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,599
i should just enjoy it for everyone

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,319
no i want to eat pastries well i'm sure

01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:31,440
there's a pastry providing facility

01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:35,119
somewhere near you that will

01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:38,400
hook you up with pastries just saying

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,480
