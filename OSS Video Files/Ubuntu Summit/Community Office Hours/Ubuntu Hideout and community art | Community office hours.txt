00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
chair in

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
our cabin curled up with a cup of tea

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
and

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
that's kind of the way to do these

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,079
things honestly we just need to

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,559
make it super casual oh well

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
just it was super casual it was really

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
good though anyway we when we i was

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,280

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
community

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
and talking about ubicon asia it was

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
good yeah

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,560
and if you did not watch that last week

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,600
a you missed an awesome one but

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
if you go to our youtube channel we have

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
all of them recorded and i think the

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,920
video on demand

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
is still on twitch so you can watch it

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
here too it doesn't keep it

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
as long but on youtube it lives for

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,560
forever

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
you know forever as long as their

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,920
servers stay up

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,759

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,200
group of people i can't wait to go

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,840
to an ubu con asia in person because

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,479

you become france folks the other week i

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
think it's just

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,210
fair to say that ubu khan's in general

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680

so tell us um how did the two of you

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,479
how did you all get into ubuntu as as a

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,680
fairly recent

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,199
ubuntu person myself i love hearing

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,720
about how people

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:10,240
got started well um i guess i

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,160
guess i'll start to be honest i kind of

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
i've kind of been on enough ubuntu

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
like because when i when i was a very

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
young

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,639
like when i was very young about the age

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,680
of four i i got a laptop that was like a

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
acer aspire 1 i think it was and the

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,199
version of ubuntu

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
it came with ubuntu which is quite funny

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,600
actually

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
i'm just trying to think of what version

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
that would have been so

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,479
um it would have been about nine point

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,440
it would have been

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,080
ubuntu nine i think about that would

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,199
that be

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,039
oh man this is like the worst pop quiz

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
it's like what was

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
um somebody in oh wow we should know

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
this

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
we should know this jaunty uh hey our

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400

okay and so and so tell us more

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,400

doing this when you were four

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,880
yeah when i was four well when i was

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
about four years old obviously i didn't

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,880
know how computers worked so it was more

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
of just playing about with them

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,120
and um due to due to hardware upgrades

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,840
obviously um i think i i went off linux

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
for a bit

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,240
and then you know it was about up until

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,639
about three years ago when i started to

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,039
you know experiment with a software a

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,240
bit more and i was like

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,039
i may as well try out ubuntu again um

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
you know i was 100 three years ago what

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,800
happened three years ago to get you up

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
uh

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,039
to get you going again i don't know i

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
the way i work is i usually get

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,560
spontaneous

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
like you know i get spontaneous

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,039
interests of

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,960
um topics so i'll just like i mean

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,560
ubuntu looked like a very easy um

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
software to install so

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
you know i just gave it a gave it a shot

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
and i was very

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,680
unsure about it so i had it as a dual

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800
boot for a while

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,159
however i guess this is i guess like

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
about a year ago i

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,800
i joined ubuntu hideout where you know i

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,080
asked them a bunch of questions and they

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,159
helped me out with ubuntu

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
now i understand it a bit more and i

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
know more about the software if you know

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
what i mean

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
i'm no expert still but i'm still

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
learning everyone's still learning i

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
guess

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,920
everyone is still look earning and i

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
would say even the people who've been

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,120
here from the start

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
would probably still say that they have

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,800
things to learn

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,240
so but it's really great to hear that

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
you uh that you came to it as

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040
the place that it looked like it was

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
easy to install it was an approachable

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,959
type of thing

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
i think that's something that we really

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,480
wanna that ubuntu in general wants to

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
really sort of strive for is

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
being able to be accessible to people

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,959
even if it's just a gateway to other

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,800
linuxes

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
i think that's a it's a good place to be

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,399
of course

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,680
yeah and dan llewellyn in the

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,240
youtube chat has just said that he knows

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,839
nothing that's really humble but that's

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,959
also kind of a lie

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,800
jan dan knows a lot of things

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,959
so and so rowley i think that you're in

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,440
the twitch chat so if you have like a

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,320
quick if you want to post like a quick

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
kind of

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,200
comment there on when you got started

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
i'd also love to hear of how you got

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,920
into ubuntu mate this is me with

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,040
my ubuntu contributor hat on

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,040
um because that um because that was the

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,160
first ubuntu flavor i got

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,640
into and it's the one i've stuck with so

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
yeah so would love to hear about that

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
and i love

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
seeing okay there's more people who

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
started using

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
ubuntu when they reese i think they

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,040
meant three

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
or four i mean they could have been

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,240
using it at nine months

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,040
which you know babies are old enough to

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
like if

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,279
someone maybe had like an ubuntu phone

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,680
they could have someone just

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,320
swap type in yeah i don't think we

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
talked about their

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
different we don't talk about what

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
they've been defending

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,279
oh really is that there you go awesome

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,120
so i first heard about ubuntu in 2016

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,959
then i got a chance to install it on my

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,640
dad's laptop after he screwed up ubuntu

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
i think probably a lot of people in the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,200
chat can empathize

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,519
with that i used ubuntu for a while but

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,399
since it had two gigabytes of ram i had

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,440
to find a lot either alternative

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,680
oh erection installed on my dad's old

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,839
laptop in 2019

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,399
when he screwed up windows wit endos

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,440
that is that's actually how my husband

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,880
got started he

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,880
literally blew up his windows computer

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,720
and didn't have the money

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,680
to um get a new operating system

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,720
so and he and he had a disc so

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,079
that's three right stories

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,519
so it broke it totally

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,800
broke oh my goodness yeah so

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,240
roli which ubuntu um which

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:43,279
ubuntu did you start with and maybe also

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,320
how did you find your way to the hideout

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,079
good question and i love how ken has

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
stated that all three of my kids got

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,399
started with ubuntu at about four

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
so can we expect to see their

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,839
applications in

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
for uh you know

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,360
that's that is awesome though i used

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
we do that i used ubuntu then kabuntu

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
then

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,680
do mate on that laptop perfect that's

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,360
exactly the kind of thing we like to

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
hear people trying ubuntu trying other

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
things

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
did you settle on one you certainly want

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
a particular are you still using mate or

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,320
are you using something else

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,399
oh and actually single boot fedora

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,480
nice cool

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
in october 2020 i dual booted ubuntu on

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
my current laptop

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,720
and now i single boot fedora and you're

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,240
settled on a fedora workstation

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,839
great awesome so

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,680
and so both of you obviously are

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,800
wonderfully artistically talented

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,000
and and how long have you both been

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,040
doing

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,240
um kind of artwork and kind of all

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
things kind of

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
graphical

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,000
um i guess i'll speak here yeah

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,760
you go first i think with artwork as

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
as with the software thing it was kind

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
of just like a mixture of you know

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
curiosity

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
and spontaneous enthusiasm that you know

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,079
i just i was just like

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
one day i was just sitting there i was

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,160
like okay i want to do art now

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,440
so i think it was the first thing i

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,079
learned in

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,839
which um you know i just i just kind of

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
installed and messed about making i

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,600
think it was just

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,920
small artworks or thumbnails and stuff

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
and

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,560
yeah you know eventually i i got to

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,160
learn a bit more about it

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,279
um i'm not a particularly great artist

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,160
but i that's why i found raster editing

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,639
software a lot easier for me to use

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,320
and you know i just kind of fit i just

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
i'm sorry i just kind of fiddle about

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,240
with it i guess and i found it enjoyable

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,440
okay as as someone who's kind of

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,920
really new to a lot of this what is

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,199
diff what makes rasta art different

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,279
um rasta r is kind of just um

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,120
i'm very bad at explaining so please

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,639
bear with me

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
no worries that is okay and and if you'd

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
like

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
kind of uh we're gonna have like uh kind

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
of share your screen and show

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
and tell so if you would if showing us

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,880
would be better

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,079
then we can totally kind of table that

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
question

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
so yeah i'll table it because i'm very

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
bad at explaining

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,720
uh bear with me a second i'll i'll just

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,360
get my screen up

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,279
okay no so actually

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,120
rowley had a pretty good simple

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,160
explanation

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,320
raster uses pixels

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
it's an x it's kind of like a vector

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,519
uses shapes

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,399
thank you interesting um

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,120
there you go it's the screen okay so

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,639
let's

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,760
add to stream so woohoo that's my art

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
submission i

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
submitted to the ubuntu hideout art

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,480
contest that

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
monica mentioned in the beginning um i

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
decided to kind of take like a unique

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,079
approach with it and

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
you know i i was thinking you know what

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,120
what can i associate with like kind of

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,399
like a hideout or a club

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,040
because so i thought kind of the good

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,519
way of doing

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
it would to be making like a neat like a

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
neon

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
sign if you know what i mean yeah

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,199
because you know that always gives kind

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,639
of like a cozy

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
feeling because of the warmth for the

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,839
colors and such

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,480
that is a great use of that orange i

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,519
i and also there's a great conversation

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
about

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,800
the canonical people bringing up their

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
kids right

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,040
and teaching their kids to say ubuntu

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:45,360
into like aubergine and orange

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,000
so that is that is really nice

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,360
how did you the uh the what i presume is

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
so we're gonna paint splash around the

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,639
background is that something that you

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,480
that you made did you make the little

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
the outlander um

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
i originally i did not create it i'm not

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
too sure how

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,600
like who created it however it's a it's

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,000
a logo used by the ubuntu hideout um

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,480
you know the the community and they gave

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
me access to the svg for it so i took

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,560
that and kind of outlined it

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,560
with a glow awesome yeah

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
that does look really good we've got

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,480
some people who i know are

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,240
from the ubuntu hideout here and so

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,079
maybe if they have any comments

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,560
about how they came up with the logo

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
then feel free to put those in and just

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,880
oh

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,040
that's actually cool and

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:43,120
rolly has a comment here

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,079
huh i just ran in svg tray acer

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,920
that is really cool definitely above my

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,800
skill grade because i'm just kind of

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,440
like

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
yeah i've played a little bit with like

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320


00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,240
and i've played a little bit with krita

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
and i get out of my comfort zone

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,800
super fast so showcase yourself

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,400
yes so and first i want to go back to

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,520
rolly's comment here

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,280
of kind of that

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,600
rolly how did you get started where did

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,480
you get come from i've been doing art of

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,799
my life

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,679
uh but since 2017 i've been doing vector

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,439
art which is

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,799
like you said shapes instead of pixels

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,079
raster this is vector

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,120
super interesting so we are going to add

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,120
this to the screen

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,640
and i do believe i recognize some of

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,160
these cut

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,960
colors here yeah i just want to say who

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
here has the

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,640
ubuntu colors

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,720
memorized by their hex code oh wow

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
yeah that's fun escape is a feature

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,039
where it can trace png

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
and i do both kinds of art oh okay we do

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,160
both

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,000
uh raster and vector cool

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,440
oh is it that's the aubergine in the

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
orange you're making oh cool

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
and then you got the latte what is what

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,799
is the uh

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
mate green is there is there a proper

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,280
name for that

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,840
chelsea cucum umber and if yannick

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,320
is in the chat he know he has the hex

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
code met

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,200
he also has yeah nice

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,039
so yeah and so i love kind of seeing um

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,240
the the progression

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,200
in rowley's art because when he did the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,960
yarrow

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,480
back um wallpapers for for us

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,280
he did both a light and a dark

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
um that was uh pretty much okay i'm

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
going to try and get this right that was

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,039
like a like

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,160
a solid piece of artwork and now he's

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
gone and made it

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,240
transparent uh but then he went and made

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,520
it transparent

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,440
so it will basically it will change

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
because we have that really cool color

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,200
changing feature in ubuntu

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,679
mate so if you don't like chelsea cuc

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,280
umber and that shade of green you can

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,480
make it be like teal

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,240
and i actually have it teal now

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,480
but i but hopefully that kind of what he

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,840
should owing us and and if you need to

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,679
put some kind of explanations in chat

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,720
as to how that transparency works

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,120
because rolly was showing me this

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,640
in discord chat yesterday and i was like

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,360
this is the coolest thing

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
ever oh yeah it's i mean it's kind of

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,240
mesmerizing just watching

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
just watching the screen here just yeah

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
i think we're coming together

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
i think what i'm going to do is actually

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,000
give this

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,520
pride of place oh whoops sorry

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
part of place and then kick everyone off

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,039
the stream

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,360
yeah i wanted to keep our sound uh

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,880
yeah but it doesn't quite work

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,400
so that is really cool now what are some

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,080
of your plans

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,600
for maybe some of like a

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,000
wallpaper for maybe like 2110 or what

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,919
are some

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,280
of the things of what are what are

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,520
some what are some things you want to

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,360
play with in in the future for artwork

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:24,720
whether it's wallpapers or whether it's

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
any kind of anything else creative

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,240
charlotte do you want to do i'm i'm so

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,960
sorry i was waiting for roy

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,039
i think i think to um i think i'd like

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,280
to experiment with more colors and stuff

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,840
like that for example you know

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,880
having more variety in color and just

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
you know thinking of something

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,200
completely out of the books because

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
obviously

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
a neon sign design's been done before

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,840
obviously it's been done by

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,440
quite a few people so i don't know how i

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,280
would be able to do it but i'd like to

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,960
you know take it somewhere else like

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,799
something more abstract

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,520
quote unquote yeah

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,280
that sounds that that i think would be

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,240
and especially since there's just so

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,960
much

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,960
potential too um both with

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
go ahead you have any uh

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,919
do you have any ideas any inspirations

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,200
of things that you like or some more

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
abstract things that you might want to

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,320
try and uh

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,039
take inspiration from uh i have no idea

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
i kind of like do you know andy warhol

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,000
for example

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah that kind of poppy sort of stuff

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
okay so i'd like to try out something

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
like that

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,799
ubuntu i like it yes oh actually that

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,840
would be really cool

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,880
yeah yeah

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,679
right i don't know yeah fair enough and

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,480
that's

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,520
okay vector oh okay cool so one thing

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,679
that's

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,000
is the is this right about vector art is

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:05,200
that vector art can be scaled

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,200
whereas pixel art is kind of like

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:15,200
it scales and it goes weird

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,919
it thinks yeah pretty much to be honest

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
it's if if you if you because it's an

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,120
fspg

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,240
format if you if you scale it up a lot

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,799
then you'll be able to see the

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,600
definition in the lines however with

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,120
you know rasta based yeah if if you

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
scale it up eventually it will just

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
become

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,240
you know incomprehensible basically oh

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520
i am going to also kind of share this

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,240
here especially for the people on twitch

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,200
and this is from dwd who's one of the i

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,720
do believe one of the founders of the

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,520
hideo and he says that the ubuntu

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
ogo has undergone several iterations but

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
it's inspired by a community-made

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
wallpaper

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
found on the internet many years ago

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,240
which had a similar

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
paint splash awesome

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,360
yeah and it's just been really neat to

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,240
see all the

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
all the fun kind of things you all have

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
done like with some of the see

seasonal ones um i do believe you also

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,919

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,679
height out there and how involved like

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,960
with the things like the

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,640
endavas and the uh and now with the

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,159
community hours just

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,200
how excited that you all have been to

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,640
so it so it's been so it's been really

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
fun to hang out with all of

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
you and i'm excited about things that

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840
we'll get to do with

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,039
all of you in the future so it looks

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,320
like

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:29,120
rolly is kind of um

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,039
adding to this um adding to this here

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
to kind of show kind of how it

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,559
progresses through all of the different

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,360
cut colors and i feel bad because i

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,159
think

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,159
um zubuntu would be that darker blue

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,520
and then that and then that aqua is kind

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,320
of like the kubuntu

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,320
in studio i think

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:59,760
yeah that looks oh it is

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,600
interesting to see the ubuntu mate logo

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
on those different

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,520
with those different colors that we

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,960
associate with other flavors

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,960
so it just it looks cool but it just

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,000
feels like you're just like

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,880
so that means off so something's going

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,200
on here

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,799
yeah it's cool though yeah so

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,840
uh and so what and

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:30,000
this um oh heather had a really

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
good question back here

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
would it help the artists if they knew

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
the release name ahead of time while

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
they are designing

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
uh that's a super interesting question

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
charlotte would if would it help you

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,679
plan things and do things

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,679
uh yeah for sure because obviously if i

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,159
knew the release name i'd know what to

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,520
kind of

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,679
expect to make the artwork veeamed about

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,039
you know i mean as i said i'm very bad

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,320
at explaining stuff

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,320
however yeah i think

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,919
i think if i did know the release name

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,960
it would massively help

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,120
with color scheming and stuff

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,799
well obviously there's an ubuntu game

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,000
but there could be anything else if

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,600
you know anything could happen

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,120
okay and really how

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,159
it but how about you would having the

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,279
release name ahead of time kind of be a

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
yeah helpful thing

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,559
or or sit on

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,240
this see if we get a chat there

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,000
oh okay and early actually says

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,760
that the release names already get

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,360
revealed quite early

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,640
so and i think yeah and i think

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,640
if anything if artists are like any of

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,679
us who wait till the last

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,919
minute no matter how early we've got it

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,799
uh we get it we'd probably all be doing

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,159
it like the day

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:03,039
before anything was due so

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,440
i knew i did that a lot in school

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,120
yeah it's like oh it's like i have three

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
months to start on this and then it's

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,200
like nah

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,320
i don't have to so but and

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
oh i have an interesting question if uh

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,039
i know we've had

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,760
a lot of animals already

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,000
oh actually heather has a really good

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
one

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
how much freedom do the artists feel

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,200
like they have with the

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,520
color schemes as i said earlier i think

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,919
you know i think as i said i would like

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
to experiment with abstract art so i

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,880
think i have quite a bit of freedom to

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,159
make it you know

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,679
colorful yet you know informative and

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,960
you know stuck to the um actual

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,600
you know i mean yeah

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,320
so it's and it's interesting here to see

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,039
while you're talking about that to see

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,679
rolly screen with all the different

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,159
shades

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,520
and there's actually i know like for the

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,600
aubergine there's like

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:11,279
four official aubergines

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:16,080
really really yeah i get uh let's see

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:19,120
it's uh the ubuntu palette

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,640
will our design team will be

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,080
happy for the out

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,200
oh there you go is that is that them

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,080
there really

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,320
oh yeah nice i'm gonna assume so yeah

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
cool

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,279
i just put that in the chat so if you

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,320
ever wanted to like get things printed

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,520
you even have the official codes

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,919
so um and yeah we have oh yeah so we've

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,200
got

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,000
the three aubergines and then we have

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
the

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,640
canonical aubergine which then come in

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,159
all of their tints

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,679
so so there is even though it is those

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,279
two colors there's

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,279
it it seems like there's a bit of

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,240
flexibility with them

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,200
so rolly that's super handy too that you

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,919
have that all

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,919
built in and

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:20,480
rolly which program are you

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,480
using inkscape cool

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,120
which is one of the ones i have not

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,039
played with yet

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,520
oh yeah do you do any do you play with

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,559
any artist tools normally you wanna

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,880
i played a bit with creda because i did

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,039
get

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,240
a wacom tablet that has now been like

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,679
gathering dust for like

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,200
for like two months so um but also

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,360
unfortunately ubuntu mate is one of the

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,880
few flavors that doesn't work well with

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,320
the wacom stuff because

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,600
the drivers yeah um like it plugs

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,559
and and and plays but if you have two

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,080
monitors you have to kind of manually

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,399
tell it not to go

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,440
wait um yeah oh

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,640
and oh use credit for ester and

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,600
and um inkscape for vector

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,559
yeah and i yeah very cool um charlotte

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,200
what do you

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,559
uh what do uh i know you mentioned that

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,440
you started with

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,159
is that what you still mainly use uh i

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,720
currently use photoshop by adobe

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,559
the um reason for this is personally for

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,320
me i've always found it to be

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,799
you know a little bit easier for me to

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,159
use like interactively however

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,919
i think over the years like software

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
such as creta's gotten a bit

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
you know more user-friendly and it looks

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
a bit more

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
familiar to me so i might play around

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,960
with creator like eventually and maybe

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,440
even as well

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:53,039
awesome there are some pretty good um

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,000
youtube tutorials out there

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,640
and definitely would love to have more

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,760
artists

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,000
um who who kind of use this because yeah

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
this

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,360
is just it's funny because we use like

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,720
so many of the things that the creatives

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,159
in our community make

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,480
we use and don't think about all the

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,600
work and skill that goes into making

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,720
this stuff so uh

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,559
yes definitely and it's it's i agree

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
that it's uh i don't know anything about

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,480
all of this stuff either but

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,919
is it all sort of approachable kind of

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,880
can you get started with things like

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,760
inkscape in

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,640
critter image anything and critter is

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,000
good for art

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,679
okay that's super interesting but uh

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
uh charlotte would you recommend these

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,360
things it's just for people who want to

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,039
who want to learn or want to get going

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,279
or is there other tools for

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,760
more entry-level things um i think i

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,440
would recommend um krita ferrara as a

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
rollie said and for um image

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,600
editing mainly because i think the only

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,120
reason i'm not as used to them is

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,559
because i didn't grow up using them

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,720
however

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,240
definitely from what i've seen recently

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,360
they're very good and

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,840
very you know easy to pick up

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,120
at least so i would recommend definitely

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,559
i think they're really cool have have uh

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,399
have you tried the uh the

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,039
game snap package have you used the snap

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,039
for when you used

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,880
uh yeah i i think yeah i did use the

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,840
snap okay cool

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,840
just to satisfy down there you know

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,760
everything's good if dan is happy so

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,000
indeed

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,799
and using your snaps and that's good

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
because then

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,200
heather has studied those snaps so

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,480
that's great

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,760
so and so for um so

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,200
rolly for inkscape what's what do you

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,240
say uh what is the

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,919
primary difference or like primary use

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,640
case difference

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,640
between creda and inkscape then

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,279
you're on mute if you're speaking okay

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,360
oh sorry what's going to rolly yep

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,159
yep so oh okay so inkscape is made for

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,879
vector

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,119
okay so if you were thinking of doing

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,599
things like would this be things kind of

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:21,040
like

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:24,159
icons and stuff

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,679
oh inkscape is good for icons

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,000
cool which is always a way to

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,000
i think that's kind of a piece of art

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,679
that i certainly don't think about i

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,240
mean for art i tend to think of

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,320
wallpaper and things i don't think of

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,960
all the little icons that i use to

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,560
navigate between to show me what program

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,960
i'm in so it's um

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,599
but this is i think i want to put both

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,119
of these

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,760
comments up here so we fielded a

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,079
question in

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,119
in the community this week how to get a

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,000
first job

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,040
the theme of our re replies was largely

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,480
get some experience first however

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,160
however you can

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,400
and this i think is a really good point

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,240
for artists in our community

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,599
something like of their something like

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,240
the use of their artwork with

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,000
attribution would be a great help

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,839
to them so for things for things like

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,400
uh you guys's uh artworks

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,760
where do you um besides places like the

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,200
highlight where do you publish them so

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,160
they're accessible for people so that

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
people can

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,079
can can use them and attribute them in

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
the proper way or is that or is it more

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,079
of a personal

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,000
on your hard drive kind of thing um a

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,680
lot of most of my art is

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,839
you know personal on my hard drive

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,000
however i have been

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,040
thinking about making some kind of

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,119
website to

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,160
put these things on how i'm gonna

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,000
execute this i have no idea however

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,079
you know i've seen a little bit of um

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,760
i've seen a few art project websites

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
that are quite minimalistic yet

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,280
you know they're like little galleries

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,280
that will stay on there so

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,400
it's it's very it's a field that i kind

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,680
of want to see if i can get into

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
putting things that sounds that sounds

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,359
super i mean there are lots of obviously

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,599
there are lots of people in there

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,400
who have lots of uh experience with that

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,640
kind of

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,480
setup would you want to set up your own

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,920
uh server your own website and do

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,000
everything or would you prefer to have

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,200
maybe like some maybe like a wordpress

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,720
kind of thing

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,839
for your for your art where you put

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,359
things on there would you want to try

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,040
and do it all yourself

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,760
uh i'd love to do it all my all by

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,480
myself i know a little bit of html but

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,160
not nearly enough to you know make a

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,839
fully fledged website so it'd be a bit

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
more of a learning experience for me and

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,640
i've always been interested in

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
programming a little bit we're not

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,079
programming

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,079
you know you know what i mean

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,160
sorry no yeah carry on sorry yeah we

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,320
know what you mean yeah

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,160
yes so i and i think kind of having

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,359
places where i know because we have

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,680
in the desktop we have some people who

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,520
like

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,800
especially when we come up with the um

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,200
um when we post the official

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,560
artwork that we have people who have

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,680
created their own

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,520
and they'll add it to that post but it

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,359
would be neat to maybe have

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:21,440
a like maybe

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,079
to better promote a place where people

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,000
can kind of

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,680
share their desktops and maybe even have

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,280
like you know to

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,079
highlight that totally

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,359
yes let me just roll it back to what

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,560
rory said as well

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,280
so uh they put almost all of the stuff

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,160
on on an sd card but they also have a

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,599
website

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
which is uh really.neosites.org so

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,760
people can go over there and have a look

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
hopefully that would be super

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760
interesting

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,240
it's uh really is your work on that site

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
uh available for people to download is

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,200
it available for people to reuse that

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,560
kind of thing what sort of

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,000
licensing and attribution is there uh

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,079
and i'm presuming this gradient that's

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,040
on screen is the really iridescent

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,560
gradient super very nice this is how it

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
looks when you reuse the ingredients

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,599
awesome

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
i like that we put the mate logo on this

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,280
thing's face that's pretty cool

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,640
it does look very cool it looks like

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,640
some kind of

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,480
awesome robot bug i like like it

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,079
when i have more stuff i can i'm gonna

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,160
put it onto the website awesome

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,280
that's super interesting i mean i'll be

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,119
keeping my eye out this

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,320
just from the little demo wing that

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,000
you've been doing on the screen there

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,720
i'm super interested in

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,400
it's been really almost hypnotic to

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,599
watch in the background

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,680
just all these color cha changes and

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,480
it's so neat that it's things that

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:50,079
um do bug-tastic oh

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,079
dear oh

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,560
okay i'm really sad that i'm not on this

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,440
one with

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,560
my personal twitch because one of my

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,040
channels there's a

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,400
pun bomb emoji and i would so use that

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,440
for this so yeah

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,040
ah so anything um so is there anything

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,280
else that you

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,079
like you all would like to share like

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,040
any like anyone who's thinking about

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,119
kind of trying their hand with artwork

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,640
is there any advice that

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,640
you would give them

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,280
um is that a question for us all the

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
audience so it's a question for

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,280
that's the question for you all oh um i

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,200
apologize um i think the only advice i'd

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,880
really give is to not be afraid to you

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,920
know experiment

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,040
because obviously a lot of people have a

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,359
very

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,520
have a very focused image on what quote

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,160
unquote art is however

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,400
failed to you know realize that art is

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,119
highly subjective and there's different

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,079
variants of art and different styles so

00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,520
you should never be

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,760
like you know you should never let your

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,000
art style hold you back from

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,480
you know distributing art and you should

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,160
never let your skill hold you back

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,400
just you know just just distribute what

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,160
what what if you love to do it just dish

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,200
like you know just have fun with it

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,400
really yeah with it experiment and

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,000
really here says

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
uh the only way to improve with that is

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,960
just to make more art

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,040
i think that goes for a lot of things

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,599
right that follows the practice

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,119
practice makes perfect mantras that um

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,560
and that i've heard lots of different

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,800
artists of different kinds whether

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,960
that's uh visual

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,000
or otherwise people say the same thing

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
right if you want to improve on

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,680
something

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:45,680
do that thing exactly

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,680
yep just get stuck in and oh

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,160
and this is i think a great parallel to

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,839
a lot of things in our community as dan

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,520
has

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,200
posted and what's really what's really

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,480
lovely about all of this especially with

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,160
programming and with

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,640
a little bit about and with things like

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,760
website uh creation and design and

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,880
setting all that kind of thing up i

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,760
think there's lots of people in the

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,119
ubuntu community who are always happy to

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,119
to help and share that knowledge and

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,359
help people get stuck in

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,960
so that they can do that practicing and

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,400
do that over and over again in

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,480
in the way that they like which is super

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,359
great

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,079
and we have another question from

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,319
heather

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,160
so rolly and ch charlotte are you a part

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,200
of any other open source projects

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,560
besides

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,880
ubuntu i am not currently um

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,560
i would love to you know get you know

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,359
get involved with it a bit more

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,480
but not currently is my only answer

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,960
really

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:44,160
okay so basically not yet not yet

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,160
that's a better way of putting it

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,160
not yet yeah really releases the same

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,240
then not

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,200
yet which is i think i think which i

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,800
think is a

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,400
um i think that's a pretty common thing

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
with ubuntu people find ubuntu and they

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,200
get interested in open source

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,119
and then they learn on other things and

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,359
i think that's a really good uh

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,599
thing i think that says a lot about

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,119
changes but it's mostly

00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:03,440

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,920
what july

two years since we've had this

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,240

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,480
after seeing

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,559
inspired they are

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:05,839
what our community makes and what

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,359

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,839
there's a link in the discourse post to

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,280
the eu i don't mind one so if anyone

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,480
wants any inspiration or they want to

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,440
see what's happened before

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,200
you'll be able to go and see the

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,319
previous discourse post and since omg

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,079
ubuntu is here

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,599
uh they've got they've had they had a

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,920
nice write up for every single one of

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
the

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,280
i'm pretty sure every single one of the

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,480
wallpaper contests that have come before

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,599
so i'm sure you could poke around and

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,359
search for them if you're looking for

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,000
something

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,960
but it's very exciting yeah and so this

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,359
is just

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,000
this is we hope the first of many more

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,200
to come

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,079
we really think this is a great way to

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,079

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,240
to get the community involved in the

00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,119
releases

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,880
and we're really excited about this

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,760
until it comes time to vote and then

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,240
it's going to be

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,760
really really really hard to pick our

00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,119
favorites

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,119
it's okay we don't do a lot of the

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,920
