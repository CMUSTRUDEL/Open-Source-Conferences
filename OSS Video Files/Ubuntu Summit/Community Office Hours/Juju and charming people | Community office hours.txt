really cool so yeah so a bit of a

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,200
personal story in the

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
but it's also community news which is

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,920
awesome

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
absolutely canadian news friends of the

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,840
friends of the show that's what it is

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
um oh my god totally friends of the show

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,640
yeah

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
um and other things that have been going

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
on there's been more conversation around

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
the state of the sort of

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,480
wider ubuntu documentation ecosystem

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,480
which has been

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
going on a little bit it's getting a bit

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
huge as we expected

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
because it's it's quite a large problem

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,680
that everyone's aware of and

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
it's something that i think we're gonna

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,720
start carving some time out for to

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
address properly and to start

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
getting things in place so hopefully

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
we'll be able to contribute more to that

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,519
discussion soon

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
and our friends over at ubu khan asia

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,720
have

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,239
pushed their extended the deadline for

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,640
cfps so if anyone

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
is wanting to present or talk a little

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
bit at

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,480
ubuntu you've still got time to do it

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
they they didn't they said they didn't

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
quite get enough people to submitting

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
yet so

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
fill their roster it'll be a good time

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
yeah

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,840
and it just seems like they would be a

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,480
really great like especially

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
if you're kind of new and you were and

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
you've been like

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
well maybe i want to submit a talk oh

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
especially if you're in this time zone

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,599
so

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
this would be because that's you know

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,400
that's

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
you you don't have to be up stupid early

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
or stupid late

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,400
and it would just be a great thing to do

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,440
and you're and they're just

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,720
such energetic and excited people

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,600
about about ubuntu and open source

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,680
that if you haven't submitted a talk and

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
you've got something in mind just put a

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,720
proposal together

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,960
and just put it out there and

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
trust me um speaking at these kind of

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
events

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
from i mean this was previous life but

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
they

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
is kind of once you start presenting i

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,960
think it's kind of hard to stop

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
so i think this would be a really great

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
one to start with

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
oh i think so go back to because it's uh

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
they say

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
obviously it's it's ubiquinone asia so

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
there's lots of

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
there might be some language things but

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
they were saying when we had them on the

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
stream a couple of weeks ago

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,840
that everything can be in english and

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
everyone has a decent grasp of english

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
and so

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
anyone can give the presentations and

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,600
it'll be super cool

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,759
yeah so definitely put in your

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,919

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,199
let's say i've been at i've been at

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,680
canonical for now almost two years

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
um and i think before that uh the big

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
theme

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,639
of what i do is is essentially

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
establishing equity in communities um so

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,400
i started out doing that

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
with healthcare and then i moved into

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
improving access to education

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
and then i was like ah why stop there

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,440
let's do it with all the things

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,639
in tech and so over the past two years

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
been doing crazy

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
crazy stuff like bringing linux

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,720
more profoundly into the automotive

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,319
industry to really propel

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
innovation and things that are going on

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,520
there and then to all those poor

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,080
unfortunate souls that are stuck with

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,919
windows i've been bringing you linux

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
through the windows subsystem for linux

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
um

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
and a couple of other things like that

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,160
now i'm working on a thing called juju

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,680
and charms and uh

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,639

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,759
and on all the aspects of the

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,960
project life cycle from the very

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,960
beginning of the architecture to

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,759
interacting with the community and and

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,319
and getting some feedback

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,680
but i've been using and loving open

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,599
without an operational system and

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
i didn't have money to buy windows

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
that's that's the first time that i

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,919
interact

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,360
yeah yeah i i didn't stop

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,759
things i i i love it i love being

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,440
around people that are passionate about

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,400
making great quality software

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,199
available to anyone awesome that's

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
really great

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,680
so uh as you viewers i would have heard

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,599
that both of these people

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,599
but pedro and tahini are canonical

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,280
people but uh for this

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,720
particular stream we're gonna we're

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
taking canonical hats off because

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,280
obviously

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,720
monica and i also can argue people and

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
we're putting on our community

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
booty person hats to talk about things

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,120
uh personally so nothing

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
said here necessarily like salinas is

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,039
very well fitted that's good

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
um so everything here is we're talking

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
about things from another

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,599
from a community perspective as

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,840
contributors um

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,440
from that perspective um so before we

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,720
get into juju stuff i'd like to just ask

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
you guys a couple of questions about

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,759
ubuntu

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
community related things um you touched

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
on them both touched on a little bit

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
here but

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,399
uh i wonder where did you begin with

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
ubuntu can you tell us a little bit

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,200
about what you've

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,800
sort of been involved in ubuntu

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
community-wise so far

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
and pedro why don't you think of

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,880
assistant yes

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,680
sure um so outside of canada i think

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800
uh i've been involved in several

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
projects mainly

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,519
fao which is disk benchmarking tool

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,080
and cool it was incorporated into

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
this editor and i'm going to a couple of

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
years ago

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
uh but i really liked the project and

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
the people

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,240
that worked well i'm not such an expert

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
in disk benchmarking but

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
the community is really welcoming and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,519
and the bugs for

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
beginners are quite challenging and

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
rewarding so i like

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
spending some time there um and at

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,480
canonical

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,519
i am trying to understand a bit of

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,640
who is the juju community and uh

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,800
how we can uh provide

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
better tools and gather some feedback

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,399
from from the community and

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,760
work with them to

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,360
to to to work and to make to do a

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
truly and genuine community driven

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,920
project

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,120
and and and i'm working as some sort of

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
community manager or advocate for juju

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
at the moment

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
interesting so something we've asked a

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,519
bunch of other guests obviously that i

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
think you'll have a good answer for

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
is what was your first uh ubuntu

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,959
distribution what was the first

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,399
version or release that you used

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,000
do you remember in 2006 now i can't

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,519
remember if it was

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
04 or 10 or if it was that weird year

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
that

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
that there was some or something like

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,440
that but

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,880
it was 2006 and or

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
anyways but i remember that i didn't

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,399
have my internet was not good

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
it would take like weeks for me to

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
used one download those programs that

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,680
canonical had for

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,720
um for sending the cds yes

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,279
the ship it program yeah

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:49,120
and i love that so much because

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,279
uh it's recognizing that not everyone

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
has access to like quick fast internet

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,320
by the time like 15 years ago not

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,440
everyone would have like broadband or

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,560
even broadband so um

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
recognizing that and and and and sending

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
that

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
and growing the community through uh

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
mail

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
that's something quite amazing and and

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,360
that was the distribution i used i still

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
keep the city as a

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,560
i'm kind of sad you didn't bring it

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
because there's inevitably the point in

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,920
any of these where people start playing

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,160
who has the oldest linux stuff

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
and you know people are pulling out like

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,880
their floppy disks

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
and things like that so that is

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
very cool and it's just it's it's great

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,079
it's such a common theme of how many

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
people got

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
into it because you know they couldn't

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
afford

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
you know like because windows was

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
expensive

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
and you had the means where the disc

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
could

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
you could go onto the website and just

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
order it or go to

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,720
a loco and they would have them there

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,600
or you would get them in like the linux

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
magazine

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,399
and things like like that so it was

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,480
interesting now because where

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
especially for those of us who have good

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
internet and we

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,079
don't you know we might not think about

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,880
you know

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,320
downloading the isis but unfortunately

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,200
even 15 years

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,880
later that's not that's still not true

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
for everybody

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,120
and so i think that there's still an

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,160
important place for those you know

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,079
having easy access to it

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,639
and one thing curious about ordering

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,320
these cities from brazil is that um

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,800
the customs is quite

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
uh complicated it's very hard to import

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
things

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
from ao so you had you had this forums

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
when people would be like

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,480
oh my god they got the cd it finally got

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
like one

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
100 of the people get the cd before the

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
next release so

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,480
this person making copies because of

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,519
course that's the year with the law yeah

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,920
and and then one one person would buy

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
this

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,480
bulk uh pie of cds and the other one

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,360
so it was a cool cool times fun times

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
that's very cool yeah very cool uh what

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
about you

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
where did you begin with the video or

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
tell us a bit more about maybe a bit

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
more about

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
your contribution with wsl community

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
stuff

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,920
oh man my story is not as cool but i

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,519
will say um

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,440
i learned about linux in general in

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
college which kind of upsets me because

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
it feels like i had a really

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
really i don't know maybe i wasn't

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,880
adventurous enough um

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,399
as a kid but uh the linux labs were like

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
really dark and scary

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,440
in college they were like really smelly

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
and i just

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
you know i avoided it at first but then

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
i started doing this like robotics

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
challenge

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,959
yes reese my first project was actually

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,279
with robotics

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
so i like to hear yeah and it kind of

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
felt like cheating

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
right because it's like a it's it's a

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
contest for for

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
having your robot go through this maze

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
and i remember just learning from

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,240
from the community and grabbing things

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
from the community and

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,079
it was kind of funny i don't i think my

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,160
version was a saucy salamander

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,079
i think that was the first one i think

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,519
so i remember the name

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,000
um but yeah it was it was a good time

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
um and haven't turned back since from

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
from wsl wsl

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,519
started in like well technically 2015

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,920
um but didn't really get into it until a

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
couple years later so it was 2018 when i

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
first

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,480
was like ah this is cool

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
i don't have to go to the weird lab to

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,800
do

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,120
what i want to do and that was pretty

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,199
exciting

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,399
super easy saucy sat had completely

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,959
forgotten that i think that's such a

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,760
good

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,320
code now i think that was 13 think that

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
was three

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
ten that's not i didn't know that that's

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
very cool

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,440
that that is a really um

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,639
awesome story and i think that it's it's

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
one of those things about

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
community learning and for you know so

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,880
many times we talk

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
you know it's kind of like we have this

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,120
divide between either

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,279
university taught or self-taught but i

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
think there's this middle ground between

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
community taught where it's like

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,760
learning as

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,800
this collaborative thing

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,040
and it's honestly i think that's

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,399
the most fun and especially now where

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,440
these kind of streams are so easy to do

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,639
and we just see people kind of um like

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
people doing like

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
debbie and packaging and you know which

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
is

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,560
maybe nothing i'm sure five year like me

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
from five years ago it's like you're

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,800
watching a stream

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,279
on what now so but it's just

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,519
like you watch it and you see especially

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
you like people talking through it

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,000
and you see it's like okay this is how

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,320
they do it and it demystifies stuff but

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,920
it also kind of like inspires you

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,959
to be like i could maybe try this

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,279
and it's just it's it's i think

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,160
one of the coolest things that our

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,680
community

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,040
and others like it do and

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,720
one thing that you said that is very

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,399
interesting is when these two

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,440
universes merge so when the university

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,320
and the community learning uh

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,040
they kind of merge because uh the

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
university allows you to have this this

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,959
physical interaction this presence is

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,800
face to face and the community

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,360
sometimes we like that because of

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,720
distances and and and so on

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,639
so many many times we had such cool

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,199
events at the universities that

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,920
at the uni that were organized primarily

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,959
online

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,240
and then they were they transcended

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,240
the online role too

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,079
also let's be honest those events were

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,120
great ways to get

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,720
free food oh yeah

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,040
we fruit and free t-shirts that's what

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,279
you're there for

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,839
and stickers possibly nothing's changed

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,319
i think those are still my highest

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,959
priorities think

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
it's interesting that you um that you

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
say all of that though because it's

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,839
it's one of those things that because of

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
the lack of well not necessarily lack of

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
but because of the decline of sort of

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,520
locos and local community groups and

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
meetups and stuff

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
it's been a real shame because that's

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,120
where a lot of people sort of found

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,039
their start

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,559
and got going with things yeah

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,240
yeah what's been interesting is that

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,799
some like even though

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
they've declined in some places in other

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,840
places they're still like

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,120
obviously like the uh the

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
like the uber con latin america um

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,360
community

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,480
super vibrant um portugal

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
car rhea and so places where they've

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
stayed

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,520
active or that have like that they

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,360
became active

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:59,120
as maybe some of like the american and

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,520
um european and other european ones kind

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
of

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
started to go down is like things

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,919
changed

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,880
um it's been interesting to see

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,679
like some you know these people who are

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
still

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:17,360
keeping that local get-together spirit

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,559
going and so i know that actually the

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,039
loco research group

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,960
is i think they're just just over

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,200
halfway through their process

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
about finding ways to how in 2021

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,720
do we kind of learn from the ones that

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
are active and maybe kind of

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480
start to revitalize this part of our

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
community which yeah

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
so once we can like be doing things in

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
public oh my gosh i want to get together

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
with people and

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,200
nerd out about this stuff and get new

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,400
people into our community

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,640
so yeah totally

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
speaking of new people in communities

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
it's not a very good segue but we'll

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,559
talk about juju now

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,880
so um

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,760
so if you came here looking at the title

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
that's because we want to talk about

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,880
youtube we have

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,360
to hear two very to juju involved people

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
and so to the to the crowd to the both

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,679
of you and

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
first of all from people who don't

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
listen because i don't think i don't

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
think

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
people please correct me if i'm wrong

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,919
that our usual listeners are terribly

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,200
diehard juju fans

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,480
please what is

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,320
eric's there we know eric oh there you

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,799
go

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,400
yeah uh maybe i can start with juju as a

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,480
host oh and then we can talk about the

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,000
trump collection

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,120
so juju is a charm operator life cycle

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
manager

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,559
i think that explains everything it's

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
really close yeah that's it

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,919
see you guys okay put it all down it's

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,840
all good no i

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
i promise it's really simple so if you

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,000
break it down what it means

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,160
a charm is just a word to specify that

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
is one kind of operator an operator

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
is an operator something that operates

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,880
something and

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
um and life cycle manager

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
is just we're gonna care about the whole

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,600
life cycle

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
of something so uh what we are actually

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
doing

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,280
is automating uh the lifecycle

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,159
management

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,280
of a piece of software and why is that

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
important why do you

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
even need to care about life cycle isn't

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,840
it just a matter of like

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
double clicking the thing installing the

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
snap and and and

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
you have the software well it is for

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,320
your local system usually

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,559
but when you're talking about cloud

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,640
infrastructure and distributed systems

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,360
and and hybrid clouds and multi clouds

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,440
and

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,960
and all these sort of things it gets a

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,440
bit more complicated because you need to

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,840
care about how scalable your system is

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
how

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,919
secure your system is how much it

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
complies with standards

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,360
so when you start adding this kind of

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,360
complexity

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,640
each stage of the life cycle of

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,320
your application gets a bit more complex

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,159
than just double clicking installing

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
thing so when you

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,200
first choose your application it's

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
already a challenge because you need to

00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,679
know

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,039
that this application will be compatible

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,360
with my

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,200
underlying infrastructure and it will be

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
compatible with other applications and

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,559
and it will deliver what the customer

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,159
wants and then when i

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
actually install my application i need

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,760
to care that

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,159
the application will react well to the

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,640
environment and to the to the usage

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,480
and so on when i start integrating my

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,320
applications when i want my database to

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,320
talk with my front end

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,480
that that's also complete so you see

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,400
that i could spend like hours and hours

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
talking about challenges that devops

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
face

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,880
on a daily basis too it sounds like an

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,880
idea for more content

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,200
absolutely and and that's one of the

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,080
things that that

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
that are the highlights of juju right so

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,039
juju is trying to

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,320
make a very uh stress

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,320
less very str

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
take a little bit of your energy from

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,159
stressing so much about complying to the

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,039
best standards

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
to focusing on uh what kind of

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,600
applications or

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,120
what what what you want to deliver at

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
higher level right so it's a set of

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,320
tools pretty much

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
just a set of tools to care about the

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,919
life cycle of your applications

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,960
and um oh yeah

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,000
and uh it is

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,440
um and that's

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
what's very so interesting for for

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,960
devops right but uh

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
there is the whole um community side of

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
juju that i think could be more

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,919
interesting for this

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,520
for this forum and that's what sohini is

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,000
a specialist

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:42,080
oh specialist

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
man that's going on my resume pedro said

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,120
it

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,520
we uh we do archive these videos so

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,320
just saying we we could give you a time

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
stamp

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,080
and you don't just put that i'll give

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,080
you a frame of my face

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,320
as said by pedro oh my gosh excellent um

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,480
we'll put a little brand store certified

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,440
that's excellent um

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
well so the the charm collection should

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
i go into

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,679
you spoke a bit about what a charm is

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
but um

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
so i've been watching a lot of rick and

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
morty i don't know if you guys are if

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,960
you're

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
watching a little bit of it but i don't

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
know if you're familiar with the the

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
concept of mind blowers but the way i

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
think about charms is

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,240
you know during this pandemic period you

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,600
know people are getting really

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
every now and then an engineer will go

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
on a rabbit hole and understand

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
everything there is to know about maybe

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
an

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,559
endpoint relation of of how an

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,880
application should speak to another

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,720
application or you know how a um

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
you know how what's every time you back

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,520
up a certain application you need to

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
make sure you do all these different

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,360
things

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,039
um and and if all of those different

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
little tidbits of information then all

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
these different engineers

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,120
were learning throughout their time in

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
lockdown and in a basement with no

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,000
windows for

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
a year and a half if all that was

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
essentially like extracted out like rick

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
and morty style and put

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,440
into one big thing that would be a charm

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
right so all the instructions all the

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,679
things you need to know little itty

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
bitty

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,279
weird goodness that you need to know

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,880
about all the

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,120
you know how to handle chaos how to

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
handle all these different environments

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,360
if all that information was distilled

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,200
into code about how to deploy

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,400
an application configuring it managing

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
the full life cycle

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
how it should relate how it should speak

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,080
to a different application

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
that would essentially be a charm and

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,919
through the charm collection

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,720
we've got all these different charms

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,480
that some

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
people at canonical build based on their

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,120
best practices after deploying managing

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
the life cycle of these applications for

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,080
our clients for many many years

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,679
all of that distilled knowledge goes

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
into that charm

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,039
and then also with our community so

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
people like eric so all the things that

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
he's learned with

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,919
many many years of deploying and working

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
in complex environments all the things

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
that he's learned

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,919
gets put into a charm and so that that

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,640
knowledge is then something that can be

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,360
shared

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,440
and distributed and that is a beautiful

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,480
elegant wonderful solution

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,919
that that takes the complexity the

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,799
stress the anxiety

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,720
the insanity out of the the nuances of

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,520
deploying managing things and hopefully

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
with a vision

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,360
of of automating into the future and

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
having a collection of all these

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
applications

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,520
you then begin to think about okay how

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,960
should they work together

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,520
every time i want to deploy a full stack

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,360
of logging monitoring and alerting i use

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,880
these four charms together and then i

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,159
get all of those different services

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
together and i know it's just going to

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
work

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,080
so that's the vision of a charm a charm

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,880
collection how they all work together

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,840
and hopefully that made sense and

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
everyone thinks about rick and morty

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
that makes sense so you've got you've

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,559
got the charms these distilled best

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
practices

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,600
information about managing applications

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
you've got the childhood where all of

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
that lives

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,640
the juju that sort of goes in between

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,720
these things and the vision you said

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
is uh is automating automating all of

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,320
these tasks and whatever

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,840
but is there uh what else does that work

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
so we've got what is youtube but why

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,200
youtube what's the

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,039
what's the why here uh if i'm

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,190
any i think i think there are pretty

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,720
much two good answers for that so

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,679
[Music]

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,720
okay don't let my boss hear that the

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,039
boring one is that

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,000
it's very good for it's excellent for

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,640
devops

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,320
so uh if you need to comply to set of

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
standards if you do not want to spend

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,799
too much time

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,919
uh with uh integration of applications

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,720
if you do not

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,240
know how to do things you can just do

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
four or five commands and you're gonna

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,200
have a full stack of kubernetes

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,200
uh cluster of kubernetes running uh

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,679
as good as you'd have if you had hired a

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,360
consultancy firm or something

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
uh so that's one of the answers right

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,000
and and there are lots of

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,520
nothing in that sense

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,559
but the thing that i really like is that

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,320
um anyone can deploy an application and

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,520
use an application

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,720
uh on a cloud cloud native space

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,799
so if you think about uh someone that

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
had an idea of an algorithm

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
in this person i don't know it's a

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
specialist in agronomy and they had an

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,679
idea of how to measure nitrogen in the

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
crops

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,679
that's they're not necessarily special

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,679
devops specialists

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,480
but they have this amazing idea that

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,000
runs locally on their computer

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,559
but doesn't scale so the value of the

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,600
thing

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,360
at a global level it's it's it's

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,039
unfortunately decreased because the

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,399
person who have to you know run

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,320
everything in their own system it

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,919
doesn't scale it's not real

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,760
so why does why why wouldn't something

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,720
let that scale what's the current issue

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,880
there

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
it's just running locally right to

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
that's the difference between running

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,919
locally just for yourself and actually

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,360
building a

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,279
service for others right and

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,799
the magic of juju for me is that

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,240
these people who had great ideas of

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,679
uh that can can make a real difference

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,919
they do not need to be devops

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,480
specialists and no need to spend

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
years and years and years researching to

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,559
know how to deploy their applications

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,399
because honestly that's a boring part

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,559
that's the cool part is right here where

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,240
your application and and you're making

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,919
difference and that's impactful

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,840
bit the whole everything else under

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,120
under your application is just

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,559
infrastructure

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,919
and what we are what you do

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,760
is allowing is anyone

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,760
with knowledge on how to do something

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
amazing to

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,559
offer that amazing thing at a global

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,760
level so if you know if you spend i

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
don't know i don't give

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,600
numbers here but if you spend you know a

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,200
week or two researching a bit

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,960
on on your cloud of your cloud of

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,600
preference plus juju

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,840
you probably can apply i don't know a

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,159
python application to at a global scale

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,840
and

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,960
that that you know will actually

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,360
do something amazing you know

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,760
from and we're changing it

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
it's allowing this person to now offer

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,120
this to to many more people

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,919
and and that's what i like so much about

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,919
juju it's it's

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,679
making it available to to everyone out

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,640
there

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,000
that's the magic of it i would say

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
that's the magic of it cool

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,360
cool see you do you have anything do you

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,120
have anything why juju

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,120
how do you how do you top that i mean

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,320
when it when it comes to charms i don't

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
know where i got this idea but i think

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
it was one of those late nights just

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,360
playing around thinking about it

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,360
listening to music and then like

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,640
of course baxter boys came on and it was

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,080
i don't care who you are

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,080
where you're from what you did as long

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,120
as you love me right that's how i think

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
a charm is

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,840
like i don't care if you're on whatever

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,440
cloud you're on you're on kubernetes

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
you're not on kubernetes

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,480
if you're on this insane old

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
hybrid cloud structure that you're in

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
your institution has kind of put

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,279
together

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,480
you know ad hoc or if you're perfectly

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,000
designed

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,000
you know as long as you love the the

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,720
application as long as you've put the

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
time in

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,520
and and you know enough community

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,760
members have gotten together and

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,039
shared their insights and information

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,200
into that charm

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,720
um the charm is gonna be a beautiful

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,720
wonderful thing and it'll love you

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,799
forever and i think that that's

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
you know that's that's that's my opinion

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,000
about about

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
white charts that it's it's really

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,039
agnostic for

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,399
for whatever background you want and i

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,320
think also for like

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,760
whatever tools that you use like people

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,200
talk about what's the difference between

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
ansible and terraform

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
and puppet and chef and all that stuff

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,720
and i'm like we'll bring them

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,360
you know like if you've spent years of

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,200
your life

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,120
putting configuration management into

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
puffit chef ansible

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,519
you know bring those bring that insights

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,720
and information and transform it into

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,679
something that's central

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,440
and and can help you know teams who one

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,960
worked with puppet one work with chef

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,000
it's a it's a mechanism for

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,240
for those to still communicate um

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,840
and i think that's that's that's my why

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,840
charms on top of the why juju

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,880
so yeah and that's so important because

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,039
things are

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,960
i know for somebody who might be kind of

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,000
new to all of this

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,480
that there's so many potential

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,039
ways that they could go and i think it's

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,399
a bit

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,120
of decision paralysis there

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,200
but having something that can kind of

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,200
bring those choices together

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,480
and even though i both kind of love and

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,840
hate you right now for getting a

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,799
backstreet boys song

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,440
stuck in my head i think that was just

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,760
that was

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,799
a really beautiful kind of explanation

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,760
of not only how charms work but

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,039
why they're really awesome and i think

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,080
that one thing

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,600
that one of um one of our

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,880
viewers pointed out that this is

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,480
all new to me all completely new

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,039
and i totally agree with vince that

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,760
for somebody who is a total newbie to

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,799
all of this

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,440
you both are so good at

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,360
explaining not only what it is but why

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,720
but why it's important and i think

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,360
that's something that

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,880
sometimes gets lost it's like here's

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,360
what this does and it

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,039
you know it's like and it updates this

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
and it's the fastest this and it's like

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,799
but

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,559
why why does that matter and one thing

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,960
that i love about charms and

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,279
just recapping the charm is then this

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,480
disrupter we put around any application

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,000
out there to

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,760
make due to talk to the application

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,640
properly so the one thing that i love

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,720
about charms

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,360
is that don't tell my boss again

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,480
but nine percent of my encoding i am on

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,760
stack overflow or googling questions and

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,360
uh and copying and pasting is something

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,960
that i do very intensively

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,080
uh for for prototyping and this

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,200
and and uh

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,440
the thing here is that using a charm

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,799
or where we went together with charm and

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,159
the charming community

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,440
is as if a charm incorporated

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,919
the top 10 answers on stock overflow for

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,519
solving problems for an application

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,360
so imagine that you didn't have to

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,360
research 10 posts

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,760
for each problem that you had and two so

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,760
that imagine that

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,279
the application came with the best

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,000
practices as well

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,919
or when imagine what you need to do when

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,720
you're deploying a cloud application

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
maybe maybe

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,399
some some of the listeners never had to

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,080
do that but imagine doing something very

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,960
complicated that you had to research

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,519
on google how to do now imagine that

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,320
when you

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,760
downloaded the the application on

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,600
whatever format

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,640
it came with instructions on how to

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,559
debug it throughout the whole life cycle

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,399
and that's where i find it so amazing

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,440
and and what we're trying to achieve

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
here

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,760
in terms of community is that we do not

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,359
have one person

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,040
that is a specialist that answers all

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,440
these questions and stuck overflow we do

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,679
not have

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,040
one well maybe you have like some

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,159
applications that have just one person

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,320
but

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,200
maybe even that is not the most reliable

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,399
thing ever

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,679
we want eyes on

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,079
hundreds of eyes in one location we want

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,040
a whole community always making sure

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,240
that

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,040
our answers are of the best quality and

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,599
and optimal for that application and

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,320
that's where we went together we went

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,440
uh not one person per charm we want

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,639
dozens of

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,560
people um working on charm

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
and making sure that this this charm

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,359
works well so

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
when i go there and i use the charm i'm

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,760
actually using the know-how of

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,119
all these dozens of people and that's a

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,839
very cool vision but

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,839
also a challenge right because yeah

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,680
it's a very sort of it's a very sort of

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,040
ubuntu story it's the same it's a

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
similar kind of story that appears you

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,359
followed and snapcraft and all this kind

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,400
of thing

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,599
yeah just quickly um in the chat there i

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,040
saw a question about where they could

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
where you can find quick start

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,079
videos and promo video tutorials and

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,000
stuff for juju and

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
um that will be in the description for

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,960
people who aren't watching live

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,320
and we'll talk about that in a second

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,040
but before we talk about

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,960
how people can get into juju since we

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,040
brought up that sort of parallel to how

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,480
to ubuntu that's it being a very sort of

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,400
similar ubuntu

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,920
uh thing i know you were both relatively

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,880
recent to the juicy stuff but i wonder

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
if you could tell

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,160
a little bit of the story from the

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,480
beginning of juju when it was sort of

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
when it was sort of started and to to

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
where it is now

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,160
if you if you know that story i don't

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,160
know

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,200
they got big because i think our ceo

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,560
and our cto dreamt it up like a decade

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,599
ago

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,440
so so this this concept the

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,440
the the philosophies that that create

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,560
you know juju that drive juju there are

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,800
things that were were

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,839
drummed up a really long time ago that

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,359
are still more

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,119
i mean quite frankly now more prevalent

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,680
than ever or more important than ever

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,400
so i think pedro did you you wrote the

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,400
the history of

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,359
juju

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,480
i can give i can do some so australia in

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,680
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,280
so uh but the thing is that started

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,119
did you it's a very dynamic project and

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,960
the beauty of it is that we always be

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,119
dynamic you cannot put a pin and say

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,720
that's what you do support those are the

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,119
the clouds that you do support forever

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,640
it always a cumulative thing so it

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,000
started in 2009 as

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,880
as an idea to to deploy

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,560
applications in a consistent way but you

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,760
didn't have kubernetes by then

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,160
and you barely had the beginnings of

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,599
this universe of clouds the public

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,720
clouds that we have

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,320
and as the time passed and this new

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
technologies appeared you just started

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,520
incorporating these things

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,800
and uh i think that dude started and

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,920
in the 10 years drew up to be

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,079
this awesome project that has

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,400
incorporated so many apis underneath it

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,359
i can talk to so many clouds

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,359
but it's the same thing it's just one

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,000
core thing that talks to your

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,599
substrate your underlying infrastructure

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,480
and allows you to deploy applications on

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,560
top

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,880
so um although in this 10 years

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,960
there were a lot of architecture changes

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,680
and the way that your charm applications

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,280
change

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,560
the the the car due to change

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,119
the idea behind is the same kept the

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,440
same

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,040
and rhys are talking about ubuntu and

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,800
there's a very cool parallel to do

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,160
between juju and ubuntu so if you

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,520
think about someone that is getting to

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,040
the

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,079
linux universe um i don't know 15 years

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,720
ago

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,920
uh that was a very gray universe very

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,839
boring universe

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,280
from perspective of someone who wasn't

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,760
you know

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,040
someone that just wanted to use it out

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,119
of the box

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,880
uh maybe some fella don't offend any

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,119
developers out there that loved this

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,119
great world but uh my perspective of a

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,480
teenager they just wanted to play videos

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,200
and and

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,760
arduino from time to time it was really

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,359
complicated and hard to install a driver

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,720
and and make it work with with your

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,440
network card for example and ubuntu

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,520
brought it out of the box you you just

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,359
install the cd and it will ask you hey

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,119
do you install the drivers you install

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,920
the mp3 players

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,560
and you get a system working out of the

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,079
box

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,240
and i think that juju is kind of like

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,800
the cloud equivalent to that if you

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,520
think community wise or enabling and

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,960
empowering the community wise because

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,280
until well it's too it's not like it's

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
not

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,440
perfect but the idea is that

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,560
anyone would just take the system will

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,599
take you to this tool

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,119
and and build a system uh that will work

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,800
out of the box that will you have the

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,359
whole stack working for you you do not

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,720
need to

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,000
to deal about the uh oh this this driver

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,960
this this this

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,240
firewall role this uh integration

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,839
between these two applications too

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,960
complicated no we can just

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,800
focus on the top application layer and

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,160
again that's very powerful if you start

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,280
to think about it because imagine how

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,240
many people

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,599
gave up uh and again i'm i'm talking

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,040
about the average people that were

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,640
around me i'm not talking about

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,920
everyone but imagine how many people

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,720
gave up linux because it was too

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,960
complicated

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,839
now imagine how many people how many

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,760
people are giving up call native

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,320
applications because

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,359
it's too intimidating at the beginning

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,760
so that's that's

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,480
i think from my point of view canonical

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
hat off

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,880
that's what juju is trying to do

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,880
that's you

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,440
okay that's i'm trying to keep track of

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,560
my invisible hats and for sahidi and i

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,200
way too early to be doing that but

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:31,359
i just love that philosophy that

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,680
uh not only it's so egalitarian but it's

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,200
so

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,880
equitable you know taking people who

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,079
have great ideas and for juju like great

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,359
ideas that if they could be introduced

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,640
and supported at scale could really

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,440
change things

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,680
but instead of getting lost in you know

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,200
i

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,960
we've all been there when we've been

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,440
working on something

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,680
and four hours later we're still in the

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,359
weeds trying to get that to

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,359
work and how

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,480
i mean just how kind of life changing

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,079
that is

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,599
to have something where

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
that that hurdle is just kind of brought

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,520
down

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,800
or it's brought up from like here to

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,839
something that is that is easier for

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,400
people to

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,960
overcome and i think that's great

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,760
because

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,000
you know there is i think in some

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,319
aspects of the broader linux

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,560
community kind of uh well it was

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,920
super hard for me so it should be super

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,920
hard for everybody

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,839
and it's like well then we complain

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,640
about like our

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,480
market share and it's like because of

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,040
people feel that it's

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,680
hard and challenging and they can't get

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,800
help

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,960
and i love that our community ethos

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,079
from the very start has been like well

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,359
let's

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,280
no that's you know let's flip that on

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,240
its head and make this accessible to

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,440
everybody

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,079
and so pedro would you talk about

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
uh juju having that same philosophical

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,960
core

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,599
i think that certainly for most people

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,720
watching

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,480
this that you know we

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,599
we kind of feel that because that's i

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,280
think what drew us all to ubuntu in the

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,040
first place

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,880
no matter where we came in on

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,800
that's true and there's a whole aspect

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,400
of diversity as well because

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,839
not everyone is a specialist and

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,520
everything and uh

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,240
the power that the community has to

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,720
complement each other's

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
strengths is is amazing and on juju you

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,599
see that very

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,000
very very strongly and and as eric is

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,040
saying

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,720
on the chat juju you code on juju right

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,000
so code is a very

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,319
practical uh um on

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,040
on it's a material thing that is going

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,079
on it's not

00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,520
uh oh i know about this concept

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,520
you know i have i i'm trying on this no

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,280
you keep adding code together keep

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,319
adding the pie of code together and

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,200
suddenly you have

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,480
something much more complete that anyone

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,359
can go and and

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,880
use so uh it's consolidated in one place

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,000
that's what i mean it's not

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,920
only people's heads yeah

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,119
interesting that's super super

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,200
interesting eric

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,560
eric had another interesting uh point in

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,680
the chat there when he was saying

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,920
listening to what you guys were talking

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,560
about uh saying that juju is

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,520
sort of almost like juju is a cloud

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,960
distribution

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,839
given the way that you explained it does

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,839
that sort of ring true

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,079
it was not necessarily my intention but

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,960
uh

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,560
yeah i was making a comparison between

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,800
how easy it is to

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,000
how easy it is to use juju out of the

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,760
box compared to how

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,960
easy it was to use you're going to own

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
the series it was

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
out of jesus box but if you think about

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
it it can be that's the thing because

00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,680
juju

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,839
can be a call distribution if you want

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,680
to you know if you want to use that way

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,680
i'm sure that you can find and then uh

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,119
somewhere there in documentation can

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,720
find the right commands to

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,400
to make you work as a cloud distribution

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,720
in five minutes for you if you want to

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
totally okay cool so we've got uh we've

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,280
got some time we've still got lots of

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,440
time and we'll get to the

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,720
community centric stuff first but the

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,520
last thing i wanted to talk about

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,200
the sort of juju wise uh usually

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,440
specifically as a technology

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,880
is is where it's going what's uh what's

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,560
coming next what's the thing

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,920
and obviously juju as you guys have

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,440
described has

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,200
existed for a long long time and it's

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,079
been bringing in and adapting with the

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,680
times of bringing in different

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,800
technologies but what's the

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,359
what's the next thing i can talk about

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
the core

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,359
juju and chances maybe

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,520
so car wise i think we want to expand

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,680
and and

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,599
the the underlying infrastructure how

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,119
well supported underlying infrastructure

00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,160
and we gave

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,640
uh we had a spike for

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,240
for developing for for uh improving the

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,599
way that we interacted with kate in the

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,560
beginning of the year and now we want to

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,599
bring

00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:13,440
all this knowledge to uh

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,480
to the machine world as well and to

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,319
kind of level up and increase the

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,640
standard of how well we interact

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,800
with this we interact with these clouds

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,560
and i think that's a challenge for

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,119
uh the next next sprints would say

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,119
for the car

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,720
i would say kind of

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,000
follow where the wind takes us when when

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,000
we've got

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,359
the the beauty of the community i mean

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,720
i'm a product manager i'm always going

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,200
to say well we'll do what the market

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,079
wants right

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,000
super agile and we'll always shift as as

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,800
the market shifts but

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,560
so ultimately i think the goal for us is

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,280
how do we build the community right how

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,839
do we get

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,560
all of those geniuses who know the weird

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,680
amounts of stuff

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,200
all those blower moments um you know how

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,359
do we get all those into

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,040
into charms and and build the community

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,240
out and get people passionate about each

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,599
one of those

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,160
um i think that's that's like the next

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,240
big

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,359
realm and then when when we've built

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,800
that community

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,760
um we we hope that um

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,200
you know everything else will just

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,560
follow because we'll get more feedback

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,119
we'll understand how they're using it

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,640
we'll know

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,760
how to make it faster better smarter

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,240
right so i don't know but

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,359

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,720
group to take a bit of

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,720

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,359

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,839
you they're not boring dogs

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,359
you are going to be a bit entertained

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,119
there's some uh

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,800
easter eggs and some jokes they're going

00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,079
to find them

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,720
and uh so juju has two parts pretty much

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,160
if you want just

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,400
use the applications if you want to

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,800
charm your application so juju is slash

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,559

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,240
the box and has a very like five minutes

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,599

or uh lexi uh

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,240
lexi on your local host and then you can

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,280
deploy and integrate your first

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,119
applications and then

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,559
because i've been talking here for 45

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,160
minutes about how easy it is to do

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,760
things but if you do not try you're not

00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,880
gonna believe yourself you're not gonna

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,880
you're not try yourself not gonna

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,559
believe it and it's really like five six

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,680
commands that you you run so

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,599
gis slash dot slash olm if you want to

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,680
use the applications and if you are an

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,319
app developer uh an upstream map

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,040
developer

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,760
and you want to learn how to charm your

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,359
applications

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,200
using juju it's two gis slash docs

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:24,319
sdk and has a very good tutorial there

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,440
and also the community forums are

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,559
very active in terms of uh the team is

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,400
always

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,559
watching and trying to answer uh

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,480
questions there and there are no stupid

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,359
questions honestly we are

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,119

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,640
don't even know what call native is

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,720
if you just want to learn a bit more

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,079
about how to deploy your applications i

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,240
think it's

00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,680
important to stay here you're more than

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,599
welcome to interact with us there

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,400
100 100 um i also see a comment that

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,400
some of the

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
the charms were a little bit out of date

00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,680
um that sucks but

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,359
you know if we bring more community

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,640
members and hopefully they'll

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:07,839
they'll naturally update i think we've

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,160
uh you know we've done a lot to to kind

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,480
of

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,280
involve more people more communities um

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,520
to to help

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,720
update a lot of the terms but i know we

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,400
can't hit everything i think we're

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,960
prioritizing some of like the big

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,720
hitters like the most popular ones first

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,240
um the things that have been used and

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,960
deployed first but if they're ones that

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,079
you're looking for

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
definitely reach out to us in the

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,960
community because we might already be

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,359
working on it

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,640
um working on updating it um and haven't

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,280
just pushed it out yet and could use

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,480
some help

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,240
or um you know we we might be willing to

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,599
to partner with some people to

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,440
to help do that together um and

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,119
we've we've been we've been fast and

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,839
furious on this over the past couple of

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,640
months

00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,000
it's kind of been a little bit crazy so

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,400
uh yes

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,440
we've been doing a lot i'm sorry some of

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,920
them were a little bit old

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,000
but this thing has been around for like

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,960
this concept of charms and

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,720
operators has been around for you know

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,520
more than a decade so

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,520
um excuse our appearance as we update

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,119
everything

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,040
and just one last thing that i

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,160
completely forgot uh the team the juju

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,359
team economic is running some uh

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,520
charming sessions so

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,200
so everyone that works in the charm at

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,400
canonica can have the opportunity to

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,520
present that

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,040
to the to the team and show what were

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,559
the challenges how could you improve

00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,680
just trying to gather some feedback and

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,079
to

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,680
understand a bit bit more how what's the

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,800
process of developing a charm

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,480
that's open so you can interact with

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,119
all the cto the ceo all the the engineer

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,640
managers

00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,920
involved in juju i'm gonna post the link

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,440
somewhere in the comments or or i'm

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,760
gonna send it to reese and he will post

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,599
there to to serve you

so it's good

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,079
i think that definitely would violate

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:11,200
the code of conduct just saying

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,480
so for anyone uh uh

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,319

could put in the chat but for anyone

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,480
watching

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,680
not live i'll put the link in the

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
description when we're finished with the

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,160
video so you can

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,160
go ahead and click that and and i'll add

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,440
to pedro what you said one of the

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,720
coolest things about joining this

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,079
community even if you

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,280
you started knowing absolutely nothing a

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,520
way to get great mentorship and and an

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,319
awesome community just right off the bat

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,599
i mean that's

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,359
that's one of the things you love most

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,880
about open source is you know all of a

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,599
sudden you've got mentors people who are

00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,040
helping you

00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,720
just out of the goodness of their hearts

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,400
you just know

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,240
genius things the only thing is you got

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,240
to give back right so every now and then

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,800
when you know the answer you know then

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,040
you can

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,960
start sharing the love and i think it's

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,640
it's one of the most poetic things

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,400
out there especially in times of

00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,079
pandemic and covid and

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,359
having a global network of mentors

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,440
is freaking awesome yeah

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,720
it's just it's one of those things that

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,319
the people that

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,440
i've met online over the past year

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,760
that without them it would have been

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,119
such a different experience because we

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,000
were pretty much

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,640
stuck in our a stuck in our two-bedroom

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,240
one-bath

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,440
apartment for almost eight almost a year

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,920
but it helped us feel not only connected

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,880
but like we were doing

00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,400
important and interesting things and i

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,599
think that feeling

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,359
of wanting to once you've once you've

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,720
looked once you've been

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:48,319
mentored to pay that forward

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,119
in mentoring others uh and however

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,280
and mentoring can be it doesn't have to

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,680
be this big thing it can be

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
very small everyday acts of met

00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,319
mentorship

00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,920
too so and i think that that sometimes

00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:05,839
gets lost but yeah

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,920
it's just uh i agree with you completely

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,040
it's a special plug for for women and

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,400
minorities and

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,559
in tech like what a better way to

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,559
to to get involved yeah yeah

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,520
i do want to draw attention especially

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,160

you guys is there anything

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,359
you'd like to ask monica or anything you

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,000
guys would just like to you both would

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,000
just like to say

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,880
yeah i'd say um

00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:58,079
[Music]

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,599
um it's early i understand man reece

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,440
just put us on the spot and i'm working

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:05,119
on like four hours sleep

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,440
so um it's just saying what are

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,319
kind of maybe like if you have a

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,319
personal

00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:15,440
like community goal or something you'd

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:18,559
love to see happen in the juju

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,839
and or charms cup community

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,839
maybe what would that be

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,839
um i would like to see

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,920
two things that come into my mind i'd

00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,720
like to see

00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,599
more cases of people who were devops

00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,839
elite trades

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,240
didn't know anything about that about

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,000
deploying their applications

00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,319
so people who use juju as a way to to

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,400
catapult their

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,160
their applications in a quick and

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,559
reliable way

00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,559
and the second thing i would like to see

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,880
charms being developed by multiple

00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,480
people

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,720
so multiple people engage in one

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,000
in one charm i know these are very

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,280
specific things but they're very

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,200
powerful within the

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,960
the digital universe and i mean a lot

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,119
for for the for the project as

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,559
a whole two milestones that i have in my

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,720
head

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,720
in

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,480
awesome for me

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,319
if you go to charmhub.io which is

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,200
basically the collection of old little

00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:29,280
charms and

00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,240
and all the applications that we help

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,480
manage

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,920
you'll see on on the left hand side is a

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,000
list of categories

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,040
i want to see the number of categories

00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,760
just like explode

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,280
and like and the feedback that i would

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,799
get as a product manager to

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,480
be like you know the the high level

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,480
categories aren't enough i need more

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,079
detail granular ways to be able to find

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,200
the term that i need

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,559
um if i ever got that

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,880
piece of feedback oh my gosh i would be

00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,000
so happy like chef's case that would be

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,440
the most beautiful thing

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,119
i can imagine where like you know

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,799
the because the use cases of these

00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,839
charms the amount of things that they

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,000
can do

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,040
the the power that it can and the way

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,559
that it can elevate different

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,240
communities if your retail

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,680
finance telco emma lops like all the

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,559
stuff like no matter what you're doing

00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,960
it could help you

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,760
and and i think when i see those

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,680
categories

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,079
exploding i think that's when i'll know

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,720
that you know we've we've reached

00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,760
the breadth of the community it deserves

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,160
yeah

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,119
i think clearly what we need to do is

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,240
maybe in

00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,520
six months have you all back on

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,920
see how that's going and definitely

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,280
you know i think i don't want to speak

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,160
for rhys but i'm totally going to speak

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,799
for rhys

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,359
that whatever you all want to do with

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,720
either

00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,359
on airs or you know either office hours

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,839
or other

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,559
on-air because i think our goal is to

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,720
have

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,839
a whole bunch of people doing content

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,520
for ubuntu

00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:03,040
on air and so having more

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,160
like juju and charming um

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,480

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,520

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,319
and by people like eric and by this

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,559
growing

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,400
community that would be that'd be

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,440
