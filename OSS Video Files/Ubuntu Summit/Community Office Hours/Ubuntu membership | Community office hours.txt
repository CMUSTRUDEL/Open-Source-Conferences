00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,439
it's the emea americas friendly

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,280
that people on the west coast of the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
united states can

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
actually be here for without waking up

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,520
when it's still

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,720
dark but the next week we are going to

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,479

and that is at noon utc

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
that is a little more doable for our

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
friends in

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,400

be here with some awesome guests uh as

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,240
far as what has been going on

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,719
in the community this week

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
uh if you notice there has been some

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
more chat

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,360
on in the ubuntu discourse

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,760
uh on we're still kind of we're having

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
this great conversation with the

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,440
community about the gpg

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,239
key signing for memberships which is

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,480
kind of a

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,640
perfect segue soon to our guest

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,879
uh and so we've been having these

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
conversations with the community

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,720
we're going to be having a talk about

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,080
that next week

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,280
um and and that's going to happen

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,760
with either recent myself and the

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
council and then also we've been having

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,480
some talks with

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,680
other with other canonical people to

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
find out

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
you know if we do change

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
this method of signing the code of

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,920
conduct

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
then how then why do we need to change

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,920
it but also

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,080
how do we change it so this conversation

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,920
is happening we're excited for anything

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,360
that can potentially make it easier

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,640
to have people become members

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,680
because our episode today

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,319
is going to focus all about

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
membership and to do that we're actually

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,120
going to have

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,080
two uh two

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,840
members here and hopefully three our

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
third one is having technical

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,720
difficulties but he will be joining us

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:42,799
if he if he can but we have

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,000
diogo from the ubuntu portugal podcast

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,599
who became a member um

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,840
i believe this past year

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:57,200
yeah hello hello everyone

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
it was in march this year i think exit

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
ellen

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,200
and then we also have dan

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,480
hello dan and dan how long have you been

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,319
a member for um so

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,760
i became a member shortly after the 1810

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
cycle okay so actually so both of you

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,759
are

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,440
fairly recent considering how

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,400
far back some of the memberships go

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
absolutely yeah now dan what's

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,040
interesting is that you became

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,960
a member and if you want to show off

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
that t-shirt this is a great time to

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,440
show

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,720
it off lubuntu represents

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,000
yup excellent

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,720
and so you became a member through the

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,960
through the lubuntu council

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
yeah through the lubuntu team um i

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
became a member

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,080
um i actually started uh helping the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,680
team for the 1810 cycle

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
and then about six months after that um

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
i became a member i applied for

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,840
membership and became a member through

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
that team

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
yeah i guess and that's i think a really

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
and because there's all these different

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,039
ways to

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,520
become a member

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,800
either through these councils i know

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,160
that

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,639
that could that kubuntu also you can

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
become

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,039
an ubuntu member through their council

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
and we asked for some of them to join us

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
but they weren't able to join us this

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,320
time so hopefully

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,000
next time um and i know that our

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,800
other guest um who is uh uh larry who

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,919
will hopefully

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,280
be joining us

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,720
uh you might know him as wild man

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,759
on discourse and the ubuntu forums

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,120
he became a member through the through

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,960
the forums

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,680
and so uh even though diogo and i

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
both became members through kind of the

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
general

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
process because i als i feel like that

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,280
hair clip for men

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
it's like i'm not only uh you know it's

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,360
like i'm

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
not only the president i'm also a cl

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
so i'm not only the community

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,800
representative but i'm also

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,560
a member too and i became a member

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,560
in december and diogo i remember you

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
were one of the first people who told me

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,360
i should apply for

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,880
membership years back

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,919
yeah yep it was talking about

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,000
um ubukan uh and i was like

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,600
i don't know how it's like i want to go

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
but i don't know how to get there and

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
he's like if you're a member oh

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
you can apply for funding and i'm like

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,880
but i'm

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,479
not a member and he's like well you

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,479
should apply

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,800
now it which was funny because i was

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,639
convinced that you were

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
a member for a long time

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
lots of people thought that um because i

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
i was

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
very engaged with the community uh in

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
well

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,680
at least in europe uh and uh

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,160
yeah usually most people that are so

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,520
much engaged with the community as i was

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,360
were members so but i wasn't i mean

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,800
i hadn't had the need uh i hadn't had

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,639
i hadn't hit any barrier to contribution

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,840
that uh

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:38,240
made me do it i started the process

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,440
many many years ago but i then left it

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,560
and oh no completed this year

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,599
so so when when was it that you

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,319
started get um and this is a question

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
for both

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,800
of you when did you both um

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,560
kind of what was your first kind of um

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,479
exposure to the ubuntu com community

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
when did you kind of hear about it and

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,479
realize that this was

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,479
a thing

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,800
mine go first um well i was

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
actually on the hunt if you will to

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
contribute to

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
some project and i had originally

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
started off

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,759
looking at some some other projects

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,479
and um i'd even reached out but

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
one of them was the karora team i don't

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,000
know if you remember that distribution

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
and they folded and it was about the

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
time they were

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
closing down shop if you will and i they

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,399
thought they were going to restart again

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
with different management but it never

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,959
happened

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
and so i had actually reached out to

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
them to help because i was

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
you know a user and i'd been you know

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
trying it out and i knew they needed

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,800
some help so i was like

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,320
well that sounds great i could probably

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,680
lend a hand here

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,640
and um that didn't work so

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,399
i eventually stumbled upon the lubuntu

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,920
team and they were going through a

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
big uh change with 1810 so we changed

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,320
from the lxde

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
desktop environment to the lxq desktop

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
environment and

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
candidly still started with handily it

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
still started with

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
l oh yeah yeah but it needed a lot of

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
help and it

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,279
needed a lot of testing and it needed

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,000
some new documentation the whole thing

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,800
so that's when i was like this team

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
needs

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,920
someone to to lend a hand so i wanted to

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
jump right in i've been

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,640
a linux user for a very long time and

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,399
felt like i wanted to give back

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,399
to some community somewhere so this

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,200
was a perfect opportunity to jump in

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,240
because there was a lot of positions and

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,440
you know available uh options to

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
to lend a hand so it it felt comfortable

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
for me

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,399
and everywhere i turned i i meant

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,480
encouragement and

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,600
uh you know people willing to help me

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,000
help them so it just it just evolved

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,240
very quickly and it was great

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,560
that's awesome thank you and

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
diogo what was your experience how did

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
you find

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,800
out about the ubuntu community what was

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,760
some of your early involvement

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,920
so uh in portugal um we had a

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,800
fairly active small community at the

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,480
time

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
it was many years ago i don't even know

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,920
how many but it was uh

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,959
very shortly after ubuntu uh came out

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,320
uh for the first time and uh there was

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,440
this guy called sean nevis which

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,560
was one of the first

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,600
few ubuntu members he

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,279
and also marco costa i think it was his

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,720
name and they were organizing uh

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,480
regular meetups and at the time i was

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
using ubuntu's and i

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,600
they were both members of other

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
communities i was

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,000
a member so i i

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,680
yeah they told me about this and uh they

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
they spread the message the message

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,320
quite well within the portuguese

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
free software in open source communities

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,279
so

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
i started attending the events and i

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,079
started learning

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,920
more about ubuntu the ubuntu community

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,120
about ubuntu membership

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,440
all those things and uh yeah at the time

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
i was still using both debian and ubuntu

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,839
but

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,680
then with unity i just continued using

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,079
ubuntu because i uh at the beginning the

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
first

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,200
month i hated unity and then i fell in

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,240
love

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,240
and then and and now i can stop using it

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,279
yeah we all kind of go through those

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,160
stages and thankful

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
only now i haven't played with it yet

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
but i know

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,079
that i have heard really good things

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
about

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,720
the remix so yeah and so

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,480
i do want to like maybe during the next

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,519
testing cycle which is going to be on us

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,279
like it feels like it's christmas you

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
know we get to christmas and we're like

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,320
how is it already christmas

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,000
again and then it becomes like oh

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,120
it's another testing s cycle didn't we

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,839
just do this but i think that i would

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,880
like to

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,839
um maybe help out with some of the with

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,200
the

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,480
the unofficial fl avers but i've heard

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,240
really good things about that one so

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,399
now uh no dan what was it that

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,240
so you were doing mostly testing

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah i originally started with mostly

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,079
testing um

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
you know we were there was a lot of

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,800
things that were in motion

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,240
so test testing was important i also did

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,800
some help in the documentation area

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,760
because we had a lot of need for that as

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,600
well

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,560
our documentation manager uh lynn

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
is is fantastic and she she does an

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,519
excellent job we have a

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,200
fantastic manual yeah um we are hoping

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
to get her on the show

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
one day so um if you have a good

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,279
experience

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,639
make sure to let her know and we'd

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,800
actually oh my gosh i would have

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
loved to have like an all documentation

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,600
show oh that would be great i know she

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
did a presentation a couple of years ago

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
at scale i believe

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
and i i watched that it was pretty good

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
um

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,000
and but so i did some help there uh with

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,160
with a few things um you know adding

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,680
some screenshots and stuff like that and

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,320
thing you know things of those nature um

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
and then um also did some you know

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,880
publicizing

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,240
because we had you know new new desktop

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,959
environment so

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
went out and uh did some you know blog

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,959
posts things

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,519
things of like that um and uh forum

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
posts

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
that sort of stuff yeah and i think

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,040
that's a really

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,600
important point to keep in mind that

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,120
publicizing

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
ubuntu and getting the word out is such

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
an

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,959
important contribution and and i know

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
a lot of people might not think of it as

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
one but

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
it's like no you're helping find new

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
users and new com

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,399
munity members and so

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
it's just it's it's one of those that's

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,800
really kind of

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:31,160
unsung but it's just

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,920
i think it's equally value

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,959
valuable to every other form of

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,199
uh every other form of contribution to

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,199
it is for sure yeah

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
and it seems like uh

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,839
sorry every now and then my my speech

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,040
gets uh

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,440
gets a bit ahead of me but diogo

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,279
it seemed like you had a point to go off

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
of that

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,240
yeah yeah um it's not only helping

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,800
it does not only help the community also

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,880
helps the the people that need ubuntu

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,079
because ubuntu actually helps other

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
people uh

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,160
there are people that only started

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,440
working in i.t because they have

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,800
ubuntu and free software which is

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,639
usually obtained for free and

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
it has all the professional tools they

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,160
need

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,079
and it just enables people

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,440
and the fact it is for free that is

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,320
developed uh i think people

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
normal people in mind not just uh

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,079
techies

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,680
uh it really is very helpful uh not only

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,600
for women to communicate but also for

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,800
the entire humanity

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,160
yeah that really that kind of

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,040
personally speaks to me my husband got

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
involved

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
in linux and free and open source

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,199
software through

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,600
ubuntu with hardy heron

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,360
because he blew up his uncle's computer

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,639
which had

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,399
windows didn't have the money to buy

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,199
a new the new the new

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,519
license and so his uncle had one you

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,199
know it's back when the disc came in

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:25,279
the magazines and gave him the disc

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:28,519
and now my husband is a

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,000
he is a budding junior software

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,279
developer

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,360
and just and he and he got his

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,920
uh his job that he's had for

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,079
three oh god four years now four years

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,759
now oh my god it's been that long

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,199
um he got it because of his extensive

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,120
kind of self and community taught

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,959
knowledge that he had that all started

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
with using hardy

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,560
heron so yeah it's

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
really important i can echo some of that

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
too

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
on a professional level um certainly

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,439
ubuntu

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
and free and open source software is

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,039
very

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
uh much the core of what i what i do

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
professionally

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,919
um i i manage a team that you know part

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,720
of the team is

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
you know their server administrators and

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
um we we very

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,760
much rely on that and uh we we use other

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
tools

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
as well um but um uh you know free and

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,520
open source and ubuntu

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
they're right at the core of it so and

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
i'd like to think

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
that i certainly advocate for that and

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,799
uh

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
that that's that's a lot of why i

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,000
certainly gravitate towards this

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,280
community myself

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
yeah it's just and it is

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
one of the things that it's it's brought

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
in

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
a lot of really great people who i

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,640
virtually met over the past

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,200
two years so and hopefully at an

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,160
event oh and it's you know it would be

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
really

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,960
interesting and i think we have enough

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,640
people in the chats to find out

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,520
what release was the um was kind of

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
people's first because i see that um

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
that

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,679
yannick also discovered

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
ubuntu at the same time that my husband

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,360
did

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,039
so and i think that heron might be a

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
really

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,600
that might be a kind of dominant answer

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
then

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,880
that's awesome and gorion i don't know

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,480
if you've seen the

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,160
um let me see if i can show this

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,520
on oh i can show that that's awesome

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
so gorion's posted that he's a senior

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
engineer

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
at intel building up infrastructure for

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,520
a data center that is entirely

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,960
fast-paced on ubuntu

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,880
super cool very nice very cool

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,360
yeah i know it is fancy so

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,840
and it's just like it's like oh wait i

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,160
can show this to

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,919
everybody so still still kind of

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
learning everything that stream yard

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,240
does

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,919
but yes it is nice so what was it

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,919
that made you want to apply

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
for membership and were there any kind

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,600
of

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
when kind of the when membership kind of

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,039
first got

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,400
mentioned was there anything that kind

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,039
of made you go

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,600
i don't know if i am ready for that

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,280
yeah i can say i certainly probably felt

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
some imposter syndrome

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,440
um you know like me like

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,919
am i worthy of that but everywhere i

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
turned

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
everyone in the team certainly said that

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
yeah absolutely your contributions

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
matter

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
and they've been sustained and uh you

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,000
know so

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,480
please do apply and here's the the path

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
to do that and if you have any questions

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,160
please reach

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
out to us and we'll help you with any

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,240
any question you have

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,640
like no question was ever

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,400
thought to be a dumb question if you

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,280
will and uh

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
everything you know it i and i know it's

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
not super easy and that's certainly been

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,480
discussed in the forum

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
and you're probably getting to that but

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,600
um

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,520
if there was any doubt that you didn't

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,280
understand one step or the other

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
then they certainly were there to help

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,840
you so

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,960
i i just met encouragement everywhere i

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
turned and couldn't

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
couldn't get away from it so i felt like

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
yeah i should probably join then

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
so and then it just evolved from there

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,320
like i i went from

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
a member to a developer to a council

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
member

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
uh you know and it just it just

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,559
snowballed from there so you know

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
it's been great it's been a great ride

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,559
yeah and what and

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,559
this is really cool being a part of

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,120
one of the flavors that has a membership

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,159
route

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
because for ubuntu mate we didn't have

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,760
that

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,720
and yannick and big pot i hope you are

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,720
lit

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,280
listening because i see you both in the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
chat and sometimes it can be hard to

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,559
convince

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,039
people who contribute to flavors that

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,080
they

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,480
it's contributing to ubuntu

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,919
and because i know i face that it's like

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
well i don't contribute to

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,360
ubuntu and then people go but you

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,400
contribute to ubuntu

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,640
mate right and it's like yes and it's

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,679
like well then you contribute to

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,039
ubuntu and it's like oh

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,480
okay and so i think thankfully with

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,400
lubuntu and kubuntu you've got that you

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,440
know you've got that baked in

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,120
with the membership via the team but i

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,679
think especially for

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,480
you know maybe like budgie and studio

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,320
and

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,320
mate and um i can't remember if

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,720
and because i i don't think that kailan

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,360
has

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,600
a team that goes through membership

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,919
zubuntu i can't remember if they have

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,919
one

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,159
if they have a team that qualifies for

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,679
membership this is always the most

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,240
nerve-wracking part

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,880
to try and remember all the official

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
flavors

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,799
and not leave one out but but

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
but i i'm so glad that your teams it's

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,159
like

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
you know that it's like i'm contributing

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,159
yes to this

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,480
specific part of ubuntu but that's that

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,960
is still a valid contribution

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,600
that counts absolutely i i yeah

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
absolutely

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,799
yeah oh yes so yes so subuntu is an

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
official flavor but what i can't

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,640
remember

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,120
is if they have a

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,600
if they're team if you can get ubuntu

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,640
membership for being part of their team

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,720
like with lubuntu and kubuntu

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,720
and i think for the older eduboontu that

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,600
yes that that was true so

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
so yes so for all of you from the

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,799
flavors who have been waiting

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,640
if you should apply for membership

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,679
yes the answer is yes so do it

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,120
yeah yeah and and

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,440
diogo what were when you

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,520
when the question of membership came up

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,080
did you have any of those same

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,120
issues yeah the imposter syndrome is

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,200
certainly

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,159
something that it's lots of us and

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
it was the other community members uh

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,320
both in particular and abroad that

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,840
actually convinced me that i should

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,960
apply um

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,159
and i started doing that and yeah

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,039
that's how it rolled it took a few years

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,080
but

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,240
i ended up doing it because

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,360
the wiki is still one of the questions

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
that needs to be

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,679
worked out in the in the process

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
yeah so i was just going to ask in

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,080
addition to

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,279
the imposter syndrome

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,640
which is very much something in my

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,760
membership path that came up but again i

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,120
had that group of

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,679
incredibly supportive people

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,559
who were just like of course you know

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,679
it's like you

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,880
are it's like it's like what you

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,440
are doing is valid and needed and

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,919
you've been doing it for six months so

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,039
yes

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,240
you should really do that

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,679
and i had and i also had and when we get

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,320
to the technical

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,320
parts of the membership journey i'll

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,520
bring these up too

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,960
um but again i think that

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,760
the supportive nature of our

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,080
community i think is most evident when

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,799
we

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,279
kind of don't feel great about ourselves

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,640
and

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,679
our abilities and then others go are you

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,120
kidding

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,840
you do all these you put so much energy

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,960
and time

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,240
and skill and it's just it's it's nice

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,679
to have because i think that

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,600
all of us have kind of faced this

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,080
there is a part of the process that

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,320
really uh helps boosts your confidence

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
is

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
when you start asking people to

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,120
recommend you

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,400
yeah yep and i think that that's true of

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,400
anything you try new

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
right you don't feel super comfortable

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,240
with it at the at the start

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,600
so until you've you've been doing it a

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
little bit maybe

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
you know you don't feel as comfortable

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,919
and then you know i've seen

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,600
i've seen the the roles shift over time

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,240
for me even in the short time that i've

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,279
been

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,120
involved where now i'm starting to

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,159
encourage other people to

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,840
apply for their membership as well so i

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,600
it's like i was just there a little

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,039
while ago i understand exactly what

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
you're going through

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,039
so you know i can see where you're at

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,559
and you should apply yourself

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,919
so i it's certainly get a mentor i guess

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,960
of some sort if you will and uh you know

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,640
have them help you get through uh all

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,760
those hurdles

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559
yeah it's and i think it's one of the

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,159
things that

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,559
there's just such a natural mentorship

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,320
there that and it's great to see the

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,200
people who become

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
members and in turn becoming the ones

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,559
who are saying

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,080
wait you're not a member yet oh my gosh

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,559
here what can i do to help you apply

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,760
and it's like oh get your page started

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,880
and i will leave you a testimonial

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,240
and it's just yeah and that is it's just

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,440
it's so and it's so great um every now

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,720
and then

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,159
do either of you go back to your

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,120
testimonial page

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,600
i did a lot because my process was very

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,320
long

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,360
and was i was building the the page over

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,559
the years

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,520
um and and so yeah every time i went

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,760
there i got a

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,960
little bit more motivated to to to go

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,240
there

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,000
and continue to work on it oh yeah i've

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,840
gone back to mine a couple of times too

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
and i certainly did when i applied for

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,799
developer membership

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
as well so you know i need to put a

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
little you know put some other things on

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,000
there and whatnot so yeah

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,520
i've done that as well yeah and it's

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,440
it's really good to think and guru

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,360
don't we are going to get to your

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,039
question at the end i'm going to kind of

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,960
hold that one

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,520
um that

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,960
was going to say is that membership is

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,679
just a start

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,320
it it's kind of not like oh it's like

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,399
i've

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,440
this is some peak that i've reached and

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,679
i'm never going to go

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,640
any higher um because definitely if

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,760
you're on that

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,640
developer or packager side

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,520
then it really kind of makes sense to

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559
it's like go

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,679
for you know to become a

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,240
motu or a cordov

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,200
certainly then it means that you can run

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
for any of

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,640
the council so if you kind of feel that

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,120
like if you want to become part of like

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
the

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,279
membership board or if you are really

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,880
interested

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,919
in irc things or if you want to take

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,720
that leadership role then

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,279
membership kind of opens it opens those

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,679
paths

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,720
up and i think that certainly it's kind

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,799
of one of

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,640
the things that we want to talk about

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,399
with members more

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,919
is that you know especially since we're

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:41,760
oh my gosh our community is

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,520
if it was a person you know it's hit

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,799
some milestones there

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,919
it's uh and because you know

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,279
it's like this ubuntu membership now

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,080
kind of what what what do we want it to

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,559
mean

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
and so i think that you know and it's

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
like what do we

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
and what can especially for the

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,559
community team

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,120
as in what can we empower the members

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,000
to do because i think that was one of my

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,080
favorite parts

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,480
of the wiki was to say well what do you

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,799
want to do going forward

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,720
so and just curious what were some of

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,520
the things i know diogo this might be a

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,440
little bit easier for you to remember

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
but what were what were some of the

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,080
things that you said

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,120
on your wiki that you wanted to do

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,679
as a member so let's see if i remember

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,039
because

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,640
i have a really bad memory but

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,720
i uh my goals are

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,279
mostly linked to community engagement i

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,919
i want to continue promoting ubuntu

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,880
uh both here in portugal and and abroad

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,000
because i go

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,039
a lot i i used to go a lot

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,080
abroad uh and i'll promote ubuntu in

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,559
other countries

00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,640
uh also uh i am a member

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,399
and president of the part of an

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,520
association of ubuntu

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,799
communities in europe so i have

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,720
some goals of enabling that

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,679
association uh to allow communities to

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,679
cooperate a little more and uh and share

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,240
some resources and things like that

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,320
to organize things like google cons and

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,960
other things uh

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,320
and uh yeah i think it's mostly around

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,200
those things

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,120
uh there was a time where i was living

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,279
abroad i also had goals related

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
with the community of the country that i

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,320
was in

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,279
which is no longer the case at this

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,880
point

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,919
but uh yeah uh it's mostly around this

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,640
and continue to

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,799
to to do the portuguese ubuntu podcast

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
which is something i really love and

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,080
that helps the portuguese community and

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,679
the portuguese speaking community not

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
just the portuguese

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,679
to to be aware of what's happening in

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,279
the ubuntu world

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:02,559
excellent and what about and dan what a

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,440
about you well it's a little while ago

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,600
for me but i

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,559
from what i remember i i certainly had

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,760
some of the same

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,120
aspirations in in promoting ubuntu and

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,840
laboontu um but one thing i remember

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,799
like as a developer that i wanted to

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,440
make sure to do

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,640
was also work with the upstream uh

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,440
projects that we

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,279
we bring in and i've done some of that

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,000
as well i certainly help support

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,080
uh you know i'll sit in their irc

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,600
channels and help support things

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,720
you know questions that other not even

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
ubuntu flavors you know just other you

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
know

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,360
uh distributions you know if they have a

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,000
question about the same

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,360
same project then i'll sit and and help

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you know support those things and that

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,000
was definitely

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,360
something i want to make sure to do is

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,880
is give back upstream

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,840
just as much as i did in ubuntu itself

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
so that's awesome so now i'm going to

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,679
bring in

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,200
two more people we are going to bring in

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,640
my colleague reese hello reese hello

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,399
hello and also we're going to bring in

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:15,600
larry so he has been able to join

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:18,799
hello can you hear us

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,840
oh larry can we

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,039
uh testing it testing in prod

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,039
happens in every stream

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,159
okay so

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,159
larry can you try speaking

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,760
okay i think we heard your keyboard

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,240
sorry that was me oh reese dang it

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,640
okay so larry if you think you get your

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
mic

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,000
fixed then actually i'm just gonna keep

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
you here

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,440
but if you get your mic fixed and chime

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,480
in so

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,399
excellent so all right

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,480
so when it came time to actually

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:09,440
apply um and

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,559
let's see okay so let's get this

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,679
question out of the

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,320
way did

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,279
either of you like i totally failed at

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,799
my gpg

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,440
key completely it was embarrassing i had

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,559
to get help

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,200
from bill twice to be like walk me

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,240
through this

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,600
like i was five so

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,880
yeah just a little bit painful um so did

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,080
either of you have

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,159
kind of any tech hurdles

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,720
well i was pretty nervous about it but

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,279
um i did manage to get that i don't

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
remember asking questions about the gpg

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,960
key

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,640
per se but um you're right

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,320
it's not the most straightforward

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,399
procedure um

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,919
certainly i feel like there could be

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,360
better tools to to

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,919
you know work with um and there used to

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
be

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
there used to be a thing called sea

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,559
horse and i think that still exists

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,840
but i'm not sure how developed it is

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
these days so

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,119
it doesn't it doesn't necessarily you

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,159
know a lot of folks

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,200
rely on on gooey tools and that's fine

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,079
um provided they work well and i i don't

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,119
know that that

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,800
does right so that's that's probably

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,280
one of the reasons why you fell down

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,679
there i have to guess

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,040
yeah and it's and one of the other

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,399
things and this goes back to

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,839
documentation is that some of our

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,079
documentation goes back to like oh it's

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,500
like

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,919
using 1204 it's like

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,359
[Music]

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,560
not quite so yeah it's it's

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,560
it's tricky right because you got to

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,200
think when you're doing the the gpg

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,079
signing thing g key signing thing

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,280
there's um

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,320
what are you trying to do there's two

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
things we're trying to achieve in that

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,040
process there's the

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,280
highlighting everyone's contributions

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,280
and showing them showing them off to

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,720
the council and to everybody else who's

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,320
who's sort of moderating

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,240
and then there's that then there's that

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,000
moment of you've signed the thing and

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,760
it's like a big it's a big ordeal

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
and so maybe it's maybe it's definitely

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,800
worth having something there that you

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,480
where you're signing it and it feels

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
more than just checking a box or taking

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,280
a

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,400
thing or whatever but yeah it definitely

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,200
could it doesn't really seems like it

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
could be easier

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
i haven't gone through the process

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
myself so i'm speaking as an outsider

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,839
but

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,839
we'll do it we'll do it on the stream

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,359
one time you should do it on

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,119
air do it live yeah people walk great

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,119
everyone can see everyone can watch us

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,880
fail at the gpg signing thing

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,480
and then that'll be enough of a

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,760
motivator for us to

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,640
figure something else out we'll change

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,640
it the next week

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,119
but yeah but i think that part of it is

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,880
is that you know we want something that

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
it definitely did feel like

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,000
oh it's like i it's like this is kind of

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
uh

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
you know it's like i've gone through

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,640
this process so this

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,119
you know we want some something that

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,119
where people still feel like okay this

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,640
is something that i'm going to

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,599
adhere to so that's

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,839
important but yeah it's just something

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,359
that you don't have to reset when you

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:17,920
uh forget to put your pass phrase down

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:20,720
anywhere might have done that

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,520
might have done that i know and i really

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,560
thought that i

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,000
put it down so we'll also go through

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,200
the act of me revoking my key and

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,119
reinstating it

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:38,320
so yeah so a great learning experience

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:42,480
everything it's character buildings

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,680
yeah so you so you made your pages

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,520
you got the gpg key signed

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,200
you had a lot of people who probably

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,320
told you wait you aren't

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,400
already a member i think

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,560
diogo i might have said those exact

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,680
words to you

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,640
yeah you're not the only one a lot of

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:07,440
people told me those things yeah

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,440
so what happened

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,200
oh sorry about that

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,040
so so what happened when it came time

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,480
for your irc

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,160
interview oh i was so nervous i was

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,200
terribly nervous

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,480
oh no i was but

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,960
as soon as uh someone uh i don't

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,320
even remember who was uh told me to

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
relax i just started

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
relaxing a little bit everybody was very

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,720
friendly

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,200
and then some of my friends in the

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,079
community appeared to support me so

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,800
yeah that went much better right after

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,680
that

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,839
and uh yeah it was uh it was great i

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,760
felt great after that

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,000
yeah the the the fact that the community

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,040
is so friendly it's the second time

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,760
that helps me uh surpass

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,240
this and uh this issue the first time

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
was

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,320
my first talk uh in obacon

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,599
which was also my first time speaking in

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,680
public

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,720
uh how did you become europe yeah

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,839
uh and uh it was

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,030
just after the opening session so

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,200
everyone

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:25,599
[Laughter]

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,599
and but i looked uh at the audience and

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,440
so many faces were so familiar that i

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,400
felt at home and

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,480
and yeah i i just got over it and

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,400
started talking and

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,880
it was great nice it's nice imagine how

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,400
imagine how how the uh whoever was going

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,760
first where the keynote speaker felt

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,839
like oh no i've got to go before this

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,839
guy's gonna be so good

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,440
yeah oh i i know when it came time for

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,280
my meeting i felt

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,119
equally nervous and i don't know why but

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,520
i did um

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,119
and i i probably shouldn't have because

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,200
the questions were not hard and they

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,839
weren't things i couldn't answer and

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,839
you know certainly none of it that i

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,320
didn't have ready to go but

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,280
i don't know it just felt like it you

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,800
know it felt formal

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,040
and uh you know a little bit of an

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,599
inquisition even though it wasn't that

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,320
bad

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,800
um so yeah i felt a little nervous about

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,400
it but

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,079
i think i think it was a good thing um

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
certainly makes you know that you're

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,119
alive right so um

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,480
you know it was it was not as bad as i

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,000
had made it out to be yeah

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,640
and it and it it the fact that uh

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,760
it feels important it feels that you

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,280
achieved something

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,320
and and it's something that

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,400
gives you happiness when you you are we

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,720
have done it

00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:00,880
oh yeah i i totally had a s

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,920
celebratory tweet after

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,800
my meeting which was and also i might

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,800
have made a pumpkin cream cheese star

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,240
like oh god i should go and find it but

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,400
i put

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,680
like the kind of cream cheese swirl

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,800
tried to put it in

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,839
an ubuntu logo type shape

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,640
oh wow that's pretty cool yeah it's

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,560
awesome

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,000
it kind of like if you squinted and

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,720
looked at it the right way

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,960
then it could be could have been this

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,400
could have been the circle of friends

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,680
but i did feel like the questions were

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,839
they real they did make me think but

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,920
they weren't anything i didn't feel like

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,680
they were like gotcha

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,760
questions yeah exactly yeah it was

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,000
it was more just like getting you to

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,079
think a little bit more deeply

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,040
about things and it was really

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,319
it was really nice and hopefully dan

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,480
llewellyn isn't

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,520
listening to this saying need more

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,640
puzzles and

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,800
hard super hard questions ask more

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,359
riddles

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,079
just kind of like the ubuntu sphinx or

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,520
something

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
or something like that which would be

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,440
kind of

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,560
awful but um but no it is just

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,960
it feels and afterwards you just like

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,640
i don't know if there's an opposite of

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,440
imposter

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,000
syndrome i would say it's the feeling

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,920
you get

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,520
after they say you're a member

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,880
yeah yeah i agree

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,480
it's just affirmation syndrome

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,960
i don't know maybe yeah i don't think

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,000
it's a syndrome anymore right

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,839
it's just a good feeling it is a very

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,280
good

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,640
feeling euphoria i think is the the term

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,040
that comes to mind

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,640
there you go yeah yeah ubuntu euphoria

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,520
that's a that's a good uh that's

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,160
excellent

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,839
yeah here we go cool there should be a

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,839
release called euphoric

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
something

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,400
now maybe we'll get it there maybe we'll

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
get it

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,760
so so for anyone in the chat who

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,640
is either going to be applying for

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,480
membership

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,319
soon or who might be on the fence

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,760
about applying kind of and what advice

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:37,119
would you give them beyond

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,480
what you've all already said

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,160
give it to me give me the advice

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,200
um so go ahead

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,920
oh yeah i i say just

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,880
go for it i mean um probably said that

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,079
already once but

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,240
yeah i think uh i think yeah just

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,280
just grab a buddy if you have any

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,560
questions

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,119
and and ask ask away but uh certainly

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,560
don't

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,760
feel like you need to hesitate because

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,599
someone's probably there to help you and

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,280
um you i'm sure

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,560
i mean every one of us i mean

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,079
contributing on on some level with some

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,480
aspects so go for it yeah yeah for sure

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,839
that

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,040
they raise already has some significant

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,560
contributions

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,920
that uh would lead in sectors

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,800
i believe uh yeah and and even if you

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,920
have to do the

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:40,480
the gpg thing which looks uh

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:44,079
scary uh it's not so hard uh

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,880
there are graphical tools uh thunderbird

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,480
itself

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,839
has some tools that allow uh to do this

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,800
also yes thunderbird is actually

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,960
pretty good now it used to be an add-on

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
that you had to add to thunderbird but

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
the

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,079
new thunderbird has gpg stuff built in

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,520
which is great thunderbirds are good eh

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,560
that's good

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,560
yeah exactly

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,440
all right and if you have to repeat it

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,400
just okay it's okay

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,599
no it's not it's not a problem just

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,040
repeat it

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,520
uh i was uh an ideal case because i

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,280
already

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,760
was using gpg before and uh because i'm

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,680
very

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,760
privacy sensitive and i i

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,359
yeah i just like it and believe that

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,200
everybody should be using it if

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
even if i don't always use it

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,079
but um

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,680
yeah you go ahead do it and uh

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,560
if you have to repeat it yeah it's okay

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,240
too uh i'm pretty sure that approval

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,880
will be swift for you

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,240
and for many of those that are in the

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,079
chat and

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,480
that i know they've contributed so

00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,240
there's no problem about that the wiki

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,839
itself will give you some trouble

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,920
because the wiki is really old

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:09,520
and slow but okay

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,119
just go do it today a little bit a bit a

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,359
little bit tomorrow

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,119
just continue doing it just don't stop

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,880
don't do like me that stopped for a few

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,880
years then continue then stop

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,720
sorry dan no that's just gonna say that

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,359
the wiki is great because you can build

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,119
on it

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,560
as you go you don't have to do it all at

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,560
one sitting

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,079
certainly keep keep building on it and

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,760
then when you're ready to go it'll be

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,000
there

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,920
yes and um bitten actually

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,920
brings up a good point is that this was

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,640
my thing trying to figure

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,560
figure out how to edit my well how to

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,839
create my page and then how to

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,000
edit it and so it was um

00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,599
and and certainly one of those things

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,480
and i think that we're going to have

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,880
all kinds of links in our discourse post

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,079
for

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,359
this office hours and

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,400
having one on where you go to

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,480
be added to the wiki editors

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,920
but don't worry we uh we have some

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,440
people who are very

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,640
responsive to those requests

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,880
and we'll get them filled very quickly

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,319
uh and then also things for like my

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,119
thing was i had no idea how to edit in

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,240
moinmoin so what i did was i just took

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,359
my friend bill

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,800
and i just took the code from his

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,800
and i just changed it

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,800
i'm sure there's something yeah i was

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,839
just going to say there's some templates

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,200
that you could just

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:50,560
start with yeah yeah yeah

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,800
which were really helpful um

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,560
so either kind of and so we'll try and

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,319
find one of those

00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,680
templates if um if not i've got a really

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:04,960
super basic page if you want to steal

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,200
borrow that you're totally welcome to

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,240
um but let's see

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,880
um but i think having but also maybe

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,319
having

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,680
you know people who are members

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,920
who would would be okay being

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,040
mentors to people going through the

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
process

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:30,319
and so if you uh we'll post we'll post

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,319
the discourse link i'm actually going to

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,000
post this now but we'll also post this

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,720
in

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,640
our kind of post office hours tweet and

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,720
elsewhere um if you would like to be

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,920
a mentor to someone going through the

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,079
membership process

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,040
then please just kind of post on that

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,000
link and say

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,240
hey i would be happy to help you know

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,359
help answer your questions

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,760
and um and help you know

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,440
help kind of guide you through and

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
because that's one of the things i know

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,000
that

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,760
reese and i have talked about that we'd

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,200
love to see more

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,760
kind of formal mentorship we have a lot

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,359
of i think

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,839
unofficial mentorship that goes on

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,960
but we want to be sure that people who

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,000
that we

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,520
kind of just do just start making this a

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,720
regular process that we can help

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,680
newcomers to the community find mentors

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,119
to guide them

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,559
and just make that just a standard part

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,359
of what this community is and often

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,920
often it's a

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,520
more it's less uh sort of instructional

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,200
more just reassurance right because

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,640
the wiki the wiki editing adding to wiki

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,680
editors groups and while it is an issue

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,480
and that's definitely something we

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,240
should

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,599
figure out a better way to do it's just

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,720
it's a set of instructions that you can

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,000
do and you can follow

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,760
but along the way you're thinking to

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,800
yourself oh is this the right way to do

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,359
it or is this

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,559
am i am i doing this well is could i be

00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,119
doing this better and if you just had

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,280
someone

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,240
even if you just had someone saying yes

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,720
that that's good

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,920
that's fine that's what makes you feel

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,520
better right so

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,559
yeah absolutely yeah so i am going to

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,319
share this post

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,559
that some of the that yannick i think

00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:21,280
will be an interesting

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:23,839
um mentor there so

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,119
yeah so it's just that mentorship with a

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,440
personal touch

00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,520
there so yannick thank you so much

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,920
but otherwise you don't even have to go

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,920
other to go to people's places and kick

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,160
them in the posterior just to give them

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,200
an

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,240
encouraging word and i think definitely

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,440
all of us who

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,200
felt like who felt like i am not ready

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,440
to apply

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,119
why would they want me i'm not doing

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,240
things that are

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,880
doing things that are important

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,839
for you to share your experiences with

00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,480
people and say i

00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,400
felt a lot of these things and here's

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,400
what helped me

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,400
that that's just that's great so

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,400
yeah i can say i had great mentorships

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,960
and and uh

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,359
you know a couple of people that were

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:17,200
definitely uh prominent

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:19,359
there uh helped me get over some of my

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,400
own shortcoming you know as far as a

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,839
fear

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,119
in in that what i was doing was

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:30,240
significant yeah

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,400
i had not so much uh

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,680
mentorship but some recommendations from

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,319
my

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,520
several friends in the ubuntu community

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,720
uh

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,520
and yeah and that helped uh even if it's

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,240
just

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,599
not just one mentor it's just your

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,720
friends in the community giving you

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,920
advice

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,079
uh look at my page how i did it

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,480
or you're doing too much you're putting

00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,760
too much effort in that thing and you

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,800
don't need to do that

00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,000
uh yeah if you

00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,839
if you don't mind me asking who were

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,599
these who were your mentors if that's

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,319
something you wanted to shout out

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,960
sure two people that i'll shout out uh

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,240
one is

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:14,079

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,599
but in a good way so i'm i'm they were

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,160
very much in the forefront for that's

mentorship for new people

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,240

and that's good in the portuguese ubuntu

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,880
community we are we are doing

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,920
um a monthly meeting every month for

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,960
over five years

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,160
we missed one month uh

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,319
we are doing it online now um and yeah a

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,280
few of the first few online sessions

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,240
were actually

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,359
uh helping people to sign the code of

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,800
conduct uh

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,079
to to to get to know launchpad better to

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,960
get to know all the

00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,240
all the tools the wiki the ask ubuntu

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,440
all those things

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,480
uh it helped a few a few more

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,400
assigned code of conduct a few more got

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,319
into translations

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,119
so it did help so if your uh

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,599
local community uh is doing this sort of

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,839
things

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,119
uh and in your language to help you

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,319
understand things better

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,720
yeah that's a great thing to do that's

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,160
awesome

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,559
that's great yeah so um

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,280
i think we do have a little bit of time

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,640
for

00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,599
questions so we had a question it was

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,839
oh i need to go back because it was way

00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,839
back

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,839
here

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,599
oh my gosh this was way back here i

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,920
really need to put

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,920
time stamps oh there we go

00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,839
oh

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,559
what does membership give to the holder

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,400
besides big satisfaction

00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,839
and then we all talked about how it was

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,040
a lot of warm and fuzzy

00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:12,240
feelings besides the boot to euphoria

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
of course right

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,839
so obviously we yes obviously we could

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,880
link you know

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,040
the membership page but for you

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,319
what is what do you think the biggest

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,760
benefit has been

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,760
for each of you

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,920
well i think it gives you a sense of

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,280
belonging

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:41,280
in in something that is uh important

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,280
and um you know

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:49,520
it's it broadens your circle if you will

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:54,160
you you join a bigger circle um

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:57,040
i think when you do that and so it

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,839
yeah i guess it does give you a a good

00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,280
feeling

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:04,480
but it also

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,559
lets you join hands i guess with

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,000
other members and you get to learn some

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,040
of their story and some of their

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,160
contributions

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,520
and i think uh just just

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,440
gathering together is is a big

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,119
piece of it i mean obviously you get you

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,280
get a new spiffy little email

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,400
address too to go along with that but um

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,119
there's yeah it's it's just a it's a

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,200
good

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,520
group to belong to everyone is

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,839
encouraging each other

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:39,200
um and uh yeah

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:42,319
yeah besides all of that obviously uh

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,200
uh country community contribution uh is

00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,480
about taking

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:50,000
ownership uh ubuntu membership

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,200
uh allows you to make further

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,880
types of contributions uh it it opens

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,040
the scope of

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,280
ways where you can contribute and take

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,440
ownership of ubuntu which is something

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,920
that you use for yourself so you

00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,400
you might want to to have some ownership

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,400
over it

00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,640
excellent and we have a follow-up

00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,640
question

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,440
what do the members have or need to do

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,720
once they are

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,960
members well

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,079
i think keep doing what you're doing i i

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,520
think that's that's

00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:30,720
it sustained contributions is

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,520
is part of membership so

00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,000
just just keep being you yeah you're

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,160
already doing it right

00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,280
yeah you're doing something right yeah

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,160
we

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,440
the for the first question about yeah

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,640
keep going keep doing more for

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,480
the first question for what you get out

00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,680
of it monica what what what about you

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,319
what do you uh

00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,799
what do you feel is a benefit well

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,960
what's

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,960
funny is because a lot of things that i

00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,200
put in my

00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,559
you know what what i want to do as

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:08,640
a member i'm actually doing

00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:11,920
as part of my job here and but i think

00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,890
what is it's weird because it all kind

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,000
of i became

00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,680
[Music]

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,920
a member in december and then i

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,839
and then i interviewed for this job a

00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,960
month afterwards

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,079
and so what was interesting i think it

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,119
made

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:33,359
it certainly made this job a lot

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,079
more meaningful because i'm not just

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,880
you know representing a community that i

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,839
don't have a

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,680
connection to the ubuntu community isn't

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,359
just some kind of abstract thing

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,799
and when i'm done with work i don't

00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,599
think about it

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,720
ask my husband i think about it all the

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,920
time

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,079
and he's probably he's probably like

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,520
oh my gosh does she ever talk about

00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,880
anything else

00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,480
but for me it's played those podcast

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,000
episodes

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,400
yes i know he's probably like man

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,720
it's like i have no one to blame but me

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,839
and he's exactly right

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,359
um but i think it

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:19,040
it does make this it makes

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:21,200
this not so much a job but as a

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,640
duty in the most important sense of the

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,599
word because

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,640
i'm helping to support and create a

00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,119
community

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,480
that i am a part of and want to be a

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,559
part of going forward

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,119
no matter what happens and it is just

00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,160
it's especially being part of this

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,480
movement of

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:46,000
you know these very warm helpful people

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,000
who want to

00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,559
who just who want to kind of get not

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,400
only

00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:57,920
that kind of that feeling out but this

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,920
system that they've built on top of that

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,240
that has helped a lot of people like my

00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,440
husband and countless other people

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,839
around the globe um it's kind of

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,720
yeah it's it's kind of a whole bunch of

00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,920
things

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,760
so cool that's me it's really

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,599
interesting it's this sort of

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,400
in terms of uh uh in participation in

00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,680
the

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,319
sort of the reverse of me right because

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,000
i joined uh

00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,200
knowing the idea and liking the idea of

00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
resource community in the ability

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,160
community

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,480
and then as i uh became part of a

00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,559
canonical became part of chronicle

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,240
i very much gravitated towards the

00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,599
community and started contributing

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,200
from the other way around right so

00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,280
instead of it being gratifying it was it

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,400
was a discovery process so it's a really

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,079
it's really interesting that you could

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,799
do it both ways around right you can go

00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,480
from

00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:46,480
an ability contributed to someone who

00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,440
does more and you go from someone and

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,440
very easily i think

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
i went from someone who didn't do

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,960
anything and didn't know a tremendous

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,240
amount about it to someone who

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,359
does some stuff you know it's good

00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,599
the i just want to highlight the

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,400
the last sort of question slash comment

01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,440
that i'm

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,559
just going to show it on the screen

01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,000
because i think it's interesting to hear

01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,960
from you guys about it

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,640
which is um which oh everyone's covered

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,760
now but so let me un-show that but we

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,440
can just read it right so

01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,359
looking at the option for becoming a

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,520
member i see lots of avenues for things

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,599
like participation in ioc or the forums

01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,599
perform develop or perform development

01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,480
functions but not really any avenues for

01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,359
those of those

01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,040
who are technically inclined but as say

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,640
a system such infrastructure

01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,559
as engineers software developer who is

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,440
contributing packages to ubuntu

01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,440
so um

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,599
another software yeah exactly so as

01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,400
someone who is a systems engineer or

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,359
something like that

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,640
what avenues do you guys see as a way

01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,760
for those people to contribute

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,839
to to participate in these things

01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,599
uh dan do you want to go first yeah i'll

01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,000
go uh i think

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,880
certainly i think something that's not

01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
mentioned there

01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,359
but is important is the testing aspect

01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
uh certainly uh test

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,440
test things in in an upcoming release

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,680
that you would normally try

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,480
in you know maybe in a production

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,480
environment

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,559
and report you know bugs that you find

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,520
and all of those things are very

01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,359
valuable

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,680
i guess beyond that you know if you have

01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,799
any technical documentation

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,599
or even um

01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:25,440
changing changes to current technical

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,040
documentation that you find that

01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,359
you know you know maybe the process has

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,319
changed and you know things things of

01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,640
that nature

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,359
any of those contributions are certainly

01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,480
worthwhile

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:40,079
as well and

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,960
they aren't um you know they're they're

01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,079
technical

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,440
uh in in a way but they're not uh

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:50,480
writing code and i can understand that

01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,520
um writing code is would

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,359
be cause a lot of hesitation there if

01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,839
that's not something you do

01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,039
um but there's still a lot of

01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,440
opportunity

01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,920
there i think to contribute in a

01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,039
meaningful way

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:11,200
yeah there are really some old

01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:13,520
wiki pages uh without tools and

01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,720
that need to be reviewed that's a good

01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,640
thing to do

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:20,720
the just give feedback to the to the

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,319
to ubuntu about uh something that was

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,119
introduced into ubuntu

01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,599
and uh uh i need to know did we do this

01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,559
right

01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,599
we need to change tweak something for

01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,079
the future

01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,880
uh those sort of things and uh i'm

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,799
pretty sure that

01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,319
there are people in your community that

01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,359
take support

01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:42,720
that's a good way you can also

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:46,720
support the community or even just

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,359
help do some administration for your

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,160
local team and and to support some

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,640
events

01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,920
in technical ways there there are plenty

01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,119
of ways to

01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,359
to just go to ask ubuntu and answer some

01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,200
questions things like that

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,280
yeah and i think that one of the things

01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,839
i mean when you

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,799
gorion when you described what you were

01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,760
doing that

01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,960
what you were building on top of ubuntu

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,280
server

01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,039
and i think that they're actually from

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,480
the advocacy

01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:22,160
avenue there if you are you know

01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:25,920
kind of if you are showing and just

01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:29,200
highlighting what you're doing with this

01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,799
um i think that this also is an

01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,559
avenue that is pretty unique but

01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:39,760
also equally needed

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:41,119
and i really like this idea that the

01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,520
ways to contribute

01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,799
to a community that there are always

01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,359
these certain kind of core

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:50,799
things but then there are these ways to

01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:54,000
contribute that we might not have

01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:55,359
even thought of and so i think that's

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,200
one thing that are

01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:02,559
that the ubuntu community from the start

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,079
has always tried to do is it's like it's

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,799
not you know

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,000
contribution does not only equal

01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,119
development

01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,599
that there are all these other ways to

01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:13,839
contribute

01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,400
and they're not set it's like we we

01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:18,000
haven't closed the contribution cannon

01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,680
it's like okay these are the only ways

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,799
to contribute boom

01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:25,440
and so if you find something

01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,880
that kind of leans into your interest

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,520
and skills

01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,240
that is getting the word out about

01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,960
ubuntu

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,359
and could maybe help others kind of do

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,400
things

01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,920
similar to what you're doing on

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,960
server or whether it's things like my

01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,359
agrocates or iot and all these new

01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,799
aspects of our community

01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:50,079
and ken yay hi kent there's so many ways

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,839
to contribute and

01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,319
we're going to have all these new people

01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:57,359
doing

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,680
flutter which is going to again be you

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:02,160
know

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:05,920
a traditional role but a very new way of

01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,240
country a very new way of contributing

01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,079
and basically if you think about it are

01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:14,720
are you helping

01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:16,960
people use ubuntu or to learn about it

01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,240
and if you're doing you know if what

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,000
you're doing is

01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:25,280
tangent is doing one of those two things

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,280
and you're contributing

01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:31,760
eating basically and that includes

01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:35,039
all the flavors all the flav favors

01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:38,480
so ubuntu is a big tent

01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:40,720
yes yeah and

01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,520
just stuck yannick don't start a cult

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,520
please don't start it

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,200
i would join i'll join

01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:51,280
[Laughter]

01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,839
start a podcast ubuntu data center

01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,839
podcast

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,839
yep yeah cause we currently have what i

01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,799
know we have the

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,280
uh we have three ubuntu podcasts and

01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,640
then the

01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:09,039
ubuntu of the ubuntu security

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:12,160
podcast three but yeah

01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:15,440
um because there's yours the uk one

01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:18,960
and the and then the la

01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,960
and then the colla umbia

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:37,359
let's get some well i think that

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:41,760
clearly what we need to do is maybe

01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:41,760
have an episode with podcast people on

01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,039
diego we might be asking you to come on

01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,920
for a couple things just saying

01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,920
okay i'll turn i'm always looking into

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,200
the things

01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:58,880
yeah uh but yeah but there's

01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:01,599
but you know just contribute

01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,079
do kind of what speaks to your strengths

01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,640
and

01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,880
helps and helps people use ubuntu or

01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,000
helps people know a

01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,880
about it and i think that

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,160
reese we did have a discourse post about

01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,200
this about

01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,720
different ways to contribute we did let

01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,400
me go and finally we did

01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:24,559
there we go yes there it is

01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,079
and i see you guys posted the the link

01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,400
that i i had there from

01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,079
our manual about contributing you know

01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,160
in ubuntu as well

01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,119
so that's that's another good resource

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,359
to go

01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,640
to go read it's it's not all code

01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:40,720
there's a lot of other things

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:43,039
you can do um to help contribute

01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,720
and then also hopefully next year when

01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:48,319
we start to go back to

01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,880
in person stuff then we are

01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,319
looking to really kind of restart our

01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,520
community boost

01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:59,440
so if there is an open source

01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:01,920
um free and open source conference um

01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,640
event that you want to go to and you

01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,559
think man

01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,000
it would really make sense to have an

01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,640
ubuntu booth here

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,599
that is such a i mean you all saw the

01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,720
video from

01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,720
last week of with the with the the

01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,960
ubuntu france people having a

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:21,040
great time at a music conference so

01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,560
i mean really there's all kinds of

01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,480
places that

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:29,600
we can be in our communities to get to

01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,600
to get the word out

01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:35,199
definitely all right let's

01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,880
