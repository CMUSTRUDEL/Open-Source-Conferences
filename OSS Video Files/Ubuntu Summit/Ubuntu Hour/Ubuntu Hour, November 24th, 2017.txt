however not recently elected but nearly

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:25,180
for nearly two years I think is the one

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,400
who tells us to do

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:36,200
sorry you're the one who knows

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:40,880
everything yeah I tried and it's not as

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,800
easy you are not going to run away well

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,340
Nathan I thought of the count we will

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,450
need around and Nathan is even longer in

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,580
the council than me

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:59,930
so you should be the expert not me okay

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,750
since everybody coming it's always great

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,190
to see and it's always great to see new

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,240
people the idea here is to just make a

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:14,690
reunion in the community talk about

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,760
things that are happening if people from

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,210
the community have questions we try to

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,630
answer them and the idea is also to try

00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:26,450
to make this meeting in person so

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,760
there's a physical space where people

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,040
can go to if they want to get a good

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,880
result they are having problems with

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,880
their installation or if they want to

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,230
start contributing you take a chance and

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:47,600
out the idea is to have a friendly face

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:52,670
near by and well you're trying I am here

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,860
in hacker space so people in Costa Rica

00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:00,530
can come I think all of you are from

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,570
your house right we will try to make

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,510
this more in person

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:11,080
maybe next year or now we're just trying

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,080
to figure out the format and talking

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:23,500
so it's a bit hard to be anywhere except

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:26,650
um you know oh that's that that's one of

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,400
the things we need to figure out but you

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,770
shouldn't feel bounded by this time like

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,919
if you want to make your good power at a

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:39,190
different hour that's perfect and we can

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,620
give you the the links to do it on air

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:48,280
too if you want to or if you just want

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:50,740
to make it like off line that's valid

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,250
too it's one of the things that we are

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,470
discussing trying to figure out and well

00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:02,800
it's 11 so you can also do it in a bar

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:05,949
and work out the place that's also an

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,590
option we will definitely hear her that

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:15,009
way yeah we we at least want to have two

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:22,210
time zones this tension is good for the

00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:24,690
Americas and three of you are yeah sorry

if you want to jump ahead and do the

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,940
meeting at an earlier time a different

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,940

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,740
a thing with tried to do where we just

go out of our comfort zone and try to

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,750
make it visible that there's a lot of

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:05,620
people building this operating system

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,400
it's it's easy to just install it and

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,590
have it working by magic or having it

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,000
not working and blaming somebody who's

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:19,479
invisible behind the internet but on the

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,610

notice until yesterday that it's

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,520
probably in sync with and scheming it

Kyla are you the only one who celebrates

to say thanks yesterday or Monday you

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:47,720
can hit any time the idea is to

00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:50,990
start doing it more often right but that

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,180
was a nice thing that happened the other

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,550
thing that happened was that we finally

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,720
got that community council elected so

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,170
Walter why don't you tell us a little

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:08,540
about all the all the fun you had to

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:10,329
prepare the election yeah it's fun fun

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,029
that's what it was

00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:17,720
well after we being new community

00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:19,879
council members recognized that actually

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,389
it was a community council that elects

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,579
the delegation of the local council we

00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,199
made a little poll since I had already

00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:31,999
figured out how to make a poll for

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:39,079
everybody and and we finally got

00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:41,300
everybody everybody elected yes so the

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,709
thing is that we are also knew that

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,079
community council has just being elected

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:51,920
and we had no clue how to make an

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,680
election so we started figuring out what

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,459
really made the scripted a call the

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:04,509
emails from everybody and when we were

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:10,490
about to send that poll to what 600

00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:14,059
hundred we realized that that election

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,250
was not with the entire community was

00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:21,439
actually something that only the seven

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:24,649
members of the community council - so it

00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,089
was like week trying to figure out doing

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:35,709
the wrong thing then doing the right

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:38,899
team finally people got elected so when

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:42,529
you are aware on the community on the

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,529
local council for the past two years

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:50,809
tell us what still local and what's the

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:52,910
council and what stood the job so the

00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,900
local council is the counter for the

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,240
local community

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,790
water was also part of the local council

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,760
the last two years or more than two

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:08,810
years I think and the main thing what

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,840
the local council does is organizing or

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:15,170
helping local communities to help

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,290
organize the community and events which

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,260
are happening around the community for

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,900
example in our German community we

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:28,430
regularly organized Rubicon's

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,920
in Germany and in Europe and that the

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,760
thing watch the local council supports

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,820
and helps so that there's a healthy

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:46,550
local community around ubuntu in your

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:51,410

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,690
toasting about the plants already have

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:48,020
you met have you had your first meeting

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:51,590
no not yet unfortunately I think I was

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:54,320
thinking about something but um I'll

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:58,160
figure it out in the next days I still

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,620
have to to get used to it on me I think

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,650
I'll take some advice also from Sage

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,759
even there is experience if he can give

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,859
us some suggestions

00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,709
I'll probably get in contact with the

00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:15,879
Italian community and see what we can

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:20,949
figure out anyway I'm open to any

00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:23,649
suggestions it's my first first time you

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:30,059
know in a council server probably I'll

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:32,559
need some help yeah I just noticed that

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,829
sorry I just noticed that I was still

00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,720
subscribed to the local council agenda

00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,609
page which I'd recommend you subscribe

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,970
to if you don't and it looks like

00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:44,859
there's a bunch of rivera fication

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,459
requests happening on there so I think

00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:50,019
your your first few weeks as local

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,910
council members will be kind of busy

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,559
with that doing that and I think the

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,569
first thing we're gonna do is try to

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,059
move that process off the wiki and into

00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:02,410
the community hub following forgiven 3

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:04,839
there okay I saw there was also no board

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:09,089
if I'm not wrong there's a trailer board

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,439
with things to do or sing there no yeah

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,660
technically yes the I think the most

00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:19,480
recent thing from there is like 2013

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:25,869
2016 year it's not the right place to

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:29,739
looking no no so I'll have to look for

00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:34,480
the local council agenda first and see

00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:42,220
what's in there yeah suppose we have to

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:45,100
find also something new to do yeah we

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:54,850
already happening heritage complaint for

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:58,919
you so thanks also also noticing when to

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:02,289
say sorry and apparently we did it wrong

00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,589
in this position between that councils

00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:09,369
and there was a very nice team the local

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:12,339
in Arizona that was waiting for the

00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:15,339
re-verification and because we were

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:19,180
playing with Paul and we were having fun

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:22,570
making scripts to get

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:27,690
get emails we got late and then they

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:32,400
lost their their approved status so yeah

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,400
totally the first thing to do is to

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:42,550
sorry for that and it's a lot to the

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,180
people in in Arizona we should try to

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,270
sync

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:51,300
I think they are the only ones doing the

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:57,029
core hours every month for a long time

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,029
try to sync and have a few of them here

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,449
helping us I will make a note to contact

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:10,290
somebody and see if we can do it next

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:13,510
month hey Kyle are you excited

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:17,140
you were you were a proof that son won't

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:22,120
remember just in time yeah I'm I'm

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:23,559
jumping in quickly right I took my sweet

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,150
time getting like you've been to

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:39,790
membership I should have - long time ago

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:42,160
yeah yeah it's a lot we had some

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,520
problems making this production because

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,110
on the first call for candidates we got

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,679
one right

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:57,130
or maybe well for sure not enough to do

00:17:50,679 --> 00:18:00,370
the election so we had to redo the the

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:06,720
call and the second time we actually got

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:10,150
nine people the problem for the first

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,520
news what was only posted on on one

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:18,570
mailing this which actually looks like

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:21,460
no one waits or one little attempt to

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:26,950
post on the new community hub which is a

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:30,190
bit yes so we have to wait a few more

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,490
people and it helped a lot too - we

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:36,610
stuff the local counter

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:40,750
yeah so thanks thanks also to the other

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:44,679
poor candidates who are not elected for

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:49,120
this for this time they can reapply to

00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,320
many other councils in two hour to two

00:18:49,120 --> 00:19:02,080
years when the term for this one ends

00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:04,690
but we hope to see them around and as as

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,880
you said a lot of things are changing

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:13,330
the mailing lists are almost empty and

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,669
the community hub is driving so it's

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,779
like a whole new generation if you see

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:23,320
at the most popular posts in there they

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:26,380
have a thousand views and they have 50

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,090
comments going on there's there's people

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,919
doing a lot of interesting things well

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,950
there's the election is happening in

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,690
there the planning for these meetings

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:39,100
and before the council meetings are

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:41,769
happening in there but also they are

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,169
developing a new flavor of Ubuntu in

00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,779
dirt they are planning or the unity

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,659
flavor they are deciding if they want to

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:52,840
release it in April or in October and

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:56,350
there's a lot of new things to do

00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:00,100
there's people writing the new official

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:03,690
team for Ubuntu which from the looks of

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,889
it from the excitement that everybody is

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:13,330
so everybody is showing in the hub I

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:21,549
think it will be ready for it shiny new

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:25,019
look right then do you know what that

00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:29,500
software has mobile apps or is it just

00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:34,600
sign in on your phone type of thing well

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,389
while yours yes

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,779
I believe there is a discourse mobile

00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:42,789
app I looked in the list before but you

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,559
know though the web interface is so

00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:45,580
mobile friendly had anyone really

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,040
bothered

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,280
it just makes me think of like this

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,380
jacket exchange platform you know and

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,670
it's nice to get notifications sometimes

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:59,650
right right right I'll see if I can

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:03,430
track that down and make a post about it

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:06,790
yeah that would be handy thank you yeah

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:13,230
I was expecting it just to work like my

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,230
day but it's not something I use

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:27,520
question and we haven't touched a low so

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,670
why don't you tell us what's exciting on

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,950
the studio oh you're being pretty quiet

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,990
actually I actually have to take you a

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,170
couple of months it's break from it so

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm actually just coming back

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,540
sorry I haven't actually been doing a

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,780
lot I think it was been mostly bug

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,570
fixing and you know just continuing the

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,930
ongoing projects there isn't that menu

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,370
takes me but hey if you want to help out

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:56,440
volunteer we always need more volunteers

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,700
that's all I'm gonna say on this sorry

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm not going to be listening you guys

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,790
I'm like you know I'm being quiet but

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,110
that's okay

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:10,090
I haven't seen a lot of participation

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:13,090
from the window studio on the hop so let

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:16,590
me go there there's apparently a lot of

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,590
eager people to contribute

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:30,310
we have Simon now hello Simon

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:33,640
no we are kind of talking about we have

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:36,580
been doing everybody in the past month

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,290
so why don't you tell us about all the

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:49,710
stuff you maintain you know how is it

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:49,710
going I can't hear you don't hear you

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:08,169
yep it was Paulus audio right so I've

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,679
just been working on a couple different

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:16,870
things a couple different Lubuntu things

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:24,429
and you know it's it's kind of explained

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:31,059
but yeah we have we have a question here

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:33,760
on the chat from and for sking something

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:37,360
like that what pieces should i download

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,690
to be ready for google code-in for which

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,880
variants of two there will be tasks so

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,909
maybe we can use this to talk a little

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:54,220
about the coding this is an event for

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:59,380
students from 13 to 17 years old all

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:02,980
over the world do you do it online we

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:09,520
have also a lot of mentors so if you are

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:13,990
not young like us I think not even Simon

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,020
advice anymore for or the coding if you

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,210
are not Joan anymore so there's no

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,929
reason to suffer it can be a mentor and

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:26,020
start spreading all the know--let's

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:28,809
earned on these years I think Carla is

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:35,650
going to be a mentor called Simon I

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:41,440
think Walter sure are you mentors I love

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,490
I'm not this year I believe so I'm still

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,840
like this is the first time I'm

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,840
observing this so I'm going to actually

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,840
see what's happening with yeah

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,640
I think - answer me answer the actual

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,280
question here I mean I think we have a

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,260
number of tasks between both Lubuntu

00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,910
itself and and Simon you have little bit

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,750
do specific ones as well I assume you

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,790
know yeah I have a couple different a

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,400
couple different Lubuntu stuff plus

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,800
there's like the packaging guide that

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,929
I'd also like to get some work on done

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,890
so yeah it's a couple different things

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:27,790
maybe something for the moons weekly

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:31,110
newsletter it all depends so about this

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:33,730
is to download there's no one to

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,010
participating Kubuntu will be

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:40,360
participating in o matic you'll be

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:43,929
participating but you can always switch

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,130
the flavor with the command so can you

00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:52,510
stall any one and there will be tasks

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:55,390
for people to do I stay up here so if

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:58,660
you want to be a mentor please go to the

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:03,370
hub right now because we need a lot of

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:06,429
tasks to be ready and the contest starts

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:10,090
on twitter student you will be able to

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:16,710
register next Tuesday the 28th of

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:20,890
November the site is code in dot with

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:23,200
google.com but more information under

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:27,040
hop or whatever you can always leave a

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:33,850
comment in any of the Ubuntu channels

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:37,420
and people will guide you there there

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:39,730
will be many different kinds of tasks

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,150
and particularly interested in

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:47,200
translations so I'm eager to work with

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:49,390
students who speak English and any other

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:56,559
language we need to do a lot of

00:26:49,390 --> 00:27:00,160
translations to Spanish the one we find

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:04,900
people who speaks your language and are

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,440
eager to participate to some of the

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,139
tasks

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,090
I felt our for translating the tutorials

00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:14,070
which is a new cool thing that we are

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:17,220
doing parents spirit being very useful

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:20,769
but they are only in English there's one

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:26,830
tutorial in French that's only because

00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:28,600
the babies is in France a lot more than

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,159
we just to make sure that everybody can

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:43,570
get started with - even if they don't

00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:46,980
speak English in doing tasks yeah I was

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:51,250
muted and yes I'm fielding test for

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:57,399
testing for testing I chose packages and

00:27:51,250 --> 00:28:00,759
laptop testing YES on the QA side for

00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,590
carrying out some tests I didn't fill in

00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:06,759
much more but I think there's a lot to

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:10,120
doing know they're on the ID tracker and

00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:12,610
on the package tracker so I filled up

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:20,860
those tasks have you got any ideas I can

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:25,179
add something I I didn't think this true

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:27,429
when I fill up my vacations so I've been

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,929
feeling a lot of tasks but I'm holidays

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:37,450
the first day of the contest so Kyle

00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:39,250
will probably be totally yeah especially

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,720
with the translation stuff like if you

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:47,139
speak any language there's no problem

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:49,240
you know I was thinking that Karla you

00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:53,110
you can probably help a lot than the

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:59,470
tasks I feel about making snaps oh yes

00:28:53,110 --> 00:29:02,980
ok snaps to get started it would be nice

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,460
to to figure out the translation stuff

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:10,240
but I still need to finish the tasks I

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,179
will let you know I will not just run

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,440
away image you need me to deal with the

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:18,240
mess if you need translations in Italian

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:24,030
try

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:28,110
always and probably there will be

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,120
Italian students and yeah yeah sort of

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,490
in a in a similar vein you know why we

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,600
should all be spending time adding tasks

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,550
and trying to fill those out as much as

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,590
possible I think it's important to to

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,350
reach out to your local high schools you

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,150
know I have been emailing principles and

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,910
and curriculum leads instead of trying

00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,960
to actually get students involved trying

00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:54,960
to get away to sell lots people have

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:57,240
never heard of this sorry good question

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,490
is there information available in other

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,160
languages for the code in itself or is

00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:10,860
it just English great question no idea

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:12,450
yeah no like one of the requirements one

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,350
of the requirements this year is going

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,540
to be that you need to speak English

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,670
because a lot of that a lot of the

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,510
materials are only in English but if we

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:29,640
translate many of the materials next

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:32,090
year we can I guess at this point it

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,559
depends on your mentor like if you are

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:39,950
Italian

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:42,990
Carla will guide you through if you I

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:46,200
can and circa has just been me saying

00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:50,650
that he's also a mentor so I don't have

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,689
to vote living tile along I forgot sir

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,689
[Music]

00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:05,120
you speak German you cut out

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:12,179
sweetie bun are you here with us I was

00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:17,250
wondering if you speak German if you can

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:20,480
help us with I actually never

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,250
contributed to the German translations

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,730
so I don't know how the process what

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:29,129
that is but I made pings of one of the

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:32,279
friends who are active in the

00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:38,460
translations and saying hey go and help

00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:40,019
them as a mentor that's great and it

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,470
doesn't really matter that you haven't

00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,190
done it because like translating

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,620
launchpads

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,929
it's one thing there are already teams

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,500
in there but when troubles is

00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:54,929
translating everything else like making

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,149
sure that the hub is multi-language not

00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:03,720
making sure that that tutorials are

00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:07,169
multi-language that's not something we

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,379
have a process for we are also now doing

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:14,840
a lot of videos video guides for snap

00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:17,580
crafts and they're only in English but

00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,899
part of these tasks is to figure out a

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:27,419
process of how to do it documented in

00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:30,840
make it easier people next the next set

00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:36,980
of students that come what is your

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:44,039
language hello Turkish English French

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:47,100
yeah so those three yep Oh exactly what

00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,320
we were looking for you have a dumb

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,190
translation before but recently so um

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,350
yeah I've been doing more design stuff I

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,659
might be able to mentor next year just

00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,620
like I'm not even to member yet so

00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:03,360
trying to see what's happening but yeah

00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,570
I definitely will be a good idea to

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,279
reach sustain this year there is an open

00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,679
source community in Turkey but it is

00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,119
actually mostly you know focused on

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,799
translation there's a lot of students

00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,299
who are encouraged but it's happens

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,780
mostly in university level not so much

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,820
in high school that I know of

00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:26,750
not that I have that many contacts in

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:30,920
high school so you are preparing for us

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:38,840
the designed to make the invitation it's

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:41,060
a nice drawing you already showed me I'm

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:56,270
not going to risk the screenshot here

00:33:41,060 --> 00:34:03,310
but let me see if I can alright this is

00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:03,310
the one we just need to add text yep so

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,970
wait

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:12,050
and that's tweet that do you use create

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,430
a POJO Jones yeah well there is

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,440
beautiful options in this case at the

00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,830
critter was the MOOCs the one that made

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,660
sense um because it was just faster to

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,920
draw it as a raster than a vector

00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,680
drawing um

00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,820
just waiting for it though but yeah so

00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,090
I'm going to actually put that in

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,100
Scribus another open source software to

00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,540
add the text and I just yeah um you gave

00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,880
me actually one draft those tags I just

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,410
know yeah just I'll probably get it done

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,080
tonight to you and I'll get them I send

00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:41,080
it somewhere to community how I guess

00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm a stupid question what is what is

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,180
the difference if we're talking vector

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,230
graphics between Peter and Knicks game

00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh

00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,750
Inkscape is for vector graphics and

00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,670
Krista is actually for like rester for

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,790
oh good it's not vector hope you okay

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,700
yeah um so but yeah it's just easier to

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:07,030
draw in Krita um in this case because I

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:13,330
was drawing it in my Chrome tablet so

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:13,330
yeah okay you draw this by hand with are

00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:24,590
destroyed by overcome tablet on the

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:27,920
computer it was like oh you're still

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:31,480
owing us that that session where you

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,480
teach us how to do

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:44,080
remember okay I haven't forgotten we can

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,550
do it maybe next month whenever you have

00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,500
actually that would be that would be

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:51,160
super interesting like a short short

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,860
series of videos or tutorials on open

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,130
source art basically there are some

00:35:53,860 --> 00:36:00,030
really good tutorials on Rita and there

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,820
are tutorials on lighting the Inkscape

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,170
not so much for a lot of other things um

00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,970
it's been on my to-do list for a very

00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:11,230
long time to do like our trade open

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:13,510
source based tutorials it's just yet

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,000
last six months obvious yeah well I mean

00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,440
and and I agree like it's actually not

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,930
too hard to learn those tools by

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,780
themselves but if you actually look at a

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:25,300
project that you go through I would

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,980
expect you use multiple programs to go

00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,410
through a process right I mean like

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,440
thanks for photography my wife uses dark

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,910
table and then [ __ ] but you can find

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,650
dark tip of tutorials you can find new

00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,530
tutorials but actually finding some that

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,460
goes through the entire workflow is a

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,590
little bit more difficult to find

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,110
actually I'm going to plug in here that

00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:48,090
there is a site called pixels actually I

00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,090
was just saying except for one cycle

00:36:53,580 --> 00:37:00,100
like I know I've been posting over arch

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,420
on my salon but thank you like always

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,070
the idea of like putting also

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,610
information on how to do this as a whole

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:10,330
workflow is just yeah um volunteering in

00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,670
time yeah it will happen before next

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:16,450
year

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:19,510
well you'll definitely have viewers all

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:24,490
right okay get your wife Kyle to teach

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:27,330
his death table do-gooder gonna the

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:33,850
website she's saying what is it hey gix

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:39,850
el us that's so hard to remember what is

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:42,960
it oh yes move on he iooks LS that us oh

00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,960
yes thank you okay

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,250
great series of blog posts tutorials

00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,690
articles and then they have a discourse

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,720
instance there as well for asking

00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,940
questions with a number of different

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,329
photography software that's I mean the

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,520
ones I've seen there our dark table

00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:07,500
there's either rah-rah therapy I think

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,910
there's a [ __ ] category on there as well

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,589
really smart people good community

00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,540
there's a lot of people who are there

00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:18,150
who are actually developers for a [ __ ]

00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,980
and I don't know how my start table is

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,579
checking but Terrell champion I think

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,069
[ __ ]

00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:26,460
developers are there too so there's also

00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:28,079
and you can load their forum there we

00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,000
are kind of going off topic but so I

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,460
mean you this is also a good place where

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,849
develop developers and of the software

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,930
and user tough meat

00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:42,599
nothing's off topic for this this is

00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:44,190
exactly what this is and they actually

00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,220
do have an I think they have a section

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,500
for artists so it's not that we are not

00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,810
welcome so else I do photography too but

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,430
yeah I've been like lurking around they

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,619
definitely do have a section for artists

00:38:53,430 --> 00:39:06,359
now but yeah it's primarily for

00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:10,670
photography well precisely that's the

00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,589
last topic in my agenda for today that's

00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:17,670
what to do for the agenda of the next

00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:21,510
meeting like Kyle said nothing is off

00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,500
topic but we need to structure it a

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,060
little better

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,910
Walter already suggested to have a Q&A

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:34,619
the problem is that we need first people

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:36,510
to ask questions and then you might get

00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,940
you might consider that being an offline

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,430
process may be announced the went to our

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,200
ahead of like you know a week or two

00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,060
ahead of time and say we're gonna have a

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,340
Q&A session line your questions up here

00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,340
and we'll go through them

00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,430
yeah we kind of did it on the hop but

00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:58,380
well problem again it's like we are

00:39:53,430 --> 00:40:02,160
starting out a lot of things now and we

00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,200
already have some people here well we

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,840
have a lot of a lot more people like

00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:12,120
than I expected what's working very

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:15,630
nicely and we get a decent amount of

00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,810
viewers now we need to encourage them to

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:21,990
participate and to get more people so

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:25,770
yeah QA sounds great

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,530
maybe for the next time I can start it a

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,450
couple of weeks before or I'm not sure

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,940
if two weeks is a lot and then people

00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,520
will forget yes

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:39,420
actually permit maybe maybe a week is

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,520
okay next time I can if you post it on

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,150
the haibach and then post it on the

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,190
Italian mailing lists so also to get

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,310
some Italian people involved of the

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,870
entire community

00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:54,360
Richard's on the on the live shot on

00:40:51,870 --> 00:41:04,050
YouTube saying to post me out on the

00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:05,970
Iguchi podcast plus people on massive on

00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,620
we can actually if they can't get the

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,570
information early enough we can talk to

00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:15,390
those people and they can help us boost

00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:16,920
take boost it sorry and it's great yeah

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,160
and why don't you are ear

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,980
I mean Alba suit but also like you know

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,170
there's quite a few people on there like

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,950
there are writers who are on open-source

00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:32,300
comm blog etc so if we ask their help

00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,300
they might be able to boost that too

00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:38,340
yeah and there's also mailing list we

00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,960
can put it on and I guess like some

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:44,790
people actually still read the forum's

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,970
too so there's that so it's great that

00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:53,610
you're here because I can't do all of

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:56,760
that alone so for the next one that's I

00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:59,730
will prepare a post-op and and I will be

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,060
bothering you to help me spreading the

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:06,660
word

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:09,270
the word yeah everywhere and well a QA

00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,770
it's very nice it's something that we

00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:18,060
used to do before let's do that to start

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:21,240
and then maybe like we do stop randomly

00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,390
about the things that we are working on

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,280
or the things that happen but I was

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:31,380
thinking that maybe we can finish with

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:35,630
somebody is showing something how to do

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:38,760
something in a nice free program or

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:42,780
something basic how to install Ubuntu

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:49,140
for people that's joining I don't know

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:53,760
maybe we can have a different topic what

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,950
would you like to see next month maybe

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,820
we could teach how to taste

00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:04,050
icers tai detestable - on the creator

00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:09,110
and so we can get someone involved in

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:11,910
yay I like that idea

00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,750
do you want to do it do you want to do

00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:20,340
it next month

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:26,190
oh I can try huh

00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:28,140
you see what happens first time Walter

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:32,010
and Karla will take care of that you see

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:39,150
we should meet more often we always get

00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:41,700
a lot of things done and that's it with

00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:45,090
my agenda is there something you would

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:48,660
like to talk about I will shut up for

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:53,070
now my throat already hurts I don't

00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:56,060
usually talk so this is being a lot

00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,060
wants to

00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:20,960
I was I was wondering if one of you have

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:25,090
plans in the near future to organize a

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:32,270
meeting in person a la Cour not a

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:35,480
University all right I don't think I do

00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:39,320
but I know that our logo has been doing

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:47,030
one like every other week in Salem

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:50,510
Oregon for years I can contact me tell

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:53,900
you community see if there that would do

00:44:50,510 --> 00:45:01,810
so also I can just get in touch and

00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:05,360
figure out they think we should stink

00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:13,340
lists whatever works for them or split

00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:15,560
it into more than one you must see how

00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,270
many people we get maybe if there are a

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,100
lot of people you can split it otherwise

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:23,140
if you're a few people we can do one

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,140
should figure out how many we officed

00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,160
alright so next month is a little

00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:43,790
complicated

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:46,310
no it's the same everybody's in theory

00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,800
the meeting should be on the 22nd of

00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:52,520
December but do you think it's is it too

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,280
late should we know it earlier I will be

00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,000
South Africa from the 22nd of December

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,810
to the 8th of January so I'll be away in

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:13,580
the Christmas period so I won't be able

00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:15,560
to be there I think you should do it we

00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,319
can always stop following the rules and

00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:22,219
do it some other day

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:27,919
well you think about the 15 that could

00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:38,749
be 10 to 20 seconds to near Christmas

00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:43,400
maybe people go on holiday Friday the

00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:49,849
15th anybody wanting to suggest an

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:53,479
alternative or is it fit for you should

00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:59,119
do it maybe we should do it there

00:46:53,479 --> 00:47:07,189
because Kylie's is our citibank and and

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:09,679
Carla are the leftover turkey say you

00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:20,390
are not feeling good last night I feel

00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:35,919
better now okay so maybe the 15th an

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:38,749
hour I will make a proposal in there and

00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:40,969
feel free to disagree and propose a

00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:43,939
different hour if we agree on a

00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:46,429
different hour we we just move

00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:52,489
everything if we can't agree we just

00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:54,739
split probably there will be a lot of

00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:57,799
interesting people to talk about next

00:47:54,739 --> 00:48:00,079
month because we will have the first

00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:07,719
