00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:42,869
in it better to to see how it works as I

00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:45,359
just arrived but patient or good we're a

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,579
little we are running a little here a

00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,049
little disoriented because I started to

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,049
call like five minutes

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:15,510
yeah I'd hear what you said last thing

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:18,620
who goes next Christmas I'm I'm in Chris

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,760
glass from the from the Swiss local team

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,040
tonight we were supposed to join as a

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,269
local team but unfortunately it was

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,299
canceled because too many people had

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:32,430
other other real life thanks to suet and

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:37,370
so we decided to reconvene and it was

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,370
too late to notify you guys Oh Here I am

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,969
yeah I guess tonight it would be nice to

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,840
talk about communication channels and

00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:53,879
how you guys at least for me how you how

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,709
you I don't know how do you promote your

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,659
your meetup and events in general

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,310
because I feel using your own mailing

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,090
list was maybe not as successful as it

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,299
could have been so yeah a great topic

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,280
thanks for coming anyway well that's the

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,120
idea of this space because you will see

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,150
here four members from different local

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:20,340
teams and well Marcus to that's a

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:24,030
community that's not a local and the

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,049
idea is to get together and start moving

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,010
our local events and see if more people

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:35,849
arrive to the real-life

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:39,030
site of ours so yeah let's talk about it

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:44,489
and Chris is also developer on the boon

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,540
to foundations team so he will have some

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,439
interesting things

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,329
tell us about if you have questions the

00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,549
people who are watching this from home

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,469
you can just throw your questions and we

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,129
will try to answer them if you are

00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:02,969
watching from Ubuntu on air.com there's

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:06,389
a box below the video that's an IRC chat

00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,280
we are monitoring it so we have

00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,730
something to say if you have something

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,819

more local events and we need to share

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,910

everybody just trying to work together

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:54,840
and make a consistent operating system

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:57,820
that it's free and works for the world

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,549
thanks really

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,000
we can go back to talk about this if

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:07,090
there are more questions but I'm looking

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,510
on IRC that we are starting to have

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:13,870
people and it's also an interesting mix

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:17,650
in there we have bhai from Armenia we

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:22,210
have wheeled from Brazil and Rick from

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:24,100
Israel and so welcome welcome to the

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:29,740
community if you're new thanks a lot for

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:34,330
joining and by asked how he can join the

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,370
team well that's like not so simple

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,880
question to answer because there are

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:43,470
many many things it depends on what's

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,419
your interest but I think the the

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,720
easiest way to get started is to find

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:52,120
somebody from your local community team

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,850
so let's go to Karla

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,580
why don't you tell behave

00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:03,160
what the local communities are and how

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:05,830
he can join he or she can join well

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,340
usually yes as you said it depends what

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:13,000
a person would like to do so if one just

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,790
one is is keen to social things socially

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,290
means he can you can join the marketing

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:23,970
team or other of the local and might be

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:26,920
writes write something on a boom to

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,810
maybe if someone likes to develop you

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:35,200
can join the developers team and try to

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:38,470
write something there are a lot of

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,010
projects in Ubuntu if you want to start

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,930
all four basic you can stop testing

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,570
testing is a nicer place to start off

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,940
because you tried things they need to

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,280
only find bugs and at the same time you

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:57,130
learn a lot and from testing then you

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:59,410
can probably go on to development it

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,110
just depends on what a person likes and

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,560
then get in contact with the local team

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:09,910
and for sure that you'll find someone

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,860
that can tell you what there is what

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,880
project is to work on if you want to

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,980
work on snaps or can't think of other

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,240
things now cause I've been at for quite

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,430
a long time but this just you just have

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,290
to choose what you prefer doing and ask

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:30,210
to your local team and you should for

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:33,550
sure you will get you'll get in

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,110
indications a way to start off it's not

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,330
a problem we will find a place for

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:42,220
everyone we meet a lot of people that's

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,300
easy to find them

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:50,260
that is how did you start please excuse

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:54,370
me I can't I couldn't hear you copy the

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:57,520
voice went away Aditi what'd you say aha

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,260
I started sorry I didn't hear the

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,350
question because the voice went away

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,980
uh-huh I started off oh that's

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,750
interesting

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,380
I just I meet a guy from any telling guy

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,170
from the

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:15,790
to community and he was doing

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:17,650
translations and he introduced me to the

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,890
world of a boot he told me about you boo

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,050
to community and what they did and I

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,260
started off with translations but I

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:30,340
don't like translating so I lived that

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:34,720
and I preferred to go tasting I started

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:38,770
with this QA and I started tasting live

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,930
USB keys butl of USB keys and then from

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,780
that I ordered some kernel testing

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:48,280
whatever I found some cool food tastings

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:51,570
I just popped in and tested and tell

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,460
told my results on the mailing list and

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:58,260
then luckily I had the fortune to go to

00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:03,460
the last UTS that was in Copenhagen and

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:06,910
that was where I made a lot of people

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:11,680
and it was really great and from there I

00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:14,560
mean I essentially been in testing and I

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,440
had the opportunity to know Nicolas

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,190
Nicolas cakes that introduced me to

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:27,970
automate tic automation automation sorry

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:32,650
I got stuck automatic testing with auto

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:35,170
pilot and I started writing tests for

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:39,490
the for Bluetooth phone for the collapse

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:41,530
of the Ubuntu phone at the time and I

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,770
enjoyed myself a lot

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,360
then I allow I got I had to leave for a

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,890
period because I had some problems so

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,390
now I'm coming back and I've been there

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,280
still for enough for a bit of time but

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,880
on I'm still trying to figure out what

00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:04,030
what I can do now but essentially I just

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,490
answered to go for tastings that I found

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,610
on their mailing lists or subscribe to

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:15,760
the mailing lists and that's that's how

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:19,330
I got into the - boom - so the community

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,840
I mean you have been doing a lot of work

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,840

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:36,400
well as a Satanist it's just a question

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,790

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,950
everything is is ok I mean just do what

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:46,500

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:55,500
translations and testing and love

00:24:51,270 --> 00:25:00,870
translations I really enjoy translating

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:04,390
- is a little twist on - but that's

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:07,780
dictated and I still try to contribute

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:12,610
that there are many things in progress

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:16,030
that needs help from translators if you

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:18,850
speak English in any other language just

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,600
let us know and we will have tons and

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,560

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:43,270
cool project I won't if you want to

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,880
translate this you need to learn a lot

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:50,970
about containers and security and very

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,180
cool it's in progress there are a lot of

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:57,520
untranslated strings there so let us

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:07,690

will make the announcement here - a

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:19,420
couple I'm working on the snap craft

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:21,940
project which new software into the

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,120
Windows Store and other Linux

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,490
distributions very easily and we need a

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,890
lot of hands to test all these new

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,710
projects that are getting into the store

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,739
we have different channels so the early

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,359
adopters are really

00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:41,539
testers that really enjoy taking a lot

00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:45,320
of risk can install the snaps from the

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:49,219
edge channel and they will be updated

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,440
like once a day or even more with the

00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:55,099
things that recently landed on the

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,559
upstream projects so you will get an

00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,719
early view of what's going to come

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,719
what's going to be released in one month

00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:06,049
or two months you will get a chance to

00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:09,559
sweet ship very early pine box in there

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,809
affect the project directly like with

00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,319
your reports the developers will know if

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:18,589
they are doing a good job or they need

00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:21,709
to program you before being able to

00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:23,929
release it and you can also jump into

00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:27,969
fixing those box or taking a look at

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:31,879
what the product does and see what what

00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:34,190
we have a lot of calls for testing and

00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:36,679
we have been sending them through the

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:46,609
Twitter account that's we want to test

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:48,529
in Twitter that they're not so in

00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:51,589
progress we happy what to do what to

00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:53,989
test how to report and you can talk to

00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:58,149
the maintainer to the developers if you

00:27:53,989 --> 00:28:04,999
have questions so yes you will be

00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:07,269
welcome there bye I interrupted you oh

00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:09,979
no I interrupted you I thought you were

00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:12,079
sorry I just want to add on the on the

00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:14,059
testing fronts that so my team at

00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,349
economical builds cloud images and

00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,009
that's also something that you can very

00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:21,440
easily help test by simply spinning up

00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:23,539
likes tea containers and so usually we

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,579
hopefully we do a good a good job to

00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:28,309
find all the quirks beforehand with

00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:31,369
automatic testing but it's it's nice to

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:34,129
have people actually tires on some of

00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:36,559
them in particular recently we have

00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:39,319
we've changed vagrants images as well so

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,019
if you if you if somebody out there

00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,459
wants to kick the tires on the on the

00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,200
vagrant images that we released that

00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:46,700
would be great because there's many

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,519
images that we release but these were

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,769
these in particular mites

00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,379
I need the eyes of somebody who's more

00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:53,739
used to using vagrants so that would be

00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:56,139
great

00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:58,419
there's there's plenty of absolutely

00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:00,869
everywhere it's a it's basically the

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:06,519
most important thing we do I think so

00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:08,649
making sure I would wait - sorry a good

00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,229
way to get started would be to go to the

00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:14,529
community hub that's community doctor go

00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:16,599
to the come and make a post saying hi or

00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:20,979
reply to one of the things that are

00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:26,079
happening in there a lot of projects in

00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:29,769
progress especially because coastal is

00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:33,249
set we have the release for eight very

00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:35,889
soon and this is going to be an LTS this

00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:38,619
is a release that's supported for a lot

00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:44,589
of years so it needs to be very well

00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:49,929
tested to be very stable doing our part

00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:52,570
in there we welcome and Chris we talked

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:55,769
briefly that you were in a rush on the

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:58,059
previous weeks because of some

00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:02,309
interesting not funny

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:04,629
yeah yes because of the whole Intel

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,209
spectral and nail down problems

00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:10,209
so my team is not obviously the first in

00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:12,070
line so that's my my colleagues and and

00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:14,619
members of the community from the kernel

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,659
team that were really on the first line

00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,549
of the fence to try to patch and and

00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:21,190
make sure that all the Ubuntu

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:24,389
installations are safe so they really

00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,219
were to a lot and did a great job

00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:29,049
so to land those fixes in the and and

00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:31,029
all of the boon the kernels and that's

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,309
there's quite a lot of them when you

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,859
consider the some some of the kernels

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,690
that we use in the clouds and the older

00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:39,909
car the hardware enable enablement

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,700
kernels on top of the regular streams of

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:45,969
kernels that normal desktop users would

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,369
use but once they they managed to land

00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:50,529
those patches my or team the found the

00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,059
Foundation's team has to as to make sure

00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:54,309
that the cloud images all the cloud

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,299
images or or patched and up-to-date as

00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:01,760
possible so that people spinning up new

00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:06,170
new virtual machines don't get

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,830
remain vulnerable for long so so yeah we

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,810
we've been quite busy with notifying all

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,780
of our partners and varios called

00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:19,120
providers so it was it was an

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,120
interesting set of weeks so thanks until

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:39,770
you have a new new common newcomer

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:42,170
Marcin hi hi I'm from Poland and is

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:48,160
participating in google code-in this

00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:52,340
year oh great twice one of our top

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:55,070
students during the mountain coding how

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,910
many tasks did you complete that's

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:01,700
amazing 32 whoa

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:11,390
good job 42 and that's a great number as

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:13,280
well thanks really it was a fun app only

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,910
thing to participate on the Google

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,070
coding but many people don't know what

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,190
that is why don't you make a summary

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:24,470
merci

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:29,270
what happened what some of the tasks

00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:37,520
that interests you the most what did you

00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:51,560
think about the experience my internet

00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:52,230
connection I can't hear in any way you

00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:01,590
can

00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:04,890
can paint I will I will make the summary

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:08,820
in doom arsenal free to chime in

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:15,860
interrupt me whenever you want to share

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,860
something Google organises an event

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:27,540
December January with students from 13

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:29,910
to 17 years old and they invites free

00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:34,740
software communities to serve as mentors

00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:36,630
for these young new contributors so I

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,380
want to participate and the other

00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:44,640
organizations I think 25 in total there

00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:49,160
was like Wikimedia in Drupal and a lot

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:52,049
of a lot of nice projects out there we

00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,770
asked who wanted to be mentors in there

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:59,120
I think

00:33:52,770 --> 00:34:03,419
Karla was part of the mentors - yeah

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,030
and for Venters front from one - from

00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:11,580
all the areas of Ubuntu there was

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:15,990
desktop servers are 15 UI snack craft

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:21,359
and snaps and in the end we finished

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:23,639
like 700 tasks more than 700 together

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,359
with a lot of students from all over the

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:31,830
world there was translations - it was

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,310
very nice for us because it it's very

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:38,369
good to test our processes like how easy

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,169
it is for newcomers to join Ubuntu and

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,889
we learned a lot of things that we need

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:49,020
to improve it was also a nice exercise

00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:52,800
to split your tasks between things that

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,800
can a new person can do immediately in a

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,640
couple of hours means that it will take

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,609
some experience and somebody will be

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,070
able to do in a week or so and things

00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:06,090
that are more complicated so we also had

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,410
a lot of work

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:14,700
in our own stock we have never-ending

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:17,220
stream of backlogged tasks so it's good

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,280
to slow down like take a look what's

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:25,260
more important what can happen quickly

00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:30,510
and of the result was amazing like I

00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:33,690
think there are 10 new snaps ready to be

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:39,120
published and other snaps were already

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:53,040
published during the during the contest

00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:55,500
and many 10 more are in pro hey sorry

00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm you cuz I didn't realize it was you

00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:06,500
I miss much it was a mistake I thought

00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,500
yeah sorry sorry about that

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:21,690
there was some some pickup on the on the

00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:23,550
lines oh yes that is summary 30 new

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,160
applications ready for all the booth

00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:32,970
users just to find them in the Windows

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:39,210
Store that was pretty cool and mark mark

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:45,930
mercy you did like five like that right

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:50,160
do you have a favorite one probably the

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:55,380
crypto which one just because it seems

00:36:50,160 --> 00:37:01,290
pretty bad material but is very useful

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:04,620
for the miners so you know I'm one of

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:09,180
the snaps it's called crypto watch so

00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:12,540
you can like follow the ups and downs of

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,690
many cryptocurrencies which is a crazy

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,880
world at this moment

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,770
Marcy package Tipton published it and

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,630
it's now featured on the

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:27,530
page of snap craft at i/o so it's

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:30,870
getting a lot of installs if you have

00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:35,820
boxes to report for Marcin you can do it

00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:39,770
in the forum or in the repo and if you

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,980
have bit requests if you to add more

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:46,980
applications also there's as we have

00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,870
been saying a lot there's a lot of

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,640
things to do there's a lot of different

00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:56,370
areas where people to enjoy so great

00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,430
it's it's good to joint Marcin because I

00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:02,150
was about to forget about this the

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:08,670
winners of the contest will be announced

00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:15,470
next week next Wednesday I think

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,470
and like every student who participated

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,680
yeah every student who participated will

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,600
get a shirt I think the mentors we also

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:29,010
get dressed by the by the contest and

00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,930
winners there will be two winners per

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:38,550
organization who will get a trip to

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:42,870
Google headquarters which I hope we will

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:46,110
do this again next year but if you want

00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:51,450
to join right now we still have asks

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:54,150
that were left remaining some thanks

00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:57,000
everybody who participated it was really

00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:04,620
intense like they have a lot of energy

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,900
it was very hard to follow them what

00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:10,640
what were your tasks Carla did you

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:16,170
mentor some of this contributors

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:19,220
yes well essentially I entered the

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:23,340
testing on the starting of a punto

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:27,000
Bhutto on a pcs or they stops or theater

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:29,490
or virtual machines so the QA part and

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,980
yes there there were a lot of tasks and

00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,270
it was quite difficult to keep up with

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,760
everyone

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,210
and then essentially I just hang down to

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,380
to the testing testing in any stalling

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:46,170
of a pollutant so I didn't have very

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:54,660
much time but a little time I had I

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:57,360
dedicated to that well but for the

00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:01,320
students they all they were very live

00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:05,120
and interested so I haven't got any

00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:08,730
preference but they're all very good

00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,370
there there was a very nice task at it

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,010
at the end and it was about signing the

00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,940
code of conduct we talked about this on

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,950
the previous two hour and it's also an

00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:24,740
amazing way to get started

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:28,320
Ubuntu we try to be nice to each other

00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:32,820
talking between cultures between time

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:36,330
zones and and in a project that brings

00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,090
so much passion from everybody and also

00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:44,160
we are all a little hard-headed

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:46,920
so discussions could become hard to deal

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,540
with but we have this code of conduct

00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:54,930
which puts the basic rules the basic

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,740
guidelines of what to do what not to do

00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:00,960
and you can sign it sank signing the

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,980
code of conduct is like a statement

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,490
saying yet it will be nice I will try my

00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:11,970
best when there are disagreements we

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:16,230
will try to solve them together make a

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:19,500
nice community so I invite everybody

00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:22,290
who's listening to search for the room

00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:27,150
to code of conduct and sign it if you

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:31,710
have questions again the community that

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:36,330
Ubuntu calm is a nice place where you

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:44,630
can ask your questions we have talked a

00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:47,510
lot a wide rp2 about the release party

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,150
chris mentioned that

00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:52,160
one of the reasons for work is local

00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,950
meeting was to organize something for

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,940
April correct so have you talked about

00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:01,700
ideas or do you have something in mind

00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,770
well it was just to share and to to hear

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,990
what what other locals would would do

00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,880
for their release party uh well if you

00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,280
don't attend a book on of course because

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,630
if I if I had the choice and I could

00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,260
teleport there I think I would do that

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:19,070
instead but um yeah so so the the basic

00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:23,510
ideas or or that we have so far or so

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:27,890
sharing the the social social activities

00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:30,890
like sharing beers food together this

00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:33,470
kind of things is a given then we were

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,310
also thinking about doing so a key

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,840
signing party because that's part of its

00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,070
a bit nerdy and usually people who

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,220
attend these meetings are a bit nerdy

00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:45,020
like like myself and it's it also makes

00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,790
sure that the the web of trust for the

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,760
keys we used to sign packages is big

00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:53,210
enough so so that's that's something

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,920
that that was there talks eventually but

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,470
I don't think anybody really picked up

00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,020
the flags to talk about some specific

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,960
subjects I wanted to give the

00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,670
opportunity to her host to tell us about

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,580
what they do with Ubuntu and I think

00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,140
having a round of so what do you guys do

00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,200
with your going to or why did you choose

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,960
Ubuntu and and and things like this but

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,850
it's still I mean we unfortunately like

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,770
I said in introduction we didn't have

00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,680
this meeting today because for for

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,119
logistics it had to be canceled so so we

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,470
didn't have the discussion that's just

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,880
the ideas I was going to bring to the

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,859
table but thankfully my my friends and

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,470
the Antilochus team would have more and

00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:35,990
uh well I wanted to see what what what's

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,570
your all your locals around the world in

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,550
this chat in this video chat or on IRC

00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,650
what what you think makes a release

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,540
party fun or what what makes you want to

00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,950
attend one so that's that's kind of the

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,640
question I wanted to ask to the greater

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,640
community today

00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:57,790
so I don't know what would you guys do

00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:08,190
mr. Ricca I don't know for the release

00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:08,190
we was different not as geek as usual

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:22,000
yes what's the previous release we did

00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:26,140
barbecue at my house and that was it

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,360
combines geek apart because on the TV on

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:33,210
the living room there well there was

00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:37,890
lightning talks people a little longer

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:41,010
about their projects not all strictly

00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:44,550
inside the room to communicate but all

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:50,800
related to free software free Hardware

00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:54,370
open data open apps it was very nice

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,960
it sounds great for me for me the ideal

00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:01,600
place it's a bar that will give us a

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,100
section with the TV so we can do this

00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,410
part with beers and food available

00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:12,700
because organizing the barbecue is it's

00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:17,350
like fun but it's a little more work but

00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:19,120
we will have to see and we usually get

00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:22,000
somebody from the community to design a

00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:27,310
shirt for the event that's like an

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,570
alternate design is its idea of this

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:34,240
Ubuntu release and that's very nice like

00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,790
everybody enjoys the shirt and then on

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:43,990
all our future communal our future

00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:49,290
events we are all dressed someone to

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:56,640
like this one this one was on Erik

00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:56,640
which was what a lot of years ago

00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,710
it's like a calendar with all the

00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:13,180
animals the previous animal is super

00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:17,560
cool too it's very nice yeah maybe we

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:21,340
can do this globally like publish the

00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,670
designs from everybody and all the teams

00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:32,110
can choose what they want to print and

00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:37,600
do the shirts on their own it's he has

00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:41,770
time to make a beeper or sounds really

00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:44,530
fun would some some video conferencing

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,060
of the different locos work well I guess

00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,570
if we're all in different bars it might

00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,130
be a little too noisy but but um if

00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:53,320
because I guess this time zone works for

00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,860
it well except maybe a pack but I guess

00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:09,070
it works for most of America is in

00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:11,710
Europe and Africa Google Hangouts God

00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:14,950
meets in a bar because we are all from

00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:18,580
different cities but all around Italy so

00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:21,130
usually on on these events on the

00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,320
release parties we we do Google Hangouts

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:29,410
but what you guys do sounds very

00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:30,910
interesting maybe maybe you say you have

00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,730
great fun it's it's I think it's

00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,440
something you should try to do better we

00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,140
are bit scattered all around the place

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,290
that's a problem it might be an answer

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,140
for for the the parts of our community

00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:47,080
that don't necessarily can like can't or

00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,030
don't want to make the travel to like a

00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,520
central location agreed Switzerland is

00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:54,130
not very big but still I I can see that

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,530
maybe it would be better that we offer

00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,300
the the alternative to join by hang out

00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:07,510
as well let's do it something I hadn't

00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:09,010
thought of thanks I would ask you Marcos

00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,340
as well but I already know what you're

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,340
gonna do

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,230
yes sorry they won't come we'll be in

00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:23,130
that days because of the release of the

00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:28,590
of the version I will wait everything

00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:32,640
every one of you in my city can you can

00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:37,520
you put a camera in a Google hangout on

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,520
that part for the people who can

00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:44,550
probably pictures but under stream I

00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,900
think will be complicated I think we

00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:51,300
will try a stream of the conference but

00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:55,350
it's a bit complicated I don't know me

00:48:51,300 --> 00:49:00,600
if we can do that we we usually do it

00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:04,880
low maintenance low budget so somebody

00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:07,880
with the phone it's just like trimmings

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,400
in other words and like yeah like

00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:15,840
precess it's complicated because of the

00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:19,170
noise but we will figure it out we can

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:24,420
see how it goes is there Wi-Fi in the

00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:29,040
place Markos is there no Wi-Fi in yet

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:32,100
him will be one Wi-Fi for the conference

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,600
and prefer the speakers and then we want

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:43,020
to one more Wi-Fi for the for the people

00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:49,410
in your aura to the Wi-Fi with my knife

00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:53,270
you can hang out in this picture will be

00:49:49,410 --> 00:50:05,760
Wi-Fi I think we Wi-Fi everyone hang out

00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:09,360
yes I I will drink I you will all right

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:13,980
so why don't we start a post on the on

00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,530
the community hub Chris now that you

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:20,010
brought this topic why don't you start

00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:22,050
the post on the community show about the

00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,050
release parties and we continue talking

00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,800
there also invite the other locals that

00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:29,430
are not

00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:34,080
here yep that's a guy all do it

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:38,370
that's a good idea Thanks

00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:40,980
and we are close to the hour so any of

00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:51,930
you have last topic you would like to

00:50:40,980 --> 00:51:00,300
discuss hey there's a remaining question

00:50:51,930 --> 00:51:04,200
on IRC do s mass do s manic asks why

00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:07,590
snaps and well I bring that to the table

00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,430
a lot because I enjoy snaps a lot I'm

00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:13,820
working on it

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:16,260
and I believe that they are very nice

00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:20,190
but he's asking why not

00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,640
apt babies but if sharing libraries is

00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,150
bad

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,250
well that's not the idea apt and that

00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:30,150
packages are great for a lot of things

00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:32,010
they are building the base of our

00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:36,180
operating system and that's not going to

00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:39,570
change like the images that Chris works

00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:44,100
on the cloud images that things that you

00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:46,830
can install on Lexi containers or Amazon

00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,350
or Google Cloud everywhere they are

00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:53,340
based on depth they are very well tested

00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:55,350
because we are taking advantage of all

00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,290
the work that Debian is doing preparing

00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:01,680
these releases we're going to syncs with

00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:03,960
Debian every six months and we try to

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:09,480
stabilize things and that that becomes

00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:12,420
unwieldy so apt and apps are great for a

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:17,010
few things for a lot of things snaps are

00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:19,980
great for some other things for example

00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:24,690
recently had their releases for Spotify

00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:28,320
and slack as snaps they are very popular

00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:34,280
applications that a lot of people in the

00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:37,560
window community want to use and it's

00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,510
risky to install them from a PPA because

00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,720
when you start something from a PPA you

00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,680
are

00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:46,349
giving your root password to the

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,260
developer so it's a lot of

00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:50,940
responsibility that you are giving to

00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,560
the you to that developer maybe the

00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,920
developer doesn't want that

00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:59,520
responsibility either and it's

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,200
complicated to make releases Halloween

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,220
de I want to really cycle it's

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:09,470
complicated to maintain APA snaps

00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:13,109
simplify a lot of these processes so

00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:16,440
take a look take a look at the new snaps

00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:19,470
in the Buddhist or I think you will like

00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:23,070
them and if there's a young project that

00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:25,200
wants to get into the Ubuntu store into

00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:27,240
the snap store because it's not only one

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,830
- it will be installed in many Linux

00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:36,830
distros you can join the community in we

00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:47,190
will evict we will keep you a habit to

00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:49,589
get your opponent thing just popped in

00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,320
my mind now if you want her I was

00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:56,550
thinking because Marcus was up was

00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:58,980
asking me if I could have a talk at to

00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,300
do book on as I was going now I said

00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,420
that I don't know where to talk about

00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,540
because I've been away out of a buncha

00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:09,420
for quite a time do you think you know

00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,130
it would be an idea to talk about these

00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,890
these are the create tracker

00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:17,810
these are ISO testing and the package

00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:20,640
packages testing or is it out of date

00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:23,300
maybe I could talk about testing on the

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,060
eyes of tracker or how to do some tests

00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,300
if you think that we're doing otherwise

00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:30,839
because something else I think that

00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,970
would be great

00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:38,790
and I think you should do it but I was

00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:40,589
also going to suggest you to show making

00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:44,160
your first you have been there you you

00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:46,910
were one of their personal subjects for

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:51,089
the documentation so I don't you to vote

00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:53,130
yes it could be an idea okay I just have

00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:56,700
to put something down

00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:58,019
okay could be an idea for the party you

00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,279
will be very busy

00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:14,430
oh yeah looks like Marcus said it was a

00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:16,859
party but for you it sounds like I think

00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:20,490
a lot of people is asking what can I

00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:23,819
talk about in the in the UN cone I think

00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:29,190
everyone owes a lot of things more than

00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:32,160
they think then for example about to

00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:33,869
your local team about your as you Serdar

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,059
experience how you sir it could be

00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:41,130
ripped because it's for sure and

00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:47,789
knowledge only whatever whatever could

00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:52,339
be great okay I'll let you know I know I

00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:52,339
was not talking about you I was talking

00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:03,059
thanks a lot

00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:06,029
Marcus things looked crease then slit

00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:09,750
Carla I hope to see you again

00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:11,190
in a month when we have power or earlier

00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:15,599
we can do this more often

00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:21,289
somebody has an alternate date so say

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:21,289
