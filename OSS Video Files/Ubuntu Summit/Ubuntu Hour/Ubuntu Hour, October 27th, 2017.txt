Description: 
	Informal meeting with people from the Ubuntu community from all around the world.

Bring your ideas, questions, problems. If you want to get started contributing with Ubuntu, this is the right place.

A few LoCo teams will host the event in a real-life location. If there's one nearby, join them! If there isn't, why don't you start hosting one? :D
