	00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:16,920
now hello everybody Carla okay hello I'm

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:19,350
still up for joining this is crazy idea

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,189
that we are it's called into our which

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,140
is not something new it's something we

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,519
used to do for years and years but it's

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,850
now not so very popular so to try to

00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,380
make it a little funnier again we have

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,890
this idea of connecting the different

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,200
locations around the world that

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,260
celebrate two in two hours

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,059
for this one it was very quick not a

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,510
long time so you will see a lot of

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,829
people in their houses hopefully the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,680
idea works then you will see them

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:59,010
different places a face or bars or

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,710
whatever they can find so more people

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,229
can come the idea is that people with

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,950
questions about want to have a place

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,420
that's constantly available for

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,950
everybody and they can bring their

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,310
doubts or if they want to start

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,360
contributing they will get friendly hand

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,650
and if there are problems we are all

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,670

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,240

for curiosity so I'm very glad to be

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:49,169
here and I'm trying to learn a lot

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:55,770
welcome that makes to Costa Ricans we

00:04:49,169 --> 00:05:04,050
are winning who would have expected you

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:06,500
sure Tim but it doesn't count you're

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,389
very far

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,199
yeah the u.s. is way too large for us

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:18,659
all to be in the same area unless it's

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,650
bland all right never mind now I will

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:26,969
try to get more Costa Ricans next time

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:29,400
and because I I organized this thing I

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:35,089
actually had time to find a place here

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,089
to meet so let me show you where I am

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:59,089
this is makerspace there's a laser

00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:01,939
cutter there are some 3d printers I see

00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:13,139
something to eat bread or something

00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:17,539
those are the come here experiment and

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:20,520
the idea is probably to eat here every

00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:24,629
every Friday or every other Friday in

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,469

Jenny Nicole thank you thanks for coming

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:12,210
and we have crease three button hello

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:15,830
I'm Chris class I'm from Geneva

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,300
Switzerland well originally and I've I

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:22,380
worked for canonical in the foundations

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,750
team so that's the team that generally

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,070
takes care of most of the plumbing in

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,680
the distribution so that is for example

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,960
the bootloader

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,930
compiler tool chains things like this

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,300
and importantly as well the cloud images

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:41,300
build system so I'm more on the cloud

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:43,410
images build system myself um I guess

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,260
something that's that people don't

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,180
usually expect from me is that I really

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,020
like to travel and so my wife and I had

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,510
the chance to

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,900
to live in Africa for a bit in Tanzania

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:58,650
precisely and I've been using Ubuntu for

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:01,080
a long time since breezy I think so I

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,610
try to use that for well everything

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,000
that's not a router is usually what I

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,710
say so yeah that's that's me

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,410
it's a I'm from my friend's house today

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:18,000
because yeah it's a it's it's a late

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:20,220
Friday night so that's it thank you and

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,610
yeah the hour is crazy for a lot of you

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:27,210
like the solids was we in a dark place

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,000
so thanks a lot for coming despite that

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,820
we'll talk later on the call about how

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,700
to make that easier for everybody but

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:43,160
we'll get there

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:47,280
you know how are you hello everybody

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,650
hello my name is Leo human is that

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,160
another day over from Costa Rica like

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:56,570
working in your city of Costa Rica and

00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,750
nice to meet you nice time with you

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:03,780
welcome so Leo now is my twin without

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,330
hair in his head which is very very

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:10,290
useful so when I can't make it there

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,350
we'll go there and talk about they all

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,780
can make it I will take care and it

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:20,480
seems like we're duped twice as much of

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,480
the work so thanks for coming

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,470
see this is a lot more people than what

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,740
I expected

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,400
which is very cool thanks for coming but

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,950
it's also going to be hard to keep this

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,089
organized so feel free to disorganized

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,880
it's in the stock whenever you want

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,890
I made a few bullet points of things

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,330
that were interesting to me on this

00:10:52,890 --> 00:11:02,100
first meeting they are on the on the

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:04,080
community website but if you want to

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,070
talk about something else or if one of

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,540
my points is foreign to you we will skip

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,710
it

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:17,040
but to start talking I wanted to mention

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:20,730
about the local community local council

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,450
elections that will happen very soon

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,880
hopefully today or maybe Monday the

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,440
thing is that the period of the local

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,660
council has expired they they work for

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,170
two years and then they get the chance

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,250
to be reelected or new people enjoying

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,100
the council and what this does is just

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:48,300
try to organize and help the local

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:51,260
communities around for those who don't

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,930
know local means local communities and

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,660
there used to be very strong strong just

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,350
as this Ubuntu hour was very popular a

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:05,220
few years ago but now the interest has

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,140
faded and we need to get that going

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,110
again because that's the way we reach

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:14,880
every corner of the world there was a

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:17,790
local team other an hour drive from most

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,279
people around the world so we want to

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,680
want to be very accessible very

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:27,380
inclusive to talk all the possible

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:30,690
languages and we can't do it from our

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:36,360
from our desktop we need to make a

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,790
network of people to join and a lot of

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,839
people here on this call are actually

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:49,300
candidates for that election

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:55,480
Karla King Kyle and Chris rent the

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:57,850
purview of our candidates yep yes

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,019
so thanks thanks a lot for stepping up

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,360
it was a little hard because on the

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,939
first call for elections we were making

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,970
a transition on the website where we

00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:13,449
make the communication so there was only

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,699
one candidate but now because you people

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:20,499
stepped up we can actually make the

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:23,829
election and we are very sure that

00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:27,129
whoever wins will make a very good job

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:29,259
on the following two years and if I

00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:32,230
think there are more candidates than

00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,139
seats this time so also if somebody

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:39,189
can't make it on the on the console I'm

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:42,879
sure you will help anyway from your

00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:46,449
space so I was wondering about your

00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:50,250
locals do you have noticed our local

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:50,250
teams working on your area or where

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,870
after coming back from from abroad I am

00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,199
I came back to Switzerland to a very

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,040
dead local that I feel I left a few

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,889
years prior a little more vibrant so

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,529
right now I'm in the phase where I'm

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,540
networking with old old people that I

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,930
used to know from back then and also

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,029
trying to attend more events and in

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,939
maybe not go to specific events but just

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:25,720
general Linux and or technology events

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:28,389
so yeah that's as far as I'm concerned

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,519
at least it's a it's it's a bit the

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:33,910
state of affairs so we've yet to

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,429
formally agree on a date to to meet and

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,819
as you as you know Switzerland has

00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,730
several different we have four national

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,230
languages actually so that's always been

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,579
a little bit tricky to organise as well

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,439
because some people will result having

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,269
to speak English to one another but then

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,250
some people will speak one language and

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:55,240
not the other and so the overlap is not

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,089
always easy to UM yeah I hope well

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,679
I'll find a way I mean we run a country

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:05,709
together so hopefully look I'll be able

00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:07,779
to run look overwrites and so we have a

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,189
logo here in North Carolina and it's

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:11,470
really not very active and hasn't been

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,449
in a very long time you know the states

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,179
pretty large and everybody's spread out

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:18,670
so I've made an attempt over the last

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,069
eight years to organize two different

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,319
events and I've gotten not a single

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:24,550
response which is very disappointing

00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,910
we've got to find a way to get and grow

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,790
these locals and get them moving again

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:37,329
and you say North Carolina is large

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:38,980
yeah I'm in Washington and and we have

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:43,119
sort of the same issue there is there's

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,449
a logo that is they will attend like you

00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:47,980
know Linux best Northwest or or seagull

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:51,689
or GGO I don't actually know how you

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,639
pronounce that the event name but that's

00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:57,129
five hours for me I'm down in the

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,420
southeast corner of it and then there's

00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:59,889
there's another one that seems to be

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,860
doing some things out of Portland but

00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:05,290
that's like five hours another direction

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,600
and so whenever I'm doing anything I'm

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,029
always sending emails to the Idaho

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,339
Washington and Oregon locos just to try

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:17,499
to get everyone who is within driving

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:20,769
distance and typically any event I do

00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:21,759
around here is met with crickets but at

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,740
least I have a couple of universities

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,860
that they do see they have some interest

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,860
in this Bay

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,559
let's go okay

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:44,920
in a span race and one to Spain in there

00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:48,730
is one two in Catalan and there is an i

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,309
thing is important and the key users

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,470
there are a few users who are doing a

00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:56,410
lot of stuff and they are very

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,110
compromised for example having torero

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,709
from another narrow pak'ma'ra narrow and

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,669
and we are trying to get the users for

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:08,740
another online activities for example a

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:13,329
podcast um

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:16,510
and I was in now on counts of Paris I'm

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:21,000
grace incredible to see hundreds of

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:24,819
people around the Obon Kong is I think

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,399
in a few countries the people like more

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:32,370
the face to face in other in another

00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:35,500
countries they like their online event

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,970
it's complicated I think in each country

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:48,370
the people the users like one thing or

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:50,620
another or maybe no one of them well I

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:55,390
can jump in now I haven't got my my

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,380
video sorry my camera stopped working in

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:02,140
Italy we have a local one of one local

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,919
team man we all scattered around Italy

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:10,120
and we usually meet two times a year we

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,210
decide a place a hotel and we meet where

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,390
and we miss a a day together and we we

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,240
have chats and we have presentations and

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,330
there are a few people that are active

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,899
that go around talking about a rule too

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,480
but this it's the few st. people I think

00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:30,360
what we can do any 2d structure to keep

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,200
in touch more

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:40,390
maybe with trying to have some video

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,100
conferences or maybe try to I would like

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,429
to find a way to get in some young

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,279
people youngster we are missing of young

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,200
young people that that would that would

00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,860
be a nice thing to try and get young

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:59,080
people in individual community so that

00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:04,929
maybe will be my goal young people like

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:07,179
what age are we talking here with yes

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:08,740
universities more or less yes even

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,580
younger if they want our I don't one

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,770
complaint there's no physical no yeah I

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,110
think university would be nicer or even

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,299
if you started for this is my son's only

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,950
12 and he's good even contain stories of

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,950
attorneys and he's quite active

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,750
so it depends on the person as long as

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,690
as young people would come in I think it

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,320
would be a nice thing because they they

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,630
thrive more they more active I think

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,620
then it's not like old people I mean I'm

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,110
on Aldi but it's just an idea

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,610
yeah well so something one of the ways I

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,310
was able to start getting involved with

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,340
the local university was I I emailed

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,380
their CS Department and said hey how

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,020
would you guys feel about having a

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:58,430
release party this was you know like but

00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:01,400
a couple weeks ago now or no oh yeah

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:05,930
when we released 1710 and they were

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,400
super receptive to it yeah you can't

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:11,590
really see with the context in the

00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,590
university but we'll try to make them

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,640
sorry yeah

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,070
soon Roxy Roxy very new to the community

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,560
right have you been to a local meeting

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:35,180
before yeah I was gonna say I just

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,640
looked it up and they're into Texas loco

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,940
that's based in the Dallas area which is

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:46,340
close to me so it doesn't seem like it's

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:51,980
been active since about 2010 so I mean I

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:55,340
I did make a note to local that I don't

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,550
know there's one still going on under no

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:06,890
one yeah I just join the mailing list

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:09,020
and she had an email who wants to tell

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,010
the Costa Rican experience it will be

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:16,910
cheating if I if I tell it because I'm

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:22,420
always organizing the party now you're

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:27,020
you're almost always there almost always

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:29,230
party since the beginning the party

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,230
right

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:38,450
that's the only thing we do its I didn't

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:46,440
see you are you there

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:53,250
why am I here yes I love the subway

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:55,400
leave it so the open source so I went

00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:02,550
working with open source or free

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:09,200
software and about I don't know ten

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:15,780
years murder standard Ubuntu from is a

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:20,310
very good system for and for people not

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:28,590
finished not innocent people so I love

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:31,200
to work with system yeah and and well

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,230
since 10 years ago we started the local

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,370
actually didn't somebody did and then he

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:41,040
abandoned it and there was nothing left

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,560
to do than to take it so we started

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,750
making parties every six months and

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,240
that's that's what our locker that's

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,460
that's it is every six months get

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,300
together and make party make some

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,870
presentations and it's good that works

00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:02,370
for us we had the release party like

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:06,360
last week there was Alan there are you

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:11,310
you didn't assist this time disappointed

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:18,060
and we did some karaoke that was our way

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:20,490
to enjoy that's all really fun I think

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,310
that's probably a good format for at

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,700
least as far as I'm concerned were for

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,100
alone products

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,110
it's bad but that's that's been sleeping

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,460
for a while having a release party every

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,650
six months sounds like a reasonable

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:40,060
first start and perhaps as well getting

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:41,620
getting more involved than in other like

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,210
technical events I'm thinking for

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,420
example of django girls who is doing a

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,390
great job at having regular meetings and

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,270
and and generally having an outreach

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,130
program to universities and so to people

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,540
who are new to programming well girls

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,580
was the primary objective in the

00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,770
beginning but now it's expanded to two

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:05,560
teaching while Django in particular who

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:09,280
are new to programming and I guess I

00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,790
guess getting in touch with these with

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,320
these circles and communities can also

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:17,260
simply in the meantime between release

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,030
parties is a good way to to to meet

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,880
people and network and find people who

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:25,360
might be interested to come party every

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,650
six months with us as well hopefully we

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:35,970
get to make it more often this is the

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,970
first one to our in Costa Rica solace

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:45,040
yes I would like to share my experience

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,250
about one thing it was the best thing I

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,400
did with the bun - it was a very little

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,070
thing but it was really really

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:59,350
interesting here the people speaks in

00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:03,700
Australian language and one in one bar

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:07,960
the there is a public computer for the

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:13,030
people then one - is the first operating

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:17,790
system in Austria and the PA we started

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:22,210
Ubuntu in that public PC and the people

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:25,890
taking a drink in the bar they they were

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:29,620
using that PC is in Australia then

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:34,260
everyone like like a - one - it was

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:37,040
really and we put LEDs here - the PC

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,250
series for the locals and then we

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,670
for everyone and it was I think the best

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:47,630
experience for from my site because

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:50,030
every a you you share you wanted to a

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,030
lot of people and I think thousands of

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:57,760
people in the year and it was really one

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,760
Easter I was really interested in that

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:07,730
thanks everybody for your experiences

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,430
and it sounds like we are all almost on

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:14,420
the same place so that's the idea of

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:18,200
these meetings that we if we make a call

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:20,510
for a meeting now a real meeting it will

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,590
be a couple of us or maybe three people

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:26,240
so let's break the borders we are

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,200
working on the same thing and we can

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,710
actually make that distributed into our

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,400
and figure things out

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:40,190
maybe we can support on different ways

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,320
to make the open two hours from each

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,850
location a little better or more tract

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:50,330
or maybe we are okay just being from our

00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,970
house joining the urban to our so we

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:56,240
will have to see where this lead us and

00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:00,310
and I think that was the next suggested

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:07,280
topic like I don't have a clear idea of

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:11,210
what to do can left like thanks he had

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:15,070
to go to something I don't have a clear

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,840
idea of what to do with this space and

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,660
only thing I have clear is that we need

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,140
to talk a little more and that we need

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,500
to figure it out together and there are

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,230
already a few limitations like this call

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,410
has a limit of ten people and some

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:37,970
people were left out of the of the video

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:41,440
chat so we need to maybe split it maybe

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,530
the one in European time maybe the one

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,960
in the Americas time and hopefully we

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,960
will get an Asia version of this

00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:57,440
for now it seems like we are we are a

00:27:53,119 --> 00:28:00,549
small group so trying to find on our

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,399
that's not terrible for for all of us

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:11,269
absolutely work and we have a new member

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:14,509
know that they left how are you teaching

00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:19,389
how your your nickname I can never

00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:32,329
pronounce it like I'm sure he hear us

00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:44,569
and he's hello hey guys no all right so

00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:50,179
someone it's it's the first time we

00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:52,969
actually talk in a real chance he is

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:57,709
also a member of the newly appointed

00:28:52,969 --> 00:29:02,239
Community Council and he will be talking

00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:05,989
lists a lot years we were talking about

00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:08,599
our our experiences on our locus and I

00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:11,659
hear yours is a little stronger than the

00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:14,199
rest right do you have frequent

00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,199
activities

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,980
all right

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,870
what's happening but we can continue

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,100
talking about the root flower do you

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:41,260
have ideas we have proposals things you

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:53,580
are already adding from this first

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:56,050
session yes it is this something that so

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,880
sorry I wasn't completely clear before I

00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:02,230
joined the call but it sounds like this

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:11,860
is something you want to provide to the

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:13,870
public right like we go to and and where

00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:18,820
people might be interested in learning

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:24,910
more or what is the what is the main

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:27,730
objective that so that's that's that's

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:31,510
for us to decide and I think it depends

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:35,080
on every location in here I think we

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,990
need a place to meet frequently because

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,840
what happens is that people goes to our

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,260
office or they go to my house or we meet

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,090
at a cafe when they have questions and

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,429
we get a huge queue of people with

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,380
problems it would be a lot better if we

00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:55,059
can get them together and talking

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:58,059
between them and they usually ask when

00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:00,309
do you meet so I think in Costa Rica we

00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:04,540
will find a place either make it here

00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:07,980
every week or jump to a different places

00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:12,429
so it's close to where people are and

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:15,910
try to make some marketing and make it a

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:19,360
little more visible so we get people

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,550
coming but I'm not sure in your taste

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,030
and I'm not sure if that's what you want

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:28,870
I mean as I said if you want to stay and

00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:32,050
participate from your house you are very

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:34,480
welcome to do so if you would like to

00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:40,149
meet with some other people

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:44,619
in real life that's awesome too if I may

00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:47,830
I think the the overall goal of this in

00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:51,720
general is to try to get people more

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:54,700
involved right and and and to that end

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,159
even the simple fact of having a limit

00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,659
to ten people here is gonna get in the

00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,129
way right so we might want to consider

00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,289
some alternate technologies like blue

00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:04,539
jeans or something like that but but I

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,179
think if we if we continue to keep the

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:10,239
focus on getting people more involved or

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,859
making sure that we make time for your

00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,659
questions about anything really

00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:15,580
then that gets it gives people an

00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,080
opportunity to come and ask something

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,090
that they're not really comfortable

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,820
asking somewhere else right because open

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,200
sources distort be kind difficult to get

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:31,350
into sometimes they may want to make a

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:36,600
good - as firmly as possible hello Simon

00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,600
change do you want to introduce yourself

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:52,029
on that somebody leaves and somebody

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:56,529
else takes the place okay and one one

00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:58,600
point please I would like to - 1/2 a

00:32:56,529 --> 00:33:01,989
bunch hours maybe in the official

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,749
channel in here in another language for

00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:06,820
example I think they will motivate to

00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:09,129
the people because the English is

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:13,659
complicated for a lot of us for example

00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:15,609
for me then speaking Spanish when

00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:18,669
another language I think will be

00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:23,710
brilliant and motivate to more people to

00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:26,499
stay here just an idea that's that's a

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,080
very good point and those are the

00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:32,249
possible splits we can make to make this

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,759
sustainable and actually productive

00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:38,440
split by language or split by region I

00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,259
see there's a lot of people here talk in

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:47,220
Spanish so maybe next time we do one

00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:47,220
Spanish English that could work

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,790
also have you considered doing special

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:01,150
editions for certain conferences or

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:05,160
certain events where someone would go

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:08,860
there and you know stream from there

00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:13,060
sorry my connection wrote just when you

00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:15,100
use everything

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,100
have you considered doing a special

00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,020
edition type thing where somebody would

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,139
go to a conference and scream from there

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:28,300
so that more people would have access to

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:32,429
this at the same time hey that's a very

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:37,780
good idea I wasn't thinking about it but

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:42,070
we can it's somebody view conference

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,919
soon we can experiment it's very good

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:48,730
and well the original idea of good to

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:52,120
our was that everybody does it whenever

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:54,340
they feel like doing it I was thinking

00:34:52,120 --> 00:35:03,640
that this first call was going to be

00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:06,610
with three people not 15 viewers so it

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,060
since we already have enough people

00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:16,030
interested to make it at a different

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:24,810
time a different date so anybody going

00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:28,750
to a conference soon wants to make this

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:34,210
I'm going to one on November 4th but

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:40,450
that's a Saturday so I don't know that's

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:43,630
that's besides the FW you know it was it

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:46,750
was interesting in the last you Hong

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:53,560
Kong Europe we were talking about the

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:56,680
next Hong Kong Alan Martin and although

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,020
people said in Germany there is a very

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,410
strong community in France

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,900
there is a very big strong community but

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:10,080
in the rest of countries there is not

00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:14,710
big community for doing some big event

00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:18,460
but I think there is a lot of key users

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:22,330
who can do that is not necessary to have

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:26,160
a big community behind and for example

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:31,050
three compromised users could do

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,050
something like I won't come for example

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:43,570
for conference we have so many teachers

00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:47,380
tournament and I don't expect that we

00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:53,380
will make a very good plan here today

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:55,390
this is just to talk and throw ideas we

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,120
have the election of the local council

00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,400
so they will help us organising the

00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:04,360
ideas and maybe organizing people and

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,980
maybe maybe making some more visible

00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:11,560
plans that will happen in two weeks and

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:15,730
in the meantime we can actually jump to

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,800
the next point on my list of topics talk

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:21,010
on the community hope the community hub

00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,100
is a new place for the community so

00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,260
before the window community used to talk

00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:29,050
on the forum some people on the mailing

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,380
list some other people on the IRC

00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,870
channels some other people and there was

00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:38,040
the wicked of mention a few things and

00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:41,500
then the wiki got a lot of spam and

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,070
everything was in a little chaotic State

00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,860
a few months ago but now we have this

00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:52,240
website to organize everything or at

00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,910
least make it a place where all the

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,320
links to other places are up-to-date and

00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:01,290
it's called the community hub that's

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,410
community.com

00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:08,470
so if you haven't joined I would

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:12,130
appreciate a lot if you do because the

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,640
only way that the site will alive is if

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,360
we

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,890
fit it with a lot of contents so there

00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,750
is one category in there for that

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,900
Community Council maybe we can make

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,790
analytic at Seabury or locals or for

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,850
local communities or presidents or

00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:32,530
foreign languages or whatever and throw

00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:34,960
all our ideas in there well while we

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:38,340
find the right place just make a topic

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,560
anywhere we will move it later or maybe

00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,370
in that place all your ideas everything

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,590
that you suggested here please take the

00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,570
time to go into the communities you just

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:56,940
in there we will continue discussing so

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:56,940
we have have you been using the hub

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,360
Congress program for that their website

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:18,430
is really really modern and I think

00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:20,110
useful I've had a quickly I just joined

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:26,260
it yesterday I think or the day before

00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:28,770
so it's similar to the other forms oh I

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,770
got confused

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:42,970
why won't it let me login Oh what the

00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:51,660
the bright orange banner didn't didn't

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:51,660
clue you in you thought maybe it changed

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:05,770
hope to see you hi Marco I think the new

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,010
site definitely has promised we just

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:15,250
need to make sure we you know give it

00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:18,670
life yeah and well there are bugs of

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:21,880
course the site has been open for two

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,800
weeks I think so there are many things

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,820
that we haven't experiment that I had a

00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,400
problem with images

00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:36,760
well I had no idea that it wouldn't let

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,530
people post the first time we are all

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,950
learning there's also a category for

00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:44,010
force IP feedback so this is our site is

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:47,470
the site of the community feel free to

00:40:44,010 --> 00:41:02,099
to propose changes and even better to

00:40:47,470 --> 00:41:02,099
work on those channels good our ego

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,300
booster so yeah

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:12,940
hey so I'm Simon

00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,190
I'm the lewbert's release manager and

00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,630
just in general an abuti developer I've

00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,180
been around the community for a couple

00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,830
years but yeah I just thought this was

00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:31,480
an interesting thing so wanna come say

00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:34,240
hi cool it's crazy King yes No so I was

00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,470
thinking about these people coming and

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,839
living maybe that's a way to scale like

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,700
take turns

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:50,950
nobody stays here for more than 30

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:52,330
minutes somebody else wants to work now

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:58,810
that sounds good

00:41:52,330 --> 00:42:07,810
good idea that your way of asking me to

00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:09,910
leave but yeah in general if I could add

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,880
my two cents on the community hub I

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,320
really think it's a it's a good spot for

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,510
you know people to collaborate on foodon

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,580
too because so far I've seen a lot of

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,580
usage of it where you know it hasn't

00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:23,560
been has been used before like for

00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,020
example like the move the google code-in

00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,670
thing we were accepted as a as an

00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,320
organization and that really helped with

00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,260
coordination of that and a couple other

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,760
different things which you know wouldn't

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,850
have been done without the community hub

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,040
so I'm really really happy it was

00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:41,410
implemented and put in place because now

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,210
we'll have a central location of sorts

00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:50,740
to be able to collaborate on that sort

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:54,010
of thing so I'm excited for it let's try

00:42:50,740 --> 00:43:01,060
to keep it the life I survived two weeks

00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:03,280
which is a good sign I have some other

00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:07,990
topics but I wouldn't like to just talk

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:12,270
about what so he's somebody else is

00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,270
there something to talk about

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm gonna talk about hack Cobra fest

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:28,500
though I like your I liked your proposed

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:30,850
layout there put them here you start I

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,520
said I said I liked your proposed

00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,350
schedule the next item was was talking

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,570
about Oktoberfest who who has

00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,800
participated and there are a couple days

00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:44,890
left if you have no idea what I'm

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:48,780
talking about yeah I have - who doesn't

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:54,700
have a shirt and wants to make requests

00:43:48,780 --> 00:44:00,160
does anyone not know what this is why

00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:02,860
don't you just wait anyway for all the

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,990
people will be seeing this so there's a

00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,520
there's a post on on

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,230
the community of that we were just

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,500
talking about community over to calm

00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:13,210
about this but but Oktoberfest is a

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,390
collaboration between digitalocean

00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,580
and github to reward open source

00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,990
contributions basically in the month of

00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,530
October

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:28,540
make four pull requests on gab and get a

00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:31,300
t-shirt and so the what projects

00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:34,290
participating in this do is they tag

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,790
specific issues that they think are are

00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:39,430
relatively bite-sized right or good

00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,260
newcomer issues with Oktoberfest or in

00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:45,160
our case if we with snap craft we just

00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:47,020
use the bite size tag but it doesn't

00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,180
that's just to help you find an issue

00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,850
all the all they do have counts is that

00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:56,170
you made a poor quest in general so

00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:58,690
check it out it's pretty cool I just I

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,540
just put I just did a check for myself

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:14,070
and I got thirty one poor request set of

00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:14,070
four so about you their request for our

00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:27,430
it's like pretty shirt but it's it's

00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,800
also so much as it to because Kyle

00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:33,430
and I were were participating as mentors

00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,119
for anybody who would like to join our

00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:39,609
project shirt and we still have a few

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,970
days and in this two days are not work

00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:44,590
for food requests so an hour still by

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,950
saying she's up there or issues they

00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,960
attack confessed so go check it out yeah

00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:52,510
and actually everything works like we

00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:57,900
have a lot of typos I always help is

00:45:52,510 --> 00:46:04,030
because it's if our team is health and

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:07,630
we just can't type a few of of English

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:11,050
works like successfully is spelled in

00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:13,840
all the possible different ways that we

00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:18,720
can do it it was not trusted code base

00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:21,609
so therefore share five for me

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:26,099
successful so to get started you don't

00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:30,160
have to know a lot it is often too

00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:32,319
beginner to learn and we can start eager

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:36,099
to learn we can start learning slowly

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:40,420
and start building the abilities

00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:45,510
together it's very useful Roxy was one

00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,510
of our contributors and we learned a lot

00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:54,790
I also noticed on the oktoberfest

00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:58,270
website that you'll get stickers whether

00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,380
or not you do for full repos ah I did

00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,530
not see that thank you for the

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,530
information

00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:13,150
cool so afterwards best is about to end

00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:17,190
but this is what we do all year long

00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:20,619
this is what everybody in the community

00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:23,470
does we need a lot of tents and we get

00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:26,369
when we get new contributors we are very

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:35,740
very happy

00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:37,210
so maybe priests no I want to I want to

00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,960
hear how many get help or requests you

00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:46,450
made in October me oh we still have a

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:51,000
lot of good based on that that doesn't

00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:55,930
count as far as I know but uh sorry

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,230
doctor next to this but you get the

00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:04,750
knowledge in blind stickers but

00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:06,609
apparently I was I was gonna suggest in

00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,440
the same direction something that I I

00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:11,470
realized was going on and I realized

00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,359
because I I tried myself was some some

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,460
testing it for it as well from the from

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,790
the Community Council I think

00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,750
aisel testing so I think I wasn't aware

00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,730
I was going on

00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,829
before I actually had to try installing

00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,260
it on my own system because I want to

00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:29,140
kick the tires and one of my colleagues

00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,819
how did you report it and in the ISO

00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,240
testing tracker which is which is great

00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:33,740
so Q wait

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,740
who brings calm if I remember correctly

00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,630
on top of my head and that's that's I

00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,690
guess it goes a little bit us in

00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,670
direction a little more hands-on

00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,400
activities that locals can contribute to

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,859
in the same direction as observer fest

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,470
so of course I am testing is just one of

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:55,760
them but I guess a lot of contribution

00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:57,859
can be simply reporting issues that

00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,160
people find in a proper way that's all

00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:02,599
it's incredibly helpful so that might be

00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,480
something we could consider sending out

00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:08,030
the booty stickers for okay

00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,400
oh yeah boots Oktoberfests as well not

00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:14,089
not for requests but bug proper blog

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:20,589
opens well we have to find something we

00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:20,589
can find sponsors like this shirts

00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:30,650
January fests we need a better name make

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,170
it sound yeah preferably a bit further

00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,390
away from the from the party that's uh

00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:39,740
so there's more time to actually fix the

00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:44,569
bugs then best yeah right that's good an

00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:48,910
idea at least show it to that should and

00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:59,750
Simon your your project is also always

00:49:48,910 --> 00:50:01,880
hunts yeah absolutely so lots of

00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:06,740
different things dude there's packaging

00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:09,290
of fixing documentation we need a lot of

00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,640
designers we need a lot of people who

00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:18,280
are not programmers because they help a

00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:20,869
lot in a lot of surprising ways and

00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,329
that'sthat's the next proposed topic

00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:28,460
Kyle said he liked my trapeze because I

00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:32,900
will just go ahead and use the meeting

00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:37,460
for myself the next topic is the code in

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:41,510
that project supported by Google and

00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,360
it's for four students between 13 and 17

00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:47,350
years old

00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,540
so we have just been approved as an

00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:53,080
organization for the codeine which I

00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,200
think it's spherical I feel kind of

00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,270
proud because it's 25 organizations and

00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:03,240
I was looking at the stats and they have

00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:06,580
like 50,000 students over the years with

00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,400
insane amount of tasks so this is just

00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:14,050
starting we have been approved we half a

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:18,220
month to to suggest a lot of possible

00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:20,650
tasks for young people newcomers not

00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:24,460
necessarily simple tasks because they

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:29,050
know a lot we can we can even send them

00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:36,190
some of our heart box get some extra

00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:39,130
help we have until November to fill time

00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:42,700
to get Mentors

00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:45,070
and then the 28th of November students

00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:50,020
will start joining and will start being

00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:53,610
contacted by them so everybody here on

00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:56,470
this call is probably a good mentor I

00:51:53,610 --> 00:52:00,060
invite you to jump into the hop take a

00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:03,490
look at the topic and such as your test

00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:07,900
tests and if I could I could interject

00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:09,670
for a moment I actually two years ago we

00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,680
participated in google code-in as well

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:14,290
we didn't get the chance to last year

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,840
but I ended up being a mentor in the

00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:19,630
2015 go-round of it and I think it's a

00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,390
really nice opportunity to you know get

00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:24,700
people involved and open source we had a

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,680
lot of different tasks and it's it's I

00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,090
just I just want to say that I'm looking

00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,010
forward to doing it again but if you

00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,350
have any if anybody has any questions on

00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:34,390
how things go from a mentor point of

00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,430
view if you haven't done it before then

00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:38,890
you know feel free to feel free to let

00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:41,470
me know but it's I still have the the

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:44,110
the t-shirt they sent me from from two

00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:46,270
years ago somewhere around here but yeah

00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:50,470
it's it's if you're looking to get a

00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:53,770
t-shirt right let's get a teacher and

00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:57,220
help out a boot to but free software

00:52:53,770 --> 00:53:00,540
dress does meet I'm learning

00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:03,880
our hopeful to see me okay

00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,410
mmm yeah right now I'm actually but

00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,720
that's what isn't really good but I'm

00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:12,130
wearing a bright orange a blue tune a

00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:13,599
circle a friend shirt so yeah see we

00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:22,869
need to have we need to have a serious

00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:26,380
talk your open source pants yeah get my

00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:28,000
bed that's right my orange shirts bright

00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:32,859
orange socks with a circle of friends

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,640
would be actually pretty nice it's

00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:37,660
trending

00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:40,240
it's what the cool kids are doing and

00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,480
Simon your experience is great because

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,210
of what age did you join the community

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,160
um I joined when I was when I was 13 and

00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:50,050
Walter keep just he just joined he's

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,390
also someone who participated as a

00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:59,050
mentor so yeah it was I I joined when I

00:53:55,390 --> 00:54:00,070
was I think 13 but it was like I said

00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,690
before it's really a great opportunity

00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:06,570
to help people out

00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:11,710
so yeah you people young people they

00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:14,320
hello Walter I'm sorry the Hangout was

00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:22,000
full when you try it can you introduce

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:26,800
yourself Walter my Pinsky I've been

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:30,190
around can you can hear me okay good

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,530
yeah no I've been around here in the

00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:36,369
booth community wearing various and

00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:40,720
sundry hats for a while mostly my

00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:42,849
contributions have been to Lubuntu also

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,700
helped out community and I've been on

00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:47,500
the local council and I'm still on the

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,960
membership board I'm on the community

00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,960
council yeah so the wear couple hats

00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:56,220
instincts a lot for all your work

00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:02,380
as he said he's not part of the

00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:05,560
community council that will help us

00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:08,980
through the next two years

00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:16,900
it's an hour already so anybody wants to

00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:19,330
say some party words I would like to say

00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:23,369
that a boon to kilts would be really

00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:25,540
cool Agreda

00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:28,540
probably probably cheaper to make than

00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,130
pants do and easier to size yeah you

00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,770
think so I mean there's like less fabric

00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:36,150
so and you know like potentially like

00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:38,560
unisex and you know so more inclusive

00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,950
sock size and kilts is actually more

00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:47,890
tricky than I expected for how oh darn

00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:51,460
Wow that's unexpected hey I'm sorry I

00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:53,859
just wanted to ask where are the where

00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,609
should people go if they want to submit

00:55:53,859 --> 00:56:03,940
pull requests issues in github or on

00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:08,470
launch pad or where should they go it's

00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:10,330
a very hard question to answer and part

00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:13,839
of what we need to do better because

00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:17,109
that need is in the transition we were

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,510
in lunch but only like everything 1 2

00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:21,460
was in lunch but even the answers like

00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:24,520
the questions or the translations

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:27,700
everything was illegible then we started

00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,580
moving the questions to ask 1 2 that's

00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,109
Stack Overflow because it just makes

00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:36,640
sense like there's more people there

00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:38,770
it's more useable then the translations

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,730
started moving by themselves to

00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:43,300
transifex

00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:46,150
and then the projects start moving to

00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:52,060
get up and then the Box start moving to

00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:55,480
get up too and well now we are in a lot

00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:57,160
of different places which is a very good

00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:01,950
challenge for the following years

00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:04,930
because if if you see it from a

00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:07,300
sustainability point of view it's a lot

00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:11,230
better than every project is distributed

00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,450
in different places and it's better for

00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:18,130
them to choose that well that works for

00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,309
them without limitations for us that we

00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,930
are

00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:26,249
trying to make something consistent and

00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:26,249
easy and good for newcomers its submiss

00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:34,359
personally I think the solution is

00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:37,749
mentors like if you want to file your

00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:40,449
first bar you don't just go in there you

00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:44,319
go in there together with somebody will

00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:48,219
give you a hint through the process but

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:50,680
I don't know it's one of the really big

00:57:48,219 --> 00:58:07,209
challenges that we have for this next

00:57:50,680 --> 00:58:11,619
two years so are you talking about a

00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:12,939
specific person well what I mean is if

00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:15,189
somebody wants to get involved in

00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:20,199
oktoberfest and they they need to do the

00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:21,819
for all all the calculus counter tractor

00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,589
professors or for requests so the issue

00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:25,150
is don't really matter it depends on

00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:27,339
where the project you want to contribute

00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:29,259
to hosts their issues so like for snap

00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:31,179
crafts we host our issues in Launchpad

00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:33,249
and so we have two bite-sized over there

00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:35,349
but for other projects they may host

00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:37,029
their issues in India hub it it's just

00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,949
going to depend on the project but for

00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:43,390
hack cobra fest is all about the pull

00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:46,779
requests on github okay so yeah when I

00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:57,160
sew Launchpad is still the best place to

00:58:46,779 --> 00:59:00,130
find the first four staff draft yes yes

00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:03,160
I would I would recommend people to go

00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:06,099
to the hub community document to come

00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,989
there should be a post in there for

00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:12,369
everything you need to do if there is

00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:14,920
not we feel it and like they're supposed

00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:18,969
for hardcover fest in there you're

00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:23,410
supposed for code in there there are not

00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:25,420
many more so we need to this is a good

00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:28,709
experience like with you when you when

00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:31,449
you came first and wanted to contribute

00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:32,050
we didn't have a lot of the materials

00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:34,270
that we have

00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:37,390
now that's some things that you helped

00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:42,640
us helped us figure out and even

00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:49,600
document in try we need to get there in

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:52,690
a lot of projects okay so the best thing

00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,560
you do is go to the community community

00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:58,120
ubuntu.com and and look for the

00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,190
oktoberfest post and then if you have a

00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:05,250
question about a certain project where

01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:08,580
where to go they will that's in their

01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,580
work already

01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:19,510
that's that's the idea like it's not

01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:21,370
close to being perfect know we're at

01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:29,670
least subscribe to that buddy else will

01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:35,290
answer soon interrupted was to decrease

01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:37,750
examiner's trying to fit him I think

01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:40,230
basically what I wanted to say was what

01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,230
sort of covered

01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:56,240
okay I didn't hear that

01:00:52,340 --> 01:01:01,190
my connection is dying slowly so this is

01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:04,640
a good moment you say I guess since a

01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:08,270
lot really you have no idea how much I

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:11,120
appreciate this and we will keep talking

01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:14,770
on the community of how the idea would

01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:19,540
be to do this every other week or so so

01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:23,960
keep an eye in there or for the planning

01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:26,300
I also want to say thank you to Sylvia

01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,420
