and the idea is just to talk about

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:20,400
topics related to the Ubuntu community

and we will try to answer them if you

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,180

craft project and here with me as usual

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,840
we have an interesting mix of people we

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,230
have people from the community and we

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,409
have people work participating on Google

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,240
coding which is a project for teenagers

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,650
for students who want to get started

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,049
contributing to free software there are

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,740
more than 20 organizations who want to

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,470
participate in there it's being like

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,400
three weeks of the challenge and there

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,950
have already been like 200 tasks

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,850
completed so it has been amazing a lot

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,960
of a lot of interesting work coming so

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:40,049
why don't you introduce yourselves

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,710

Community Council I work with the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:02:00,030
flavors Lubuntu and Kubuntu which was a

00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:02,250
lot of fun and I'm also a mentor for the

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,960
google code-in so I've been kind of

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,850
helping out a little bit here in there

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,970

this is actually the third year I've

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,440
done it I've done it once before for the

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,840
two and another time for

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,150
which was actually a interesting thing

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:25,140
in and of itself and that's my story

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:44,430
interesting things to say I tried to man

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,730
recently trying to reactivate my local

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,630
community here in Portugal we had a long

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,720
down time period and we're trying to set

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:58,740
things back on track and since I'm also

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,950

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,530

codeine participant in less than two

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:34,230
weeks on and done some tasks related to

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:41,220
naps and snap crafts and I'm generally

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:41,760
interesting ICT and filming thanks for

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,310
coming

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:50,459
really the last one is dick hi I'm Jake

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,350
and I'm I'm dinging you go code in and I

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,750
just want to do it so I learn about um

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,239
open source projects and like how its

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:04,140
contributes them and stuff so I know I'm

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:08,459
a student in the UK this man has been

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:12,000
really interesting first thinking what

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,280
are good tasks for newcomers but making

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,190
sure that they are of all levels of

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,479
expertise because there are junk but

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,430
they know a lot so there are some tasks

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,090
that are really complicated and they are

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:31,169
finishing them nicely but there there's

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:35,820
a lot of time too the contest ends I

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:39,000
think it's mid January and holidays are

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:45,030
coming so if you are student you can go

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,169
to code what's the website called that

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:53,100
with yeah it's weird

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:55,500
coating dots with google.com and we will

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,470
be helping more people there's a lot of

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,100
time there are tasks for really new

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,750
people like how to art installing new

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,020
include and there our documentation

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,620
tasks that will help you understanding

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,860
how to get productive if you want to and

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,950
then there are coding tasks or other

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,010
kinds of things we can talk about that

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:23,490
later with these two guys that are

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:28,440
joining us today but we have sort of

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,930
agenda or less about whatever comes

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,770
so somebody throws a question we can

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,229
digress and start talking about that but

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,010
the proposed agenda is to first talk

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:45,510
about their code of conduct which is

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:48,180
what let us work together we are a very

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,979
diverse community people from all around

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:58,470
the world many languages many cultures

00:05:51,979 --> 00:06:00,479
many situations and contexts so as part

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,849
of the Ubuntu community we are great to

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,330
follow a code of conduct and be nice to

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:09,660
each other why don't you tell us a

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:13,260
little more about that Walter okay yeah

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,680
be happy to so first things first I'm

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:20,729
going to drop a link to the current code

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,530
of conduct in the IRC channel for

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,160
anybody that wants to kind of follow

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:30,720
along but yeah I mean it's it's really

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,389
important for us to be inclusive to

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,919
people of all different backgrounds and

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,039
you know make sure that all of those

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,490
different members and perspectives in

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:45,900
our community can actually work to get

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:51,949
to the common goal of keeping abouttwo

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:55,680
working well so if you look at the the

00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:58,080
code of conduct there is basically you

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,699
know two sections one kind of talks

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,490
about leadership and how I don't want to

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:10,469
say government works because that really

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:14,189
smells like it's bureaucratic but you

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:15,689
know some kind of like organization to

00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,689
ensure that kind of everything works out

00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:23,009
well but the first thing are basically

00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:25,189
the the basic tenets of what the code of

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:28,409
conduct is like this is what we expect

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:32,789
everybody to do within the community

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:36,539
whether they're posting a comment on a

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:39,210
bug report or they're on IRC or on a

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,389
mailing list or they're you know

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,969
committing code or whatever it may be

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:49,860
wherever there is a boom - these are the

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:51,990
expectations that we have and by the way

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,860
feel free to interrupt me if there's any

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,759
questions but the the first thing is to

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:04,800
be considerate so you know basically the

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,909
idea here is that together we're all

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,389
working for a common goal so we need to

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:16,680
certainly consider other people's

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:19,319
feelings and opinions and attitudes and

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,560
so certainly you know one of the things

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,349
that's really important is you know the

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,330
language that we use making sure that

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,659
that language is inclusive making sure

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,269
that that language isn't offensive and

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:36,539
you know if you sit around an IRC for a

00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:40,919
while and variably somebody will say

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:45,209
something innocently offensive and you

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,730
know somebody will pop out a link to the

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,810
code of conduct because though it may be

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,730
innocent you know a little expletive

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,880
about why bluetooth isn't working for

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,130
example

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,260
it certainly could be offensive to some

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:06,880
people the next point is being

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,700
respectful and I I kind of want to again

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,920
use contentious words just like

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:19,260
government and that's professionalism

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,840
obviously you know a boon to is a

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,080
project you know kind of held up

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,290
together by you know the bootstraps and

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,590
we're all sort of working together for

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:37,420
the purpose of creating this whole thing

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:39,670
but it is you know an environment and

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,620
where we need to be respectful of one

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,760
another and work together with one

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,590
another you know sometimes people have

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,120
differing priorities as far as what they

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,190
might want and just ensuring that those

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,910
discussions or conversations surrounding

00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:00,790
those are are dealt with with you know

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,770
respectfully rather than becoming a

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,850
personal issue that's that's an

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,620
important thing there the third thing is

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,990
taking a responsibility for our actions

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,460
and our words that one's kind of obvious

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,600
the fourth one is to be collaborative

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:24,780
and I really like this one a lot because

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,300
I think it sets that expectation that

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:32,170
everybody is somebody we depend on in

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,420
some way or another in a very meta way

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:39,910
with the boon to you can look at it as

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:45,070
how we depend on the boots on Debian and

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:47,470
what Debian does and we depend on the

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,470
upstream developers of all all of the

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,420
various different projects you know for

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,670
example we have the gnome desktop well

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,220
you know the upstream developers of

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:02,830
gnome are important collaborators of

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:07,000
ours and furthermore downstream accounts

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,680
to a Linux Mint for example they're

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,720
basically taking

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,509
- and kind of changing it around a

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,790
little bit or adding a little a bit to

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,220
it they're also collaborators of ours

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,290
and so you know working with those

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:27,759
people in mind I think is really

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:31,529
important as well the fifth point is to

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:36,790
value decisiveness clarity and consensus

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:41,949
and I think that relates a lot to the

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:43,629
idea of you know being considerate being

00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:46,869
respectful being collaborative it kind

00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,749
of pulls it all together with the notion

00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:54,009
that we're always working towards

00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:57,490
resolving issues and and coming together

00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:59,889
on a decision so that we can move the

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:04,360
project forward rather than getting

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:11,730
stymied by arguments about things and

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:16,059
that also has a a clause in it that

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,639
deals with what to do in the event that

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:21,160
that doesn't happen which is to escalate

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:26,800
it to leadership which again is that as

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:29,079
a second section the sixth part of the

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,929
code of conduct is to ask for help when

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,879
unsure so it's good to ask questions not

00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:35,079
everybody knows everything I've

00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,730
certainly learned a lot of things

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,889
through the bunch of community and

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:46,300
sometimes I feel like you know I have

00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:48,579
questions to ask that are well well

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,379
underneath the experience of people

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:55,059
around me but you know I think if we're

00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,819
working collaboratively we're more than

00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:00,939
willing to help people with those

00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:03,730
questions and then finally to step down

00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,230
consider considerately so you know if

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,100
you decide you want to leave or

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:12,279
disengage do it nicely so when I story

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,799
short whole thing is be nice but you

00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,939
know those definitely expound upon that

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:22,000
in a way that's that's SuperDuper clear

00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:25,600
yeah it sounds like where I

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,140
sorry so it sounds like beriberi abuse

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,380
and very basic but it's not in a project

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,320
with millions of users thousands of

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,060
contributors it's impossible to like

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,620
everybody it's impossible to be nice

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:45,190
every day there are some bad days and

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:49,990
well these are the rules to how to deal

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:53,830
when those things happen and they don't

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:59,050
happen often but they happen sometimes

00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,450
and we are dealing with with a few of

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,510
them at this time so that's why we

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,810
wanted to bring it to our people's

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:10,120
attention and we have found a lot of

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,850
problems with the code of conduct not

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,110
not with the rules but with how to

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,060
communicate it with everybody like make

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,800
it obvious that if you are involved in

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,010
the winter community we have high

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,460
expectations of your behavior like we

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:31,000
can understand sometimes things go wrong

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,700
and sometimes things get people get

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,310
frustrated and there's a lot of passion

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,220
we do it we do this because we love it

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:43,210
it's not because of the money it's not

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,730
because of the fame or anything it's

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:50,220
because it's very fun and it's very

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:57,120
interesting and it's very useful so yeah

00:14:50,220 --> 00:15:00,130
follow the rules be nice yeah absolutely

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,260
and I and I think that you know we've

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:07,690
had a little discussion about just kind

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:12,310
of making note of the code of conduct in

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:15,600
more places most of the canonical and I

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,490
say that with a lowercase C channels on

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,740
IRC if you join them you'll get a note

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,089
about IRC guidelines which references

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,800
the code of conduct that's really good

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,010
but you know I mean there's other places

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,730
where you know we could leave that to

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:35,370
and and further emphasize it the other

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,650
thing to the

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:43,530
we were talking about recently is the

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:50,430
fact that for an abuti membership you

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:55,800
have to use pretty good privacy to sign

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:57,360
the code of conduct which is kind of an

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,510
interesting thing because it's kind of

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:06,510
like a sort of a way of more explicitly

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:09,750
recognizing the code of conduct and also

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,000
perhaps maybe accepting a little bit

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,540
more responsibility to guide people

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,810
about it and introduce it to new people

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,050
and how people understand it and I think

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,760
you know regardless of a boon to

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,130
membership the more that we can kind of

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,260
encourage people to do that for that

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,580
purpose I think that would would further

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:37,070
help our community we were talking a lot

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:42,210
actually over the last week about this

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:44,270
but it's it sounds cool like if you sang

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,280
the count of count the code of conduct

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:52,170
we have even higher expectations like

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,990
you read it you agreed to it and you

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,560
will help us enforce it like when people

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:02,270
get misaligned with the objectives of

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,800
the community you will try your best to

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:12,690
in a nice way try to resolve the problem

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:15,810
and if it's not possible to find a good

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,780
solution like at the time that

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,390
discussion escalated and for that we

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,459
also need to get better at communication

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,500
like we are the Community Council and we

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,160
are open to hear from everybody from the

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,670
community like any kind of problems

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,580
that's our job that's what people

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:41,670
elected us to do so over the next year

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,580
we will be working on making that code

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:48,760
of conduct more obvious like appearing

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,730
everywhere like pervasive and

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,160
we will work on making our processes

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,260
more transparent to make people feel

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,420
that they can just jump into this call

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,480
and say what they want or if they want

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,690
to have a private chat with one of us we

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,200
will be always there it's working

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,210
progress so we will also accept help

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,610
from anybody in the community if you

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:17,740
have ideas on how to improve we want to

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:23,230
add anything out of conduct

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,900
Walter no I just think you know it's a

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:32,410
it's a crucial element of our community

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:35,170
it's how we work without it there's a

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:38,590
lot of room for issues especially with

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,600
as you said how broad the overall open

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,440
to community all of its collaborators

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,770
all of its stakeholders are it's it's a

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:52,030
necessary thing it's really important

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,330
and you know it is something that this

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,880
is actually the second version of it

00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:01,000
it's a community effort in and of itself

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,920
so I mean certainly I just want to like

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,290
make it super duper clear that if

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,940
anybody has any suggestions or any

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,590
questions about it things that need to

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,360
be clarified stuff that doesn't make

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,290
sense

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,090
situations that they're not sure how it

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,430
applies definitely bring it up to us

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,990
because those are things that we need to

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:25,510
work on resolving actually do we have a

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,190
launchpad project for the code of

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,270
conduct yeah yeah

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:35,260
Charice so you could always file bugs

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:38,430
against it that counts - yeah it's an

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:42,880
evolution and as the community evolves

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:45,520
our rules need to evolve too so we can

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,550
change and I really really think the

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,510
code of conduct is what half has kept us

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:55,360
alive like this is a technical project

00:19:52,510 --> 00:20:00,700
and there are a lot of interesting

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,230
technical solutions to hard problems and

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,910
that's important too

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,950
but the only way to combine them into a

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:14,200
consistent operating system that makes

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:17,050
sense is to work together nice

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,920
so take a look if you haven't signed the

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,830
code of conduct try to sign it that

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,880
would be nice

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:30,160
we have we have a new member in the call

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:40,900
Marcin are you here with us

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:44,800
you have just hey are you can you please

00:20:40,900 --> 00:21:00,180
tell us your name and what do you do why

00:20:44,800 --> 00:21:04,660
are you here in the call I'm gonna wind

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:11,170
another another young student doing

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:14,020
amazing things these past weeks so we

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,990
talked a little about signing the code

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:20,020
of conduct and we want to membership and

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,260
an important part of this is the local

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,710
teams local community teams and they

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,570
encourage people to start contributing

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,420
they are closer geographically and

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,230
closer culturally and speak the same

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,810
language so it's a very important thing

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:43,060
to the community and we had the election

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:46,390
of the new local council what two weeks

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,140
ago three weeks ago and we have Gustavo

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,450
here who's a member of the new council

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,600
so why don't you tell us how things are

00:21:52,450 --> 00:22:01,420
going Gustavo are you still here with us

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:04,500
yeah and when I type it's a huge mess so

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:08,470
I don't want to bother you guys

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:12,660
yeah regarding the local council so it's

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,550
frankly a new experience to me because

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:20,100
at least I take it a little more

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:22,800
seriously and then maybe you can expect

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,880
from it but I think it's a very

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,580
important team in the limited community

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,640
because it can help other locals to stay

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,260
active and you know and stay productive

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,890
which was something that we experienced

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,210
here in in Portugal in our in our local

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:44,970
community it hasn't been much time since

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,230
we started actually and the first week

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:51,720
or so we we were organizing ourselves

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,300
you know passing information to each

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,900
other and we have to as far as I

00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,780
remember two experienced guys in the

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,110
council so they were telling us where

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,740
the information is and what we should do

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:11,190
what we should expect the first meeting

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:16,320
was last Monday first ever meaning of

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:20,310
this new council was last Monday which

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:25,590
went pretty fine very straightforward we

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:31,020
had the chance to do one two three six

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:33,630
three verifications of local local

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,240
verifications this is sound this sounds

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,640
redundant but the process is logos can

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,600
apply it to be known or called as

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,820
verified which is a state that says okay

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,120
this logo is active they are productive

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:54,930
they do things that deserve more merit

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,920
and we give on to community recognize

00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,740
their efforts okay can you tell us which

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,880
were those lovers yeah it was the

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,990
Arizona local team Mayan Mar I think

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,120
that's hi spellings

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:15,860
not exactly sure it was the venezuelian

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:19,250
local team the Tunisian Portugal and the

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,250
Switzerland team

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,799
two of these were postponed for the next

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:31,210
two months because we thought that they

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,340
should work on their front pages of

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,159
their team just to update the things a

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,830
little because I mean they're active but

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,789
they just don't have the information up

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,559
and we thought that they should the

00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,710
remaining teams were accepted you can

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,809
check the logs in the I'll post a link

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,919
to the IRC because we have them from

00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:57,820
that information there yeah

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,639
this took some time because we looked we

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,980
looked at each application thoroughly

00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:05,710
not just you know okay this sounds

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,669
active just let it go we took it a bit

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:13,620
seriously and we try to make sure that

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:17,679
only active local teams were accepted

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,970
and yeah we're now we are thinking of

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:24,820
creating a tool like you know a Python

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,220
bot or something like that just to try

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,740
to get in touch with teams automatically

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,769
when they're when they're validations

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,710
are expiring in two months just a heads

00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:40,389
up information and also a way for us

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:42,070
control if we can expect them to apply

00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:44,139
again or not because this is something

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,169
that is happening often

00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:51,039
I mean teams somehow forget to reapply

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:53,049
and we lose verified local teams and of

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,760
course that we want as many as we can

00:25:53,049 --> 00:26:01,929
get and yeah I think that pretty much

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:06,460
sums up the two or three weeks of work

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:09,570
in a new a new local council and the

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:13,240
last meeting that we had on Monday oh

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,389
great work six teams already on the

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,830
first meeting well let's hope that we

00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:22,389
can give them really four of them are

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,580
already accepted because they had

00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:27,250
everything up to date and it seems

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,100
stable and active with all the other to

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,330
still have some work to do

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:37,230
I'm really hoping and expecting them to

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:39,389
nail it in the next next validation I've

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,259
never been able to get my Costa Rican

00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:47,279
team approved I need to work on that you

00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:52,259
should you should yeah in touch with you

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:55,639
to get some guidance good ways and maybe

00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:58,799
a good egg to suggest who to talk to you

00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:00,570
yeah you can try to reach anyone in

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,100
accountant really as I think that

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:07,500
everybody is pretty okay with that there

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,230
is a there is some information out there

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,190
how to prepare an orb rather how you

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,470
should prepare before these these

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,269
meetings but there's also the

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,659
possibility to get in touch with any of

00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:24,830
the five of the council I can I can send

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:27,480
a link to the IRC so that you can see

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,129
who is in the council let me just try to

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,080
search for that or I can I can search

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,669
for the link later when I pass the word

00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
to someone else but yeah of course you

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,659
can get in touch with anyone in the

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,529
council to get some guidance or maybe

00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:42,870
just you know ask for help if there is

00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:49,080
anything wrong or that you think that is

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:52,320
wrong you know let's let's do this this

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,379
year December next year will be the

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,470
party of the approval of the Costa Rican

00:27:55,379 --> 00:28:02,490
team you can have a parallel I mean come

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:04,940
on I have a lot of things to do it's

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:09,899
better to ollie

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,669
yeah it's a good day you should package

00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:20,700
it into a snap so that everybody can do

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:22,769
it really easy yeah so thanks a lot

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,970
boost our thanks to their team really

00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:29,549
like your help is really appreciated we

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,190
will be working together for two years

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:36,059
the new Community Council and the new

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:39,529
local council now let's see what's crazy

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:42,350
and interesting things we get going

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:46,559
thank you very much

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:49,710
all right and that's the second topic of

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,760
our agenda so for the third topic we

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:56,210
want to talk with these young people

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,070
that are participating on Google Code

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:04,070
the start I mentioned a little about

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:10,080
protein which it's an amazing project

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:12,120
there are mentors that try to people

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,480
getting started into the software and

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,570
guide them on useful things the idea is

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,179
not to just do busy work but things that

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:25,650
are useful for our projects for the

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:28,950
community and for learning so I don't we

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:32,340
go and make a round with the three of

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:36,210
you where you tell us like the tasks

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:39,440
that you are involved the things you

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:43,320
have learned and maybe there are many

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,410
free software projects around so why you

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,840
want to why are you in in this community

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:54,150
what brought you here

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:57,419
and we can start from the left Jake can

00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:00,000
you start and so I got involved with it

00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:04,710
because I'm my dad listens to the punty

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,380
podcast and yeah they talked about now

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:13,650
and he told me about it so it must be so

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:17,070
proud of you yeah um so yeah I am I've

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:20,179
just done one knee bungee task as my

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:25,140
first one which was to make a snap of

00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:27,000
Python application which I found really

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:33,840
good because I didn't rename or a snap

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:37,740
was and yeah well what I was amazing

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,190
did you miss could cheat and it lets you

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,830
and like run the cheek yeah you run the

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:46,919
cheek commands and then passing like

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,299
Taro's another command that you I forgot

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,980
how to use and then it will give you

00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,160
like a small cheat sheet on how to use

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,160
it

00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:00,659
sorry water I interrupted you I'm I just

00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,549
I just wanted to know how easy it was to

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,349
create a snap for you since it was your

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,590
first time doing it um I found it really

00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:09,599
easy because you just do the made the I

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,529
was using this tool called snap craft

00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,359
which that's you make a config file and

00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:18,570
then he put in all the steps that you

00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,999
need to do to install it and run the

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:25,440
thing and it all make it play very easy

00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:27,979
I love this application because the

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,970
example is with tar and how to

00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:35,729
uncompress something which is something

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,649
I can never get right the first time

00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:40,950
so I always have to go to stack overflow

00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:43,950
and see the order of the arguments no

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:50,249
longer I will just write it until I

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:55,049
memorize it it's not going to be very

00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:58,559
useful we can go back to you talk a

00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:01,049
little more about your participation in

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,919
a few minutes but let's see correct

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:08,249
can you tell us about your experience

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:13,859
yeah I just boom - because person

00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:17,879
basically is my main operating system so

00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:20,460
the choice bots quite natural as I said

00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:24,029
I started doing tasks less than two

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,440
weeks ago so it's quite late but I've

00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:31,619
done tasks related to snaps so I think

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:36,239
finishing the tutorials and packaging

00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:43,259
and publishing a few snaps or b5 these

00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:46,169
tasks were very great and what's not and

00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:52,559
basically making a snap was for me

00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:54,659
really easy and intuitive so can you

00:32:52,559 --> 00:33:01,919
tell us a few of the names of the snaps

00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:06,359
you wrote you package yes it's markdown

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,960
books so it's not which makes HTML book

00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,060
from

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,870
markdown files the second one is

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:16,320
markdown link which just checks markdown

00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:20,790
files for issues I've also made a snap

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,950
for to FA it's a command line tool which

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:27,330
supports to fact a two factor of

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:34,920
authentication also I've made a snap for

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:38,040
TCP TCP I P is re adjusts every part you

00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:42,840
want so quite a sink photo and the last

00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:49,800
one is to cheat i switched some data

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,220
assets create also amazing work thanks a

00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,130
lot

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,420
and we hope to continue seeing all of

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:59,910
you in the community i hope that the

00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:05,940
decoding will stop but we will still be

00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:33,720
seeing you around yeah martin how about

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:35,790
you so i yeah what what do you think

00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,560
about the tutorials that's a new thing

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:43,260
we added this year to the community and

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,480
some of the tasks of google coding are

00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,920
like write a tutorial translate a

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,130
tutorial but we have found them very

00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:56,100
useful for getting people started like

00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,410
instead of teaching the same thing over

00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,130
and over again every time somebody new

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:04,170
comes we tell them go and follow this

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,960
tutorial and then come back if you have

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,450
questions and then we can continue doing

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,770
things that are more interesting because

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:15,450
you already have the basic knowledge so

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,090
what do you people think about the

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,890
tutorial how how useful have you found

00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:24,790
them

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:32,520
I'm I found them really useful that's

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:36,310
right there's there's a little delay

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:42,520
hangouts always so it's hard to agree

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:45,340
who goes first we get we get used to it

00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:50,610
I like repeat my first word two times

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:54,160
until I'm sure I can I can't talk well

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:58,690
it let us connect every corner of the

00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,210
world so we we deal with it why don't

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,920
you go first chick and then we can go

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,230
back to Martha mercy

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,600
yeah I find it I'm really useful with

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,550
the tutorials because that's you sort of

00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,080
see how to do it and I prefer like in

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,180
text because then he can go through it

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:18,610
like a your own pace then I'm with a

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:21,190
video um yeah oh that's a good point

00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,500
will to have videos so you didn't like

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,150
the videos you preferred that tutorials

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:31,930
I didn't know that there was any

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:34,680
actually okay so it would be great if

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:39,160
you check them out it's on youtube.com

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,510
slash snap craft IO and like give us

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,870
your honest opinion

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:47,410
it's very useful to hear from people who

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:50,800
prefer text than video and start

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:56,320
planning accordingly too much too much

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:58,510
what the community needs all right

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:04,930
Marcy you were going to say something

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:19,900
about the tutorials they are useful in

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:22,590
debate and probably the most is it was a

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:27,480
happy coincidence that they were ready

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,480
just in time for this code

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:47,120
disciplines mainly Shiva so all right I

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:49,220
lost my connection a little but if if

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,990
people watching this want to take a look

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,760
at what's what available tutorials are

00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:59,690
you can go to tutorials go to come to

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,030
the club there are programming tasks but

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,250
they are there are also like halation

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,420
tasks to help you getting started from

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,410
the very basic things

00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:14,120
there are even tutorials for how to use

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:17,870
Windows to bootstrap and start using

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,020
Ubuntu or how to package applications

00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:23,120
using Windows which is a little weird

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:27,320
and crazy ting that we are now trying

00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,000
and there will be more about it and we

00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,140
need more tutorials so if you are good

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,470
writing technical documentation give it

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,470
a try

00:38:48,220 --> 00:39:06,020
sorry I couldn't hear you at all can you

00:38:51,230 --> 00:39:09,980
repeat that please for Ubuntu

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:15,230
organization about Windows and the best

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:18,680
teachers the best path could be to to

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:24,620
persuade the window either to different

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:29,750
people - yeah yeah that would definitely

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:36,800
be a good task yeah find your freedom

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:41,200
people Walter you are being a mentor

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,200
right can you tell us about your yes

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,610
I've done very little actually my

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,970
intention is to put some things on there

00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,530
for

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,860
- and I've just been really busy with

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,180
other things and haven't so there will

00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,000
be some things coming on there from

00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:02,150
moving in - most likely specifically

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,110
focusing on testing is always a fun

00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:09,320
thing to do but also we're working on

00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:12,470
the development of a QT version of our

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:15,880
desktop so testing out some of the some

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,230
of the new stuff there might be cool and

00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,520
actually just to mention something on

00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:28,340
IRC that I'll be adding a task to find

00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:31,100
the code of conduct and there's still

00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,700
time I'm thinking for snap craft that we

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:38,780
need to refresh the available tasks

00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:43,270
because there's one one student who said

00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:48,080
I'm I completed all of the vegetable

00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:53,330
snapping tasks so we need to figure out

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,550
some more challenging things to do do

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:59,420
you have any suggestions like you have

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:03,760
already completed a few or many of the

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:06,110
tasks in many of the of the tutorials so

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,440
do you have something that you would

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,440
like to work on that's not available I

00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,680
was going to say hey you could always

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,040
propose something challenging like I

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,240
don't know something that has this

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,250
clause and a variety of different

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:34,100
services but that you know kind of also

00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:38,380
violates the notion I think of Google

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:42,470
Code in kind of being bite-sized tasks

00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:45,710
yeah I don't know if it's a violation we

00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:53,090
can explore that I I recently started

00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:57,620
loving the chat BOTS and we have one or

00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:59,099
two on the snappy channel so that's like

00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,619
on

00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:07,949
like an unlimited unlimited project you

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,709
can always add more comments and the

00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:14,359
commands can run anything that you can

00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:18,440
think so I think I will spend my my

00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,729
vacations my holidays thinking about

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,880
some of the things I would like to see

00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:26,880
but I haven't been able to to do because

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:32,489
of the short time available and maybe

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:35,999
one of you can take those tests and I

00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:38,009
have seen people doing our sample

00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:40,789
requests we have like 10 new

00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:47,160
contributors to the snap craft codebase

00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:52,410
so we need to start we started saying

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:56,009
that people can fix bite size box on

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:58,289
snap craft as part of the little coating

00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:01,739
but now I'm thinking we can actually

00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:07,199
start giving them like medium complexity

00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:09,359
boxing and start seeing what they create

00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,180
like something not not very specified

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:18,499
something that you have to research and

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,499
make up and iterate that could be from

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:27,959
yeah I mean you can always add half that

00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:30,239
that you know fewer people get involved

00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:32,099
in and you can leave a little warning as

00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,690
this is like an intermediate task

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:39,209
you know maybe give an idea of like a

00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:45,509
minor something like that it doesn't

00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:53,009
hurt to add extra tasks yeah it's a lot

00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:57,239
of fun and we have talked already for 45

00:43:53,009 --> 00:44:02,099
minutes which is a lot we need to talk a

00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:05,759
little about about meta about this this

00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:08,910
meeting because it was usually on the

00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,799
third Friday of each month until we

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,290
decided to make it the second Friday of

00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:15,680
each month

00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:19,990
cause the freaking could close the

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,580
holidays and people might be away and

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:27,080
now I'm thinking that the third Friday

00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:31,370
is little weird like why don't we move

00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,650
it to the last Friday of each month that

00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:39,890
sounds like easier to put in a in a

00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:41,390
poster and to get people involved what

00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:46,880
are you suggesting that we do the first

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:48,530
and last well no I don't think I don't

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,150
think we should do too

00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:57,110
yet because we will start repeating

00:44:53,150 --> 00:45:02,480
people and topics and maybe at some

00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:05,630
point but probably not yet I'm saying

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,140
just the last Friday for now

00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:10,580
can you does it work for you what is it

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:17,990
yeah works fine for me did you check the

00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:19,400
fridge calendar I did no why is there

00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:23,290
something on the matter that there's

00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:27,140
nothing else well I mean you know my

00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:29,930
ideal is that there's nothing else

00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,100
conflicting for people you know where

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,240
whatever they're involved in can

00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:37,610
participate all right well we have a lot

00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,340
of time so we can discuss if we want to

00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:45,500
make the next one on the second third or

00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:50,180
fourth week of January we can discuss it

00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:54,160
on the hub the stubble you're working

00:45:50,180 --> 00:46:01,670
with locals and with your local portugal

00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:04,010
community and how how possible do you

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,540
see that for January we will have some

00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:10,370
real life

00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:14,720
Ubuntu hours like people meeting in some

00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:18,380
place and doing installations or

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,010
giving support to each other you mean

00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,650
you mean in Portugal only well or in any

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:27,999
local that I know of

00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:32,799
let's start with Portugal are you going

00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:36,369
to organize okay I wouldn't say for

00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:40,390
January but but here's the thing

00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:43,930
the Portuguese logo is basically split

00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:47,049
into two regions so we have a northern

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:50,559
region which is only me basically and

00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:53,799
then have the South guys that they meet

00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:57,400
at least once a month in two different

00:46:53,799 --> 00:47:00,670
places but the the event that they they

00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,460
organize it's more like a idea said it's

00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:06,039
just a social meeting so together around

00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:09,539
they talk about a bone to have a few

00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:13,539
beers and burgers and so on and so forth

00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:16,180
but I think that we could do something

00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:20,380
more interesting to people outside

00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:23,559
Ubuntu world and I wanted to you know

00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,900
ask around other locals see their events

00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,940
on their pages and see what they do to

00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:32,619
see if there is any kind of event that

00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:36,039
we could organise maybe in my region and

00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:39,339
in theirs and one of those is the

00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:42,339
installation parties as I I don't know

00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,989
if that's a no-name around but I like to

00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:48,519
call it that way just the installation

00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:53,049
party we call them install fists yeah I

00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:55,509
have that too right so I want to do that

00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:58,059
and I don't want to compromise with a

00:47:55,509 --> 00:48:00,400
timeline because I'm you know too much

00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:04,089
alone organising this so I have to find

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,609
a place and you know you're putting

00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:11,950
pressure to me to get the local verified

00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:13,900
before December you're giving yourself a

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:19,809
mean a year and you're asking me to do

00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:22,619
this and like one month or so let's

00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:25,359
let's take it slowly

00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:28,479
yeah that's in my personal plans I

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,999
definitely want to do that and you know

00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:33,819
tell people around if they want to

00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:36,790
install Kubuntu they have someone that

00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:39,970
they can reach out to if they get stuck

00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:42,820
we're in case they you know find any

00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:46,180
sort of difficulties but I want also

00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:49,450
wanted on to bring the South gas to to

00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,610
this this region of the country and have

00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:55,720
them meet me and potentially other

00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:59,940
people that we don't know yet I know

00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:03,630
have some fun have new ovens years and

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:07,390
increase our local that would be the

00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:12,370
most wanted goal of 2018

00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:13,120
for sure awesome yeah interesting year

00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,520
ahead

00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:19,750
it's it has been this year has been

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,920
right I'm I'm thankful to all of you but

00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:26,800
the next year I think will be amazing

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,920
we have we have a task in google coating

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,250
which is to organize an Ubuntu our in

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:38,110
your school but I didn't know how

00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:42,190
realistic that was so Jake Conrad and

00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:42,550
Marcin are your classmates interested at

00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,310
all

00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:51,150
do they know what to boon to us or are

00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:53,560
you d the outliers and all the ones

00:49:51,150 --> 00:50:01,480
supporting the revolution on your

00:49:53,560 --> 00:50:09,640
school's I I didn't think many people in

00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:14,230
my school know about it ready yeah that

00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:16,810
complicates things if they are just not

00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:20,680
interested but I don't know maybe we can

00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:27,190
find some resources print a few posters

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:29,200
or distribute flyers and you just put

00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:33,070
them in a corner and see if people take

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:37,420
them maybe a few will get interested or

00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:40,120
maybe not yeah and I'm not see I think

00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:44,820
it probably wet raise awareness about it

00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:49,500
as well sorry

00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:52,020
I I didn't understand my English is not

00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,410
good enough and after 50 minutes I start

00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:59,820
losing the the track of what's happening

00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:03,170
can you repeat this yeah so I think it

00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:06,930
with them like get people to sort of

00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:13,710
look out for Ubuntu and like it's like

00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:17,430
so nobody is right if you have ideas of

00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:20,160
how we could help you getting your

00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:24,240
friends interested or finding new

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:27,540
friends from your region that might be

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,180
also happy to to contribute to that

00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:34,920
would be awesome because the things that

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,840
you can do alone are like cool but once

00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,420
you get together and start hacking with

00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,640
three other people on something that's

00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:45,090
interesting to you it's not like

00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:49,500
multiplying your work by three it's like

00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:53,790
it's exponential it just explodes in its

00:51:49,500 --> 00:52:02,420
to awesome places Corot are you still

00:51:53,790 --> 00:52:05,100
here with us maybe maybe not

00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:08,370
Merson any last words

00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,690

00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:26,730

I think the younglings are shy now we

00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:31,100

internet to be honest me and marching

00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:38,280
