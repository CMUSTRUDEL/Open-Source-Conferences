why hello everybody welcome to another a

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,509
bun to community team QA probably the

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,510
last one of the year since we're gearing

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,609
up for holiday breaks coming up today

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,050
you've got me Michael whole thing we can

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,359
say it's not lost one of the year and

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,039
then drop off cuz anything have them do

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,050
one maybe we could do that yes it's one

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,360
of those co-workers is our manager we

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,340
probably shouldn't like I said my name

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,200
is Michael Hall I work on the community

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,590
team here at canonical and with me as

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,890
Alan Pope who works on the same team

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,390
hello so if this is your first time

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,430
watching I hope you're watching on a bun

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,840
to on-air calm because you'll have our

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,879
nice little video here and right below

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,039
it you'll have an embedded IRC chat

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,989
window where you can join the chat talk

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,449
to other people who are watching and ask

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,770
us any questions that you might have the

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,719
way that works is you start your

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,420
question with the word question in all

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,010
capital letters and that way it turns a

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,920
nice bright yellow for me and I don't

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,570
miss it we will try and get to as many

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,670
of them as we can and the order that

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,710
they come in keep in mind that there is

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,900
about a minute delay between when we

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,220
record the video and when you see the

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,189
video so don't wait until the last

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,630
minute to get questions in you can ask

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,009
questions at any time like I said

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,290
welcome back to them after we go through

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,790
a round of updates I know there's

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,780
already quite a few coming in and that's

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,430
fine go ahead and keep them coming in

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,140
the meantime we'll get to some

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,150
announcements I mentioned earlier that

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,880
we've got a holiday break coming up

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,740
canonical essentially shuts down for a

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,750
little while between Christmas and New

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,060
Year's so there's not going to be a lot

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,630
of people online starting next week

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,590
there may or may not be another QA next

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,090
week depending on who's around to do it

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,430
but for everybody else expect us back

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,430
probably the first full week of January

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,360
all right on one big announcement that I

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,820
want to bring up I know we've been

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,520
pushing it a lot is the Ubu con that's

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,960
coming up in January that's January 21st

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,480
and 22nd in Pasadena California Ubu cons

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,640
are a grassroot community-led effort to

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,950
provide regional conferences focusing

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,990
specifically on a bun to and for this

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,700
one we've got a lot more going on

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,530
Canonical's going to have a much bigger

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,080
presence in this one than we have in

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,430
past new boo cons including having mark

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,580
shuttleworth they are giving a keynote

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,530
and participating in a panel we're going

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
to have a lot of canonical people there

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,610
and a lot of community people there so

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,260
it's a good thing to attend if you're in

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,080
the area or you can travel down to

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,780
Southern California it's being co-hosted

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,850
with the Southern California Linux expo

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,670
which is a huge show probably the

00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,000
biggest show in North America for open

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,380
source software so that's the four days

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,440
from the 21st through the 23rd do I

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,420
think so if you come to Abu Khan be sure

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,120
to stay for that we have a registration

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,850
page up on bukan orga just posted the

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,620

please register there that lets us know

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,430
how many people are going to be there

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,550
we're trying to arrange some different

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,290
events a social event after party that

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,120
kind of thing and knowing how many

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,920
people are going to be there is going to

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,920
be a big help in the planning for that

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,489
all right Alan did you want to talk

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,489

contributed there are some prizes are

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:08,260
provided by google themselves for you

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,280
know certain levels of contribution and

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,690
that have been attained by the students

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,090
and we have a whole bunch of mentors in

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,300
the ubuntu community a few from

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,640
canonical view from outside canonical

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,220
who can help people get started and

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,510
we've got an IRC channel which is hash

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,470
12 hyphen Google on freenode drop by

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,350

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,360
involved as a whole bunch of us lurking

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,390
in that channel and you can have a look

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,640
at the tasks that are RM available at

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:44,200
toad in with google com i also if you're

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,200
a member of the ability community and

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,110
there are tasks that you think would be

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,180
good for someone to contribute to bury

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,700
my knees need to be you know something

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,860
that's doable by someone between the age

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,169
of 13 17 generally

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,580
at their computer contributing in some

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,490
way doesn't necessarily have to be code

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,080
the whole other categories for different

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,639
types of contribution code is just one

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,110
of them there are other things like

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,729
writing documentation we bug triaging

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,849
making videos yet there's all kinds of

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:18,370
different ways to contribute and yet

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:19,750
drop my IRC channel and ask questions or

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,300
just have a look at some of the tasks on

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,039
the website if you are online if you're

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,939
interested in becoming a mentor and

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:31,990
helping meant all those new students

00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:35,830
then we welcome experienced mentors from

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,060
them into community as well I think

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,740
that's everything or what is server that

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,509
runs from December the seventh so from

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:49,870
last week until January the 25th next

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:51,189
year look some weird yeah I know what

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,120
happens when he gets to the end of the

00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:56,800
year and then once we get into January

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,810
we're going to have several weeks where

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,800
we're still putting 2015 on the end of

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,629
every date or you know the beginning of

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,469
every day for those who use a decent

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:10,449
date format unit for those who have a

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,490
sane way of formatting date strings yes

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,129
never never miss an opportunity to have

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:20,229
a staff about my American page format is

00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:21,789
my motto there's plenty of formats and

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:26,529
measurements you can have a stab at

00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:28,419
their greevey I well with the questions

00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:31,360
or anything else you always car I've got

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,610
another announcement last week will cook

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,159
from the desktop team announced that we

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,580
are disabling the online scopes in unity

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:42,759
seven starting in the 16 before release

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,379
so when you go to your dash home you are

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,120
no longer going to have all of the

00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:49,750
online scopes being searched it'll just

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,759
be your local scopes so that's taking a

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,469
plate taking effect now I think the

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,779
changes just landed so if you're running

00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,659
the development release of ubuntu that

00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:01,409
you will already have that take effect

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,409
if you are

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,320
if you have already disabled it or made

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,020
any other changes when you upgrade to

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,310
1604 those changes will be preserved

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,660
we're not going to go back and change

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,740
anything but if you've left it as

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,170
default leaving the online scopes on

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,630
then when you upgrade the 1604 they will

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,910
default to off so you'll lose those but

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,130
you can opt back into those go to the

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,740
privacy settings go to the Search tab

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:34,160
and you can re-enable online scopes that

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:35,510
way all right Ellen did you want to talk

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,170
about the pebble one you mentioned that

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,360
to me earlier oh yeah I it was a just a

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,000
brief mention because I saw wayne ward

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,550
on google+ had had mentioned it maybe

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,320
you can find the post I'm while I'm

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:53,570
babbling so Michael zanetti recently

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,210
expressed interest he's a one of the

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,150
unity 8 developers working economical

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:02,120
expressed interest in getting pebble

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,750
watch working at for ubuntu phone users

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,490
so pebble watch is this kind of thing

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,920
that's one of these new SmartWatch

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,410
things that talks by a bluetooth to your

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,400
mobile device and by default it talks to

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:18,260
iOS and Android devices but Michael

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,180
wanted to enable supporting of a new

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,460
phone so you can get notifications on

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,650
your watch and see your calendar on your

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,360
watch and all the other kind of groovy

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,710
interactions that you can have on a

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,080
SmartWatch without getting your phone

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,190
out of your pocket so he started working

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,680
on that little one code and he had a

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,080
small team of beta testers testing out

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,550
and making sure it works and he's

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,340
continued to work on that wayne has

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,560
posted on Google+ a little bit about his

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,540
experience with it so if you're

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,100
interested then I'd recommend getting in

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,560
touch with MZ Nettie on IRC who can give

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,960
you all the details I think it's not

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,910
ready for primetime yet are there's some

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,410
things in the platform that are needed

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,180
which won't come until a later

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,300
over-the-air update i think you have to

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,380
wait for at least OTA nine which is mid

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,600
January next year but it's it's come a

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,980
long way in a very short period of time

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,570
zanetti is quite the machine when it

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,600
comes to development I don't know where

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,360
he finds the time but I'm glad he does

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,120
find the time so yeah there's a pebble

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,590
support coming very soon which is which

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,360
is good it's also quite nice that

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,100
there's that there's a little telegram

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,350
group so if you're on telegram you can

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,360
probably find their telegram group and

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,680
one of the people in the telegram group

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,840
is someone who actually works for pebble

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,630
and so it's quite nice that we're

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,840
getting some information from them it's

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,640
not all you know reverse engineering and

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:50,070
hidden stuff they're actually providing

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:52,920
engineer relations that's good yeah

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,110
that's always nice when the other

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,230
company is happy to be involved and help

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,480
us out yeah and it's not really it's not

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,120
official or anything it's a community

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,340
maintained piece of software but yeah

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,110
good work

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,180
alright so let's get to the questions

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,040
again you can ask questions anytime

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,350
start them with the word question and

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,510
all caps for us we actually had some

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,160
come in before we started the broadcast

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,980
so I'm going to go all the way back to

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,260
sponge who says I was speaking to an

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,210
experienced a bun to user and he said

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,040
why on God's earth did unity decide to

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,600
make it so that you could move the

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,370
clothes and minimize buttons in a

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,190
program from the top left to the top

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,200
right and chromium it's fine but in

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,320
unity it's all mucked up in the design

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,740
ethos you can't even change it in ubuntu

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,870
tweak so the primary reason for that is

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,630
because in unity when you maximize

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,780
window it integrates with that top bar

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,280
and already on the top bar on the right

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,770
hand side you have all of your

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,300
indicators so if we were to try and cram

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,740
you know the clothes and minimize

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,990
buttons in there to every time you

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,820
maximize or not it's going to move all

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,500
that stuff around so it was just cleaner

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,770
to keep it on the left-hand side where

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,180
there wasn't currently anything that

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:10,770
would conflict with the positioning of

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:13,230
those buttons yeah in fact if you have

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,750
chromium if you fit it too sorry if you

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,970
set it to you know stick the window

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,530
controls on the right drawing it itself

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,390
and then you maximize it you're still

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,920
going to get them on the left again once

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,820
it integrates with the title bar so it's

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,700
a little bit weird hmm I think it's one

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,860
of those things that you know people are

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,050
passionately feel one way or the other

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm one of those people who kind of

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,860
accept the defaults that yeah most

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,830
desktops give me and it seems to work

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,360
for me I find actually a bit weird when

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,250
I go back to a windows machine and the

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,330
buttons on the other side you know well

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,770
we've been talking about this for years

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,810
and years and years and here it doesn't

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:57,180
take very long to get used to them being

00:12:51,810 --> 00:13:01,320
on the other side either right all right

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,750
um you're going to end not just when my

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,570
eye are cee disconnected earlier when I

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,220
yet okay the channel today sorry all

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,480
right I'll ask them all and just give

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,480
the ones I don't want to answer to you

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:17,340
un cool jazz as two times my morning

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,200
alarm for wake up didn't work on a nexus

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,000
for RC proposed

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,550
that a common bug anyone else

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,020
experienced this problem so Alan you

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,690
work a lot with the core app developers

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,520
including the clock app which is

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,280
responsible for setting these have you

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,020
heard of this book recently well the

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,820
clock app is responsible for setting

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,410
them but it's not the thing that

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,300
triggers the alarm the thing that

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,950
triggers the alarm is the date time

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,630
indicator at the top of the screen so

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,580
you know it can be a bug that the clock

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,200
isn't saving them correctly or isn't

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,970
saving them in the right time zone or in

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,000
the right yeah it's some way it's not

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:58,440
right but invariably it's it's indicated

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,760
date time that's the problem i'm not

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:05,400
aware i have the alarm blaring out on my

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:10,290
phone regularly to the annoyance of my

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:14,160
family and so it works here i have a RC

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,990
proposed device as well not a nexus for

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,090
mine happens to be a BQ but i think the

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,750
software stack is the same on both so it

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:25,770
should it should work if it doesn't then

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:28,950
that's a bug and we should fill in a bug

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:31,830
report with whatever detail you can out

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,940
under what circumstances it fails try

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,410
and reproduce it and yeah we can we can

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,930
get someone to have a look at that that

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,330
indicate a date time indicator hyphen

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,350
date type is the name of the package

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,350
that you want to follow me against

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,070
alright the next one ever looks to be

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,170
for you to its core apps police he says

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,360
is there any plans to remove or fix the

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,360
Evernote integration in the Notes app

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:06,790
remove no I fix well what's broken it's

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,860
might is my question again if there's a

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,960
if there's a problem then we need to

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,200
identify what the problem is and fix it

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,210
but the the Evernote integration is

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,480
there so you can synchronize your your

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,370
notes with Evernote in the cloud

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,560
obviously that's optional by default if

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,240
you if you start the Notes app and say

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,250
no I don't want to sync my notes so it

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,290
out then all you know stay on your local

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,029
device and you know they don't

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,460
synchronize anywhere I personally use

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:37,420
Evernote and I quite like having mine to

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,089
look out so yeah if it doesn't work if

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,660
there's any any bugs there then please

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:46,330
file a bug the project or launch pad is

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,920
reminders hyphen app so feel free can

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,160
file a bug on there and we'll take a

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,160
look at

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,000
alright sponge is asking how can people

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,560
tell us can some people tell us what is

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,810
happening with a bun to TV it's

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,240
described here and he posts a link to

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,680
reddit that says that a bunch of TV is

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,440
being absorbed into a bun too personal

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,970
so a bunch of TV kind of got put on the

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,370
back burner when we started working on

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,290
phones but a lot of the work that we've

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,180
done on the phones and getting all of

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,910
that ready for the desktop is also going

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,620
to make a bun to TV a lot easier to

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,459
development because they all needed the

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,579
same foundational stuff what a bunch of

00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:33,410
personal is is a migration to combine

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:35,329
all of the end user GUI facing stuff

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,970
into one set of images so right now

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,639
you've got the bun to core images which

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,250
is used for Internet of Things devices

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,620
in the cloud and then a bun to personal

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,839
is going to be the combination of phone

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,240
and desktop and at some point in the

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,730
future also TV so they're all being

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,769
merged into this one thing that we're

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,959
kind of officially unofficially I don't

00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:00,740
even know anymore calling a bun too

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:06,260
personal the actual TV development is

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,539
still on hold once we establish a bun to

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,429
phone and get that stable and finish the

00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:12,620
transition of the desktop over to you in

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,409
88 then maybe we'll be able to come back

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,299
and look it up into TV it's also largely

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,919
going to depend on finding a hardware

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:27,740
company that wants to work with us on

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:30,440
that core apps police again asks how to

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,510
get popular popular apps from other

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,340
mobile markets is being discussed on the

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,049
mailing list and some people say make

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,270
the platform ready first then cell

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,220
phones in the stores and then the apps

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,429
will come on the other hand some users

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,530
say get funds by crowd for crowdsourcing

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:48,470
in order to pay the ports what's your

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,870
opinion on this subject Alan you want

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:57,620
that one ah is the tricky one you know

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:02,450
it so you need a stable platform you

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,900
know if you if you if users want to

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,270
decorate developers want to

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,850
create applications or port applications

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,440
either way and your platform doesn't

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,780
support the things they want to do so

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,220
let's take for example again let's say

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,180
someone wants to bring a game across

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,120
from Android or iOS two of them to there

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,850
are some big holes in our platform that

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,640
that mean that some specific games can't

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,310
easily be ported across some can and yes

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,530
um have but there are some holes that

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,930
don't let that be quite as

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,700
straightforward as going from Android to

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,700
iOS right our platform is not as mature

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,380
as this so like take for example if

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,160
you're putting a game there's no

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,790
equivalent to Game Center on on iOS or

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,120
there the whatever it is called on

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:54,450
google play the Play services that those

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,670
services yeah the lie to like

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,170
synchronize your game state between your

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,180
phone and your tablet all that kind of

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,540
stuff we just don't have that yet and so

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,010
if we went knocking on doors of game

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,400
developers and said you should bring

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,920
your your your game to our platform and

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,600
they look down their list of features

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,370
that their game has and they see big

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,010
holes that we don't have in our platform

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,330
the answers going to be no right it they

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,600
just can't they're not going to invest

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,750
huge amounts of time to re-engineer the

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,030
saving game state or whatever just for a

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:31,890
bunch of phone which has currently a

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,750
very limited set of users and an even

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,150
smaller set of people who are likely to

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,340
buy that game through which they could

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,780
recoup the cost the investment costs of

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,360
porting the game in the first place

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,190
right so that it makes no sense so I

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,590
completely agree with those who say we

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,940
should get the platform right then start

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,260
knocking on the doors of people who want

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,980
to pour things across there are other

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:56,520
things like engines like unity 3d

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,590
unity3d has an exporter for iOS for

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,100
Android for a bunch of desktop or Linux

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,330
desktop sorry playstation Nintendo Wii

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,660
and everything but it doesn't have one

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,850
for ubuntu phone so you know it would be

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,980
good if it did or it would be good if we

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,200
supported the html5 exporter that comes

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,020
in unity 3d version 5 that would be

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,900
great so yeah and

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,790
and maybe getting things like those tool

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,610
kits those engines though that

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,370
middleware ported across would bring

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:30,100
with it the developers who you know

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,980
could pull you know it's already hard

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,230
enough getting game developers to port

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,120
stuff to the Linux desktop you know it's

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,990
better now that we've got steam or less

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,900
and it's better now that many of the

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:46,750
toolkits like unreal and unity 3d have

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,580
native exporters for linux but it's

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,170
still quite a job to get people to do it

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,690
to the desktop to get them to do it 12

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,910
into phone is like a couple of orders

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,790
who orders of magnitude even harder

00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:01,090
right so I believe that we should get

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:04,570
the platform right however I do think

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,150
that we have a great SDK that we can use

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,880
for creating new and innovative

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,810
applications that compare well to

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,000
applications on other platforms so while

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:19,600
you know the the example everyone gives

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,160
whatsapp viber whatever else yeah we

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,590
don't have those we have compelling

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,910
alternatives so sometimes we can have

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:31,150
compelling alternatives I think that

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:34,300
helps yeah and you know every new OS

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,000
faces the same problem where you need a

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,890
lot of users to get these third-party

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,690
apps ported and you need these

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,300
third-party apps ported to get a lot of

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,720
users and there's no silver bullet to

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,450
make that all happen so I think the way

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,120
forward is you know there's a hundred

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,100
smaller things that we can do and each

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,830
one of those things will open up the

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,470
possibility for a small number of those

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,420
apps to be ported so you know probably

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,060
mentioned whatsapp we're we're working

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,980
now on a messaging framework that will

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:10,090
let people write messaging service

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:13,260
plugins to a single messaging app that

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:16,120
will make it possible for whatsapp to

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,070
write a plug-in for this thing instead

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,240
of writing their own full app for it so

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,000
that makes it a little bit easier for

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,640
them they don't need you know the Play

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,340
Store Google Play services or whatever

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,260
for whatsapp so we can fix that one

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,759
piece and we get one set of apps and

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,109
then we move on to fixing another piece

00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,419
that will make another set of apps

00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:36,190
possible and every time we do that we

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,779
will gain a few more users who are just

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,570
waiting on that piece of the puzzle to

00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:42,339
land before they can switch so each step

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,199
we take each little piece that we fix is

00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:45,789
going to get us a few more apps some

00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:47,979
more users and we will just grow

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,109
steadily and incrementally that way

00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,820
instead of there being you know one

00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:54,059
magical thing that will make everything

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,519
possible and bring in all of the users

00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:00,249
Anna and the silver bullet you might

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,039
think would be cold hard cash you know

00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:04,869
throw money at these at these developers

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,929
and get them to put their apps across

00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:11,649
and that hasn't necessarily worked well

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:13,690
within those fun they throw money at is

00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:15,940
V in order to get their apps put it

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,609
across but that hasn't meant that

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,809
windows phone is now you know up there

00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:24,699
with Android and iOS it's it's it's slow

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,709
and we're in this for the long game it's

00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:29,709
not you know we're not expecting this to

00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:31,389
like January next year suddenly everyone

00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,669
in your street and a bunch of phone

00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:37,479
we're realistic we know that's not going

00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:39,099
to be the case right not only do we not

00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:41,739
have the money to throw at all of these

00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:44,440
is BS to get it ported but if that money

00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:46,359
is the only motivation they had for the

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,009
port then as soon as the money dries up

00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,289
so does their support for it and I think

00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:52,389
that's why a lot of Windows apps have

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,799
been pulled from the store after being

00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,569
written was because once they weren't

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,719
being paid for it anymore they weren't

00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:00,519
going to support it or update it anymore

00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:03,249
so I think the the slow incremental

00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,769
approach and getting actual interest and

00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:08,979
buy-in to the platform itself and not

00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:12,879
just on you know a paycheck is the right

00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:14,769
way for us to go with this and on a

00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:19,469
lighter note Chloe Wolfie girl is asking

00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:22,719
us if we're excited for Christmas uh

00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:26,649
excited in the way that you know you get

00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:28,149
some time off from work personally

00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,469
speaking you know I'll spend some time

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,809
with the family they've broken up from

00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:33,429
school you may have heard earlier on

00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:35,529
clattering noises in the background my

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,139
kids playing around at home so you know

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:40,839
get to play with them a little bit

00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:43,179
probably make some Lego toys which is

00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,380
fun at Christmas time they eat some food

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,870
see my family

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,640
um and then when I get sick of the sight

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,680
of my family come back to my laptop and

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,770
start hacking on something probably so

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:58,810
ya know me yep pretty much yes they're

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,790
pretty much the same story here you know

00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:05,260
food and family that's what I'm looking

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:07,720
forward to the most and Chloe Wolfie

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,370
girl asks the obligatory question hood

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,140
on a bun to phone so John Lee on the

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,150
design team is going to be at the EBU

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:21,670
con summit in January and my plan is to

00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:24,070
buy him drinks until he's drunk enough

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:28,110
to agree to do it and then make him do

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:30,610
it we'll see how that works out

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,740
excellent I approve this this method

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:37,950
get' designers drunk to get into design

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:40,200
features what Roy scales but you know

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:46,170
it's again throwing money at a problem

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:49,300
yes throw beer a problem yes ok wha

00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:52,600
sponge is asking well asking us to tell

00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,610
him why ubuntu summit Ubu con is so

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,970
special and where do I get more

00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,950
information should I check reddit the

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,740
best place to get information is Ubu con

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,720
org we've just put up a new site that

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,670
has a lot of details on the e-book on

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,460
summit as well as some of the other Ubu

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:12,760
cons that are going on boo boo con

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,470
summit is important because it's instead

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,880
of being just a regional conference

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,130
we're trying to grow it to a global

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,060
conference to get back some of what we

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,830
had at the in-person UDS is that we had

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,750
so it's not going to be a UDS there's

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,490
not going to be a lot of development

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,870
planning going on there but it is going

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,700
to be a time where you can meet up with

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,650
people from the Ubuntu community and

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,840
from canonical from all over the world

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,310
instead of just the ones that are you

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,130
know local to wear that new boo Con is

00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,510
happening so that's going to be the main

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,800
thing we're going to have like I said

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,080
earlier we can have mark shuttleworth

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,580
they're giving a keynote and being on a

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,920
panel we're going to have other leaders

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,590
from the bun to community we're going to

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,260
be there for you to meet and talk to and

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,810
you network with

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,450
spun chesta has asked a follow-up

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:02,390
question and that is soo bacan going to

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,490
be an english or spanish on youtube the

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,520
ebu con summit is going to be all in

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,710
English some of the other Ubu cons are

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,200
in other languages Ubu con la is

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,050
typically in Spanish I think they only

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,540
had one or two English sessions this

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,210
past year and then umma Khan de and

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,000
Germany is I think mostly in German but

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:29,870
this one you bacan summit in California

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,360
is going to be in English alright many

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:40,040
ducks is asking when will there be in a

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:42,710
bunch of phone in China answer so right

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,890
now there is a is a china mobile

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,510
conference thing or a chinese mobile

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:52,550
confidence that i've seen some pictures

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:55,790
online of the last couple of days so um

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:58,750
I don't know about specific devices in

00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,310
China but I know you know there is

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:05,220
active working going on over there

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:07,880
right so my zoo is our Chinese partner

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,500
and they've released the mx4 in Europe

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,410
running a bun too but last I heard they

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,560
were still going to government

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,440
certification the equivalent of the FCC

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,770
over there to be able to sell it

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,160
actually within China so I don't know

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,260
what the status of that is but hopefully

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,910
sometime soon will be we'll have the

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,300
phone on spell there i don't know if you

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,910
can buy the BQ aquarius in china i know

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,810
you can buy it all over Europe and in

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:43,770
India and Russia al yeah I don't know I

00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:45,180
don't know and at you know I'll stand an

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,100
answer that we always give whenever

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,250
anyone asks when is this device or that

00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:53,190
device coming is you have to ask the

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,290
manufacturer of the device because you

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,600
know that's their responsibility and you

00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,730
know we do software they do the arm and

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,700
veggies

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:05,520
yeah and if if the holdup is you know

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,110
going through certification and it may

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120
not even be able to answer you it may

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,650
just be that they're waiting around for

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,570
somebody else to do something sure all

00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,490
right truly lovely says having a

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,380
good-looking fully featured Evernote

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,020
client for linux is a truly splendid

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,850
thing however the amount of love the

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,710
Notes app has been getting of late when

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,440
compared to the music and browser apps

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:33,450
seems to be relatively small are their

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:36,810
upcoming stability and UI changes do so

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:39,860
you can expect a bit of a refresh in the

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:44,790
Notes app in the coming year to make it

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:49,020
work better on a desktop and to use the

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:52,350
newer header in your toolkit and so on

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,720
we don't have any massive features lined

00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,090
up for the Notes app if people have

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,180
feature requests then probably the

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:02,010
easiest introduced file a bug and you

00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,410
know detail what you would like in that

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,720
bug for for any amount applies to any of

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,430
the core apps really we can discuss it

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,120
there it's probably the easiest thing to

00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:15,000
do all right so i call it truly love

00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:19,280
laser for you Alan the next one is all

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,280
the weather and clock apps be rotatable

00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:27,990
so at the moment the the apps that are

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,370
currently getting the most design input

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:36,570
are a calendar music and deco and we'll

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:39,890
move on to the others shortly at the

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:46,200
moment weather and clock open in

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:51,000
portrait mode on the desktop and we have

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,460
an outstanding task to design a desktop

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,680
user interface for the weather app and

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,240
the clock app so if you do start it in

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,100
portrait mode and then start dragging

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,840
the window wider you know what does it

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,760
do with that extra space do you just get

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,040
a big fat clock on the screen or you

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,990
know do you have multiple

00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,250
time zone you know clocks or what and we

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:17,050
have an outstanding to us from that so

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:18,910
yes that will change soon once we have

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,290
the designs done for it which will

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:31,180
probably be after deco calendar and

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:33,010
music alright and the third one is deco

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,560
although lovely seems to have problems

00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,260
with iCloud accounts so not really a

00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,190
question but I guess more of a bug

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:46,710
report yeah it's to em so Dan Chapman

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:50,020
whose primary developer on Deko has has

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:54,580
learnt in a kind of trial by fire how

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:56,950
how I map implementations differ from

00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,930
one provider to another so you know if

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,490
everyone used the same email provider

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,980
his job would be significantly easier

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,870
right so all you have to now move to one

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,970
email provider and then who will provide

00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,530
that will provide that in applied but

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,390
that's not realistic so everyone has a

00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,130
different email provider and they all

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:16,270
have different I'm app servers and they

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:19,090
all behave slightly differently and so

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,820
he has to cater for that and has to have

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:24,400
quirks in the application for different

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,710
providers and I know he's tackling the

00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,010
big ones first like to make sure that it

00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:33,940
works on you know outlook hotmail yahoo

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,920
gmail playing good old vanilla I'm app

00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,890
servers that you might have at your ISP

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,930
or that you know you might run yourself

00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,910
and iCloud is one of those as well I

00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,040
think it was a problem early on because

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,290
Dan didn't have an iOS device and I

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,880
think there was some requirement that

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,370
you had to sign up with an iOS device

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,410
for an iCloud account or dummy account

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,750
or something so for a long while he

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,150
wasn't able to test I town accounts I

00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,700
believe he has an account now so we can

00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,410
we can certainly make that better but

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,610
yeah work is ongoing if you have

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:08,470
specific bugs you know what to do

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,890
launchpad.net / Decker is where the

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,890
loads good

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:17,420
all right sponges does working at

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:19,190
canonical cover health insurance or is

00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,350
that an opt-out in your employment

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:26,020
scheme so this may vary depending on the

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:28,550
country and the vizha in the US we have

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,530
employer-provided health insurance that

00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,930
we opt into just like any other company

00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:37,100
in the US would do I don't know what

00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:45,050
it's like over in the UK though NHS

00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:55,400
maybe uh a very union lovely socialist

00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:57,800
medicine yes brother all right Chloe's

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,320
asking any update on Mycroft on the

00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,970
phone so I know they just updated they

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,220
posted an update on their Kickstarter

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:08,389
page but that was about them joining the

00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,730
IOT partnership with a bunt too um and

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,659
also pictures of the hob where there was

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,850
a nice service but if design exploded

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,530
design of the Mycroft I'm quite looking

00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,899
forward to that because I initially only

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,790
backed at the software level and then

00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,440
the very last minute I changed my mind i

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,970
decided to increase it so i get one of

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,250
the little one of the little micro

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:35,260
devices somebody brought to that nice um

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:38,270
the last update i heard on the phone was

00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,909
Jason New Orleans who's developing it

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,970
and he was just talking to some unity

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,620
developers about it i think on google+

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,210
so not not really an announcement just

00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,760
you know regular back-and-forth

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,879
communication i do know that Ryan sipes

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,610
the CTO of Mycroft is going to be at

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,130
rubicon summit in Pasadena and yet

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,810
another reason to go there so you can

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,610
ask him that there i'll try and corner

00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,440
him and ask him that he's also may be

00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,860
going to be bringing an actual Mycroft

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,960
unit to display at the ubuntu booth at

00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,960
scale so that'll be neat to see

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:21,680
sponge is asking where the EBU contra

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:23,060
LePage is got a link to that um I don't

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,790
know what the permission settings on

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,100
that are but if you can't see it let me

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,370
know there's nothing really exciting

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,050
there it's just us planning and

00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:36,860
scheduling work items to get it all up

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:40,880
and going I'm I've just opened that link

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:43,130
in a incognito window and it works here

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,110
so yeah I can see it all I don't know

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:48,110
yet hope so go change anything because

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:52,040
anything from yeah you can see all of

00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:55,070
our boring planning tasks on there I'm

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,280
getting bold right yes get involved is

00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:00,200
always a good thing perhaps police ask

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,990
what lessons has canonical learned from

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:08,840
fire Firefox OS it appears they're

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:10,910
quitting the mobile platform so I think

00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,070
and I don't I'm not going to speak

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:16,790
officially on this but one of the things

00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:20,570
that I think we not necessarily learned

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:23,420
from them but kind of knew all along was

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,050
that we need to grow slowly and

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,030
incrementally we need to you know target

00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,550
the people who can use the software that

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:35,270
we have now instead of trying to go

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,820
massively global and you know go after

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:40,130
average consumers right away because I

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,660
think that bit Firefox OS pretty hard

00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,840
when a lot of people got their devices

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,770
and it wasn't what they expected it to

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:53,080
be and they felt disappointed by that

00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:56,780
right and Firefox OS is eat it is a is a

00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,430
it's maybe an example of where the

00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,680
argument that people give that you know

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:04,430
when you have a ton of devices out there

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,700
the app developers will come I you know

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,680
that's not necessarily you know proven

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,490
through what happened with Firefox OS

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,050
yeah if you take that one example of you

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,450
know firefox OS devices there were

00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:20,450
multiple devices in numerous countries

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:23,570
lots of launches lots of different

00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,460
different OEMs device manufacturers and

00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:31,359
so on

00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:34,690
and bear experiment you know it could be

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,430
argued failed and and so you know

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,970
they've pulled back on mobile devices

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:42,330
and will do other things instead I I

00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:46,540
personally i think is quite sad because

00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:51,160
there was a lot of promise in Firefox OS

00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:56,020
and I like the idea of local html5 apps

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:59,440
on the device and I think it's a shame

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:04,119
that they would be set by some problems

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,660
early on like they realized early on

00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:11,910
that that well a bit late really they

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:15,280
realized that manufacturers wouldn't

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:18,400
would kind of disowned devices once the

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,240
first update went out and I think that's

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,250
something they should have seen you know

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,500
it's easy in retrospect to say that but

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:29,740
we saw that we knew that would happen

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,660
which is why we do the software updates

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,140
ourselves whereas Firefox had a

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,599
different model where you know they they

00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:40,000
expected companies like ZTE to do

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,440
updates for the devices so there's

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,099
certainly are lessons that anyone could

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,359
learn from from that and I think it's a

00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:53,240
big shame but yeah I hope the the people

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:57,630
who worked on that angle engine

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,490
okay yeah I think it losing competition

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,800
you know it might seem like it's good

00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:04,320
for us but really the more competition

00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,210
in this market space the better it is

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,330
for all of us who are trying to compete

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,720
with Android and iOS so it does it's

00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,730
kind of a shame that that happened yeah

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,380
there's some validation in the fact you

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:22,290
know multiple multiple vendors of you

00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,800
know the smaller devices like the

00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:29,190
smaller teams like us we're all doing

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,800
similar things there's some validation

00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,170
in there some would argue this you know

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,150
clearly you know if a couple of them

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,600
failed I've seen this was a blog post

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:42,060
recently that suggested that you know

00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,760
the fact that y'all are going through

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,370
financial difficulties and firefox have

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,740
pulled out that means you know we're

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,510
clearly going to give up as well and I I

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,600
don't know where that logic comes from

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,690
and it's kind of bizarre but that's not

00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,340
the case ya know and people have to

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,310
remember you know we've already got an

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,170
established desktop market and most of

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,870
the work that's going into the phone is

00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,820
also going to be going into that so it's

00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,740
not like you know it's just the phone

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:16,080
and it's make-or-break on just the phone

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,760
which is much broader range of devices

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,660
and markets that were targeting with

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,450
this development okay we've got loads of

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,240
questions lined up and many ducks asks

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:31,100
which convergent phones are showcased in

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:36,000
China and there's a link to a tweet ah I

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:38,340
have no idea i would assume that given

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,110
that we only have the convergence stuff

00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,670
working on the nexus 4 in the nexus 7

00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,500
right now i would imagine it's the nexus

00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,880
4 in nexus 7 and there may be other

00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,970
devices out there that I don't know

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,010
about up that's all I know yeah I'm sure

00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,230
that they've got some of the mx4 is on

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,160
display there but I don't know what

00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,600
they're doing with those and

00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,490
unfortunately you can't really see in

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,140
the picture what the phones are ya

00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:04,900
okay next question is for you in your

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,280
November food blog posts and talk about

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,970
women in tech would you like to talk

00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,290
about the generality on that post I

00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:13,600
really wouldn't know i mean the post

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,810
pretty but the title it basically says

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,490
everything that i wanted to say if you

00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,280
want to look into the background of that

00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:23,740
i was just annoyed by what some people

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,330
were posting on their blogs and was

00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,270
making the rounds so that was just kind

00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,070
of a reaction to that most people

00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:35,140
probably aren't going to care if you do

00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:37,510
read the blog post i question from

00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,910
dragonbyte says will possibly become be

00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:44,440
streamed online and from where i guess

00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:46,690
you mean like video audio right I don't

00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,540
know it's going to depend on what the

00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,990
scale setup has available for us I think

00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,370
the keynotes might be on video I don't

00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,290
know if they're going to be streamed or

00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,410
if they're just going to be available to

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,910
watch later I don't think any of the

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:08,230
smaller sessions are going to be

00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:11,800
recorded or streamed though okay zeagle

00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:14,200
mum asks any news on the phone with

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,190
converged hardware do we think that we

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:27,010
there by 1604 is the software on track

00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:28,720
to be ready well I think uh is the

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,600
software no we don't really have any

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,240
news I think is the short answer to that

00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,870
yeah no yeah we don't we don't have a

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:42,790
specific date or device to announce

00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:44,620
today and but equally I would I would be

00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,690
careful about saying if something is

00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,900
ready because you know we're constantly

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,690
improving stuff you know like 18 months

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,340
ago you know you could have said parts

00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,410
of it already and now things have

00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,810
improved immeasurably since then so I

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,730
mean we've had what eight stable updates

00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,950
since the first film came out earlier

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,140
this year yeah and another one this week

00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,900
and another one in like four weeks time

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:11,550
so you know it's under constant change

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:14,710
of the line yeah yeah

00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:16,990
dragon by asks is the phone trying to

00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,790
woo Firefox OS developers and how much a

00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,080
Firefox OS code it can be utilized with

00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,940
the advancing phone I don't think we're

00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,550
actively going out there in saying to

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:27,400
you know firefox OS developers you know

00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:29,440
you should come over here I you know if

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,970
their mobile app developers and the

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,380
platform they were developing for has

00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,660
gone away I'm sure they'll find

00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,730
somewhere else to go they would be most

00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,310
welcome here but we're not actively

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,200
going looking for them and I don't know

00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:43,270
yet any of them with Windows app

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,220
developers all along we haven't you know

00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,220
we're not just going to start mooing its

00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,230
Tim l5 developers now we've been doing

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,080
that since the beginning in supporting

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,660
html5 as a native app you know so that's

00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,820
the first SDK release and I don't know

00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,550
if I mean some of the Firefox OS code

00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,990
might be reusable I've certainly had a

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,640
look at some of the code myself and

00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,850
there are some things that are very

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,810
Firefox OS specific that depend on

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:13,600
certain functions of Firefox OS itself

00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:15,760
so you know there may be parts that

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,420
could be reused or you know parts that

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,570
could be modified or ported but I don't

00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,090
knowledge how much work yeah I don't

00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,780
think there's a lot of Firefox OS itself

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:31,360
that's going to be portable Tim ubuntu

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,250
right all right dragon by desk and a

00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:38,110
bunch of the mobile run on the Firefox

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:42,820
phones um maybe some of the higher end

00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:45,400
ones yeah probably not the lion is

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:49,440
certainly not the little dinky the first

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:52,540
ones the ZTE open and there and I have a

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,180
Firefox flame here which is the

00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,830
developer phone that they released a

00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,440
little while ago and I think this is

00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:03,220
even a bit too low spec for a bun too so

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,950
probably not it might be an interesting

00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:13,000
technical challenge for someone to do

00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:15,400
that good luck all right sponges does

00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,150
canonical / a bun to have a problem with

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,900
participation

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,730
as a rule yeah we've got the same

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,619
problem that every open source project

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,970
has in that we always want more

00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:32,420
participation than we have yeah that's

00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:37,869
man I Chloe wolf girl asks have you got

00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:41,180
your Christmas shopping done mostly uh

00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:43,339
you know I I personally I'm not a big

00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,750
shopper at Christmas time you know

00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:47,930
there's one person in my life that I

00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,240
really need to buy something for and two

00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,619
little people who imagine I was going to

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,799
say haven't how many kids do you have

00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,990
again well you know I I'm responsible

00:45:54,799 --> 00:46:00,049
for making sure my wife get something

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:02,029
and she is mostly responsible for making

00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:07,789
sure that father Christmas brings

00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:11,599
something for little ones you see so in

00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:15,470
sponges with a secret sponges asking who

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,240
does Secret Santa here um I don't I will

00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:20,920
let it everybody on IRC to talk to

00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:24,890
sponge about that though I am we did

00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:30,710
sponges in the in the London office one

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:32,000
year and I got a mug that has choc so

00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,500
you can write on the out so you can

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,819
scribble on the outside of your mug so

00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,010
you can tell people what mood you're in

00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:40,279
that day just by drawing a face or

00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:45,559
writing on the inside of ugly that's

00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:48,470
pretty cool a sponge also asks why are

00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:52,339
low tone bagpipes playing on my audio

00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:56,990
and I have no idea why that is you know

00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:58,490
it might be that HCA honest and sponges

00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,760
let me know that's better sometimes I

00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:05,690
get our feirense from is it yeah it was

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,910
it was kind of drunk yeah whatever i'm

00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,770
good i'm like recording a podcast or

00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:15,920
something i have to unplug it yet it

00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:19,880
gives me three hours on a hangout okay

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,920
what's next mini ducks asks what are the

00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,819
most interesting new apps or games on a

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,819
bunt new phone

00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:32,010
who i just downloaded a new game to that

00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:38,460
was really addictive let me remember

00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:40,680
what that was ask you question oh yeah

00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:45,830
I'm tool basically everything or nothing

00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:48,680
 so you know it's exciting is the

00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:52,440
document viewer with LibreOffice support

00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:55,890
that's not a game now well they said

00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,560
apps or games oh okay absolutely okay

00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:01,530
well in that case a night clock I quite

00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:05,190
like nightclub because I often like to

00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:07,650
have a clock on a device that's just sat

00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,900
next to their next to the bed or next to

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,880
my desk or something and it's a nice

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,460
little app it shows looks like an LED

00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,000
display so I quite like that and there's

00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:24,900
been recent updates to pod bird as well

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,960
oh and also um there's a port of

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,110
baldur's gate the old game from a long

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,750
time ago which was ported across

00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:36,120
children too and I had to dig out my

00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,310
copy of baldur's gate and copy it onto

00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,390
my phone in order to be able to play it

00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:46,260
which was cool said yes so the the game

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:50,400
i just downloaded um it's called hit the

00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,920
name of it uh-huh wipeout I'll swipe out

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,930
and it's the the classic swipe the

00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,450
blocks out of the way and they've got a

00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,590
whole bunch of levels on there yeah so

00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,260
that yeah that's my new addiction

00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:03,720
because I've already played every level

00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:07,230
of monster Wars and machines versus

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:11,480
machines is that petals which is ported

00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:15,480
from I think it was a sailfish yes yes

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:19,650
which is written in qml and was easily

00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,810
ported by stone flood and I have no idea

00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,390
how to play it looks nice don't

00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:27,180
understand it so when we were sprinting

00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,710
in London some of the desktop team were

00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,380
playing the game that was basically the

00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,110
same thing and yet it's it's hard to

00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,310
understand the rules when you first get

00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:40,270
started

00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:42,370
alright moving on rub a bus many texts

00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,790
asks how is convergence different from

00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:46,980
continuum and which one is better so I

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:51,990
really don't know that much about

00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:55,150
continuum yeah so can't answer that

00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,590
Chloe asks do you want and think about

00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,200
to phone will scale as well or better

00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:02,950
than Android for lower-priced devices in

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,160
the near future I think the fact that we

00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:08,770
still target the nexus 4 as our

00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,840
development target really gives us an

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,760
advantage there I don't know how it

00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,580
currently how Android currently runs on

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,520
that but I know android on my 2012 Nexus

00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:21,250
7 is almost unusable now with recent

00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,350
updates so I think as long as we keep

00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,090
targeting something like the Nexus 4

00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:27,220
then we're always going to work well on

00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:32,080
devices that are becoming the low-end

00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:37,390
devices now yeah i agree although i feel

00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:40,540
that the e the bqe 4.5 feels slower than

00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:42,460
the nexus floor to me so i actually i

00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,170
don't know what the relative specs of

00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,920
them i don't know if there is the GPU or

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:51,070
cpu or what but the the net the the e

00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,390
4.5 feels lower end feel so and even

00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,150
though it's probably newer than the

00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,400
nexus 4 fuels our end and i think it's

00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:01,390
good as mike's is that we target both of

00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:04,690
these devices so for example might

00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:06,610
mention the dock your app which now has

00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,920
libre office support and so there's a

00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:12,520
copy a cut-down copy of LibreOffice on

00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:16,060
this phone and i am staggered but it's

00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,210
able to spin on paper office and render

00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:21,970
a word document or a ODT file or a

00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:25,150
spreadsheet or a presentation on this

00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:28,150
tiny little you know computing device as

00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,730
testament to you know how far mobile

00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:32,650
devices have come along and the

00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,260
development work that the LibreOffice

00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:37,810
developers have done really but it's yes

00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:41,050
pretty cool i don't i don't think we can

00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:43,180
go much lower than this i think it would

00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,319
start to degrade the experience and we'd

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,569
have to do an awful lot of work

00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:51,380
optimizing things to get it on much much

00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:54,199
lower hardware and Jillian in the future

00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:57,079
you know devices become more powerful

00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:59,209
and the ones that are the most powerful

00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,699
ones today will become the least

00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:05,989
powerful ones tomorrow and you know

00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:08,299
we'll still be able to run this all

00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:14,359
right Chloe a swing can Americans by in

00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:16,459
a bun to phone or you can buy a BQ phone

00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,400
right now it's just not going to work on

00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:22,150
high-speed data over here in the US we

00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,650
are still waiting on and a u.s.

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,989
manufacturer or a partner who can ship

00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:29,749
phones that they can support in the US

00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:31,579
we don't have any news on that for the

00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:35,949
time being your best bet is to just pick

00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:35,949
up a nexus 4 and flash a bun to on it

00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:44,390
what's next super engineer is asking

00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:46,309
which one of us is going to send him in

00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,869
a bun to phone Christmas present and

00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:56,569
when will it arrive good luck with that

00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:58,249
yeah yeah I mean Khloe yes I i I've

00:52:56,569 --> 00:53:00,680
added a bunch of phones on to my

00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:04,729
Christmas list as well because while I

00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:08,329
have physical Oh them again well I have

00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:11,930
the e 4.5 I would quite like an e5 as

00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:16,519
well so you know hope Santa drops a bqe

00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:18,289
five down my chimney yeah I know you're

00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:19,910
suffering with only like six different

00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:23,209
phones right now and that that can be

00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:25,400
hard well they're not mine you know this

00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:29,150
is the only one is actually mine I'd

00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:32,509
paid for this so yeah I yeah I love my

00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:34,249
own bed all right Chloe has an

00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:36,529
interesting question what does a bun to

00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:39,979
on the phone look like and do in a

00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:43,160
year's time so at the end of 2016 what

00:53:39,979 --> 00:53:45,769
do you think it's going to be like so

00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,829
it's funny I have them a collection of

00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:50,059
screenshots add that I've been taking of

00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:52,489
the phone if whenever I take a

00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:55,489
screenshot for a bug report or in order

00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:57,469
to like share a feature or something

00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:58,540
that's new on like Twitter or Google+ or

00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,520
whatever

00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,310
keep the screenshot and I have this

00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,050
giant library of hundreds and hundreds

00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,880
of screen shots taken over the last two

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,770
years since the beginning of when i

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,820
first started saving them at the

00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:14,200
beginning of 2013 and looking at some of

00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,880
the apps i sometimes go back and look at

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,240
the big screen shots from the beginning

00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,420
of 2013 and compare them to what the

00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,370
absolute like now and it's funny because

00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,870
at the time we looked at some of those

00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:28,000
apps and thought yeah that looks good

00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:31,600
that's really awesome partly because you

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,610
know we created it but now you look back

00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,680
in it and we're idiots were awesome and

00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:38,290
the designers we look back at them and

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:42,130
think wow it looks terrible that looks

00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:45,070
really awful and so I I would say it's

00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:47,830
just going to look it better but to be

00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,390
fair every platform goes through that if

00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:52,810
you go back and you look at you know

00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:54,780
really old iOS or android screen shots

00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,860
you're gonna think they look terrible to

00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:02,350
someone out here at this point the iOS

00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:04,300
looks exactly the same as it did 3d but

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:06,010
yeah yeah that's true that's true so

00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:10,630
yeah the answer is an easy answer is you

00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:12,970
a little better um so I'll make a couple

00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:15,790
predictions I'm going to predict that

00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:18,100
the dash is going to look drastically

00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:19,450
different it may not work drastically

00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,090
different but I think we're going to

00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,460
probably see some major UI changes to

00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:28,330
that that's one area that's kind of leg

00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:30,400
behind we did some major changes on it

00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:33,790
early on like a year and a half or so

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,980
ago and I think it's due for some some

00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:37,810
big changes again my second prediction

00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,970
is that there are going to be a lot more

00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:45,550
apps I think by this time next year we

00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,400
will have at least 5,000 apps in the

00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:51,220
store probably quite a bit more than

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,570
that so that's my prediction we'll see

00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:58,960
how close I am to that in a year's time

00:55:54,570 --> 00:56:00,970
yeah i would i would say going along

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,590
with that net this time next year so the

00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:05,380
moment we've got like two two and a half

00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:08,050
thousand two thousand something apps in

00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:11,230
the store i would say by the end of next

00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:17,740
year we will significantly increase the

00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:23,260
proportion of native qml C++ and html5

00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:25,210
apps over and above plain web apps so

00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:29,140
there will be more I agree with you and

00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:30,970
there will be more native apps now to be

00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,640
fair we're making these predictions

00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:36,520
knowing that we're going to have a hand

00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,570
in making them come true so they're not

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,070
just debating to make them come true now

00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:45,220
come on this next year and say new home

00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:47,170
I I don't remember who said it but

00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:51,250
somebody said the best way to predict

00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:53,140
the future is to invent it so so now

00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,630
it's on us to make these things come

00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:59,430
true over the next 12 months cool I

00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,430
think that we're running out of time now

00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:08,650
many more questions oh let's see un has

00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,840
are there plans to have more features

00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,340
with the circle lock screen and a bun to

00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:16,600
touch or how will it evolve in the

00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:19,300
future I don't think there's going to be

00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:23,920
too much to that because it is you know

00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:24,940
ultimately just a lock screen so I don't

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,320
think we're going to throw it too many

00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,390
new features and that maybe you'll have

00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,700
some more stuff in the indicators that

00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:33,820
you can use from the lock screen but not

00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,980
in the lock screen itself I'd like to

00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:39,490
see a plug a plug-in based lock screen

00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:41,440
that allows you to have interesting in

00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:45,850
different ways to lock and unlock your

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:48,460
device the that we can you plug into and

00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:52,420
add so so for example I saw a really

00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:54,300
nice blackberry lock screen where you

00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,250
have a picture in the background and

00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,140
that you choose and over the top of that

00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:01,270
is just a grid of numbers like it looks

00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:05,590
like random numbers and to unlock the

00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:08,859
phone you swipe to move this Matt Matt's

00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,690
a grid of numbers until one of the

00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:12,609
numbers is over the top of a particular

00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,869
point in the picture but you choose

00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:15,369
which number and you choose which

00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:17,440
picture so anyone looking over your

00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:19,270
shoulder doesn't know which number

00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,550
you're moving or where you're moving it

00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,500
to it just looks like you're moving a

00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,090
number of grid around so that kind of

00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,620
like interesting

00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:30,010
different way to unlock your phone is

00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:32,140
what I would like to see on so if it

00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,180
takes 10 minutes for Alan to reply to a

00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,730
message to you it's only because he's

00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,680
trying to unlock his phone just cuz I'm

00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:43,450
trying to move another three over a

00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:45,610
cat's nose yes I'm gonna grab one more

00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:47,440
from Chloe she says earlier you talked

00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:49,780
about getting what's that via plug-in

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,790
for another app how's that app going to

00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,290
get alternative messages when you have

00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,420
that how are you going to advertise it

00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:58,900
to developers and who do you plan to go

00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:01,960
to so roughly the way this will work is

00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,580
kind of the way empathy works on a bun

00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,750
to desktop right now where you've got

00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:10,750
this one app and an API and plugins that

00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:13,210
will feed into that API contacts and

00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:15,100
messaging information and whatnot the

00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,510
problem with just using that API right

00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,840
now is that it doesn't allow for

00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:21,040
confinement so we can't have people you

00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,690
know throw their own plugins in the

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,120
store and know that you can install them

00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:27,070
and run them on your phone safely so the

00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,710
new API that we're developing for this

00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:32,440
is going to take that into account and

00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:34,410
hopefully provide a nice simple API just

00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,780
for messaging that people can plug into

00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:39,490
and then you know we'll promote that on

00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,170
the developer portal with documentation

00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:43,270
and instructions we will probably

00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:47,050
develop a fair number of them are self

00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:48,850
based on open protocols like XMPP and

00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,190
then it'll just be up to what's up and

00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,960
others to provide their own plugins for

00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,570
that and I think the end result will be

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,850
something similar to what I think iOS

00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,680
has in their messaging app where there's

00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:05,560
multiple services that all integrate

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:07,480
into the same place that will hopefully

01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,730
be fleshed out a little bit more in the

01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:16,150
coming year on and we'll be able to talk

01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:18,340
about that a little bit more all right

01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,620
and finally sponge is asking what the

01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,860
schedule is for 12 on air over Christmas

01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:25,750
and New Year's the schedule for Alan and

01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:28,890
I is to be on holiday until that first

01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:32,680
full week of January so we will be here

01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:34,930
I think David Piniella was planning on

01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,370
being here Tuesday I don't know Tuesday

01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,470
of next week I don't know if anybody

01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,990
else is so you may get

01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:44,230
next week you are almost definitely not

01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:46,180
going to get one the week after but we

01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,390
should be back like I said that first

01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:56,320
week of January so I think our first

01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:59,380
on-air would be January system alright

01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,840
what Thank You Alan and we are out of

01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,790
time now thank you everyone on IRC for

01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,000
your questions hope you all have a happy

01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:08,820
holidays and a fun and safe new year and

01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:14,099
we will see you all again in January

01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:14,099
