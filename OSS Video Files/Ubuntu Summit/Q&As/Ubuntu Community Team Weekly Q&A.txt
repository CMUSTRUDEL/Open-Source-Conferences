Hall hello Michael hello everyone hey

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:35,730
did a lot ask you a supplementary

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,399
question every time just to force you to

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,360
read unmute your microphone I should

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,030
have never told you I have that mute but

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,570
I'll go babe let's fun with that today

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,940
so we do this every week we all work for

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,320
the community team at canonical and

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,449
we're here to answer your questions

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,820
about up unto and things related to it

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,920
we generally try and avoid support

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,840
related questions because this isn't

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,340
really the best way to do that if you

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,439
have support questions then probably the

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,590
best places ask ubuntu or hash open to

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,030
you on IRC or bunch of forums or mailing

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,960
lists or anywhere other than here

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,600
basically feel free to ask your

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,600
questions if you visit that if you're

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,040
watching this on ubuntu on Eircom there

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,100
should be a box immediately below it

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,869
where you can just type in a name and

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,299
join in the the chat if you've got a

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,630
real IRC client then point it out free

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,930
node and the IRC channel is hash it 12

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,920
hyphen on hyphen air and we're all set

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,710
in there if you want to ask a question

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,780
then please prefix it with the word

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,570
question because then it will highlight

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,979
for all of us in our IRC clients so we

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,189
can more easily pick them out and not

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,220
miss them apologies if we do miss any

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,829
feel free to shout at us on IRC and

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,450
point to her he skipped my question

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,479
which is a common phrase used in IRC but

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,469
hopefully we won't miss any of them

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,390
while we're waiting for questions to

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,079
come in we we tend to have a little

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,410
update we did post an email update

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,239
that's worth that's worth reading to the

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,620
world lots of mailing lists where did

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,650

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,110
little few milling with to the phone

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,459
mailing list the community team mailing

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,640
list to the news team mailing list they

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,489
tend to include it in their open to

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,739
Booty you setter goes out on Sunday

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,709
anything or at least they finish

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,750
submissions on Sunday and then send it

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,480
to a canonical and journalist as well

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,030
cool so that's a good way why don't we

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,790
get object yes yeah sometimes you have

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,680
some tales guys who are not on the

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,019
regular bunch of mailing list because

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,730
they just do their sale stuff so always

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,160
send our update there as well so they

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,230
he's no better put what's happening make

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,720
sure it reaches far and wide yes exactly

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,170
the hippie end of the spectrum in there

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,819
the company you got to put it on our

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,280
slack channel now then right what

00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:14,390
accepting it yeah you're pretty lean

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,709
slack matter most telegram IRC email

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,010
everywhere hit every do we have a river

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:24,329
yet no ideas but i'm sure by the end of

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:26,280
this someone would have set one up okay

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,040
Mike I would have you been up to

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,780
anything super interesting I have been

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,260
working with the guy from our community

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,200
his name is Marius he is Mario grip on

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,750
IRC and he is working on a port for the

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,579
fairphone 2 of a bunch of foam which you

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,099
can see running right here it's a little

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,549
bit washed out because the screen song

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:50,370
super bright wow so he's on we're on

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,940
revision 9 of that now we've gotten most

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,590
of the Ubuntu device flashed bugs worked

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,440
out so that you could easily install it

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,959
now um not a whole lot else works other

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,669
than touch and screen and whatnot but

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,970
we're making good progress on that and

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,389
hopefully we'll have Wi-Fi working by

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,019
next week also kind of critical to have

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,690
life I really isn't it it is yes did

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,150
this away you can run the network

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,099
connection through USB through your host

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,420
I haven't tried that yet but I suppose

00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,090
that would work nice

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,720
but you're having Wi-Fi is kind of kind

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,420
of important awesome I Daniel you had

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,840

introduce new and interesting things

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,220
that we were conservative and didn't

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,830

actually Mobile World Congress is

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,580
happening and we've seen a lot of leaks

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,800
and rumors on the internet about some

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,190
new devices running ubuntu that are

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,970
going to be there so if anybody is in

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:48,010
Spain I think it's in Barcelona yeah and

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,300
you you can attend that and you have the

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,520
money to buy a ticket if you don't

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,020
already have one this is going to be

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,540
some really cool stuff going on there

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,270
definitely worth attending or just

it hmm awesome anything else we need to

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,140
talk about yeah we're trying to get

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,700
ourselves into the google summer of code

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:18,580
again i think on friday the the mission

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,630
ends so we still in the process of

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:26,470
trying to get mentors and crazy

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,750
mentoring ideas and stuff together so i

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,510
think after friday it's going to be one

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,820
or two weeks where Google people make up

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,980
their minds and yeah let's hope we're

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,820
going to get get included there yeah it

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,200
was it was really successful doing

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,030
google code in at the start of this year

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,840
had loads of people contributing to all

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,910
kinds of areas of ubuntu and you know we

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,150
had to pick we had to pick some people

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,850
who were what we considered you know

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,290
winners but i think we're that we seem

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,240
to be to try i think we were the winner

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,310
there because we got we got loads of

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,810
contributions from people so you know

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,150
it's great that these people get a

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,710
reward and they get some merchandise and

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,520
the people some of them get selected to

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,720
go on a visit to google and it was

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,090
really good really good meeting new

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,590
people as well new people getting

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,850
involved in the Avanti community and

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,580
contribution to the project really

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,770
really good so look forward to summer of

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,540
code as well with some more like

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,610
big-ticket things that people can work

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,470
on rather than like short little bugs

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,520
and

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:32,550
like real meeting stuff to get you right

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,080
because GCI was what two weeks long I

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,330
think I've met month just I don't know

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,430
okay but they're so there wasn't a whole

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,229
lot of time ah contribute yeah so that

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,180
it it's kind of a smaller version I

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:51,330
guess of what google summer of code is

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,890
right yeah no less intense though okay

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:58,500
is that everything we got anything else

00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:00,180
to talk about I think we should probably

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,890
start cracking on with the questions

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:09,930
should be yep sounds good golly lots of

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:12,420
questions uh who was good first see we

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,010
could go all the way back to sponge who

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,230
asked if Mark Shuttleworth is doing an

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,620
announcement again at the bun to online

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,080
summit um we're gonna try and get him on

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,080
again I don't know he hasn't done the

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,080
keynote the past a couple years i think

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,610
but he has had a QA where he would you

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,960
know present some stuff and maybe

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,970
announce something and then take a bunch

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,280
of questions and i'm sure that the

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,780
timing works out with his schedule that

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,320
he will be happy to come on and do that

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,660
again this time around and usually

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,230
always has something crazy and you to

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,420
announce so it's no problem like no

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,600
matter which convert goes to there's

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,550
always something to announce so yes yeah

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,960
ball likely Dziedzic statements about

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,660
what we're going to do in the next few

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:04,080
years that you know we learn about in

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:06,589
those that is a judgment thanks cool

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,000
it's all about openness and transparency

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:13,980
absolutely we find out when the world

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,740
finds out so next question i am from

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,700
sponges asking what phones and tablets

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,040
to the panel think should be included in

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,960
ub ports calm what would you like to see

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,730
done oh that's a good question think I

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,670
know what Ellen would like to see so

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,970
it's actually aren't you be ports is a

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,709
website that Marius set up the the chap

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,670
that Mike was talking about earlier he's

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,960
been doing a lot of porting work

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,180
and no I'll let you guys go first what

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,070
devices you think it should be it should

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,890
be ported to what should be included on

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,030
that site well I think fairly obviously

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,950
I would like to see the fairphone 2 port

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,260
working it's already on there but that's

00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,410
in a pretty early state so that that's

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,300
my goal is to get that one to where it's

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,300
usable for people who want to try it out

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,970
what about you don't any devices you

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:17,690
like sequel to 2 i'm quite happy because

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:20,900
mine is already supported no I ended up

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:26,150
I'm happy like the more the better right

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:28,010
yeah part of me thinks you know keep

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,570
plowing on with the ones we're doing and

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,880
you know incrementally go to the next

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,230
revision of each one like you know the

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,300
the 1 plus 1 or plus 2 and 1 plus X and

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:41,390
I think Mike thinks that I would say the

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,430
1 plus X because I have one but I know

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:47,810
one plus black for the same race and the

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:52,220
one plus one as well be the thing I I

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:56,420
would quite like to see is some of the

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,310
really like devices that have sold in

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,130
huge numbers where there are tons and

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,890
tons of tons of them out there like

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,000
Nexus devices are obvious because

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,530
there's a lot of those they sell quite

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,840
well they're quite popular and they're

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,000
usually quite nice devices but I'd like

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,530
to see some from other manufacturers it

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,930
might be a bit tricky I don't know much

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,330
about this porting log but I'd like to

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,430
see some of them that the big end the

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,650
high-end Samsung devices come of those

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,200
have got quite meaty specs nice screens

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,620
loads of bells and whistles on board and

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,420
all that kind of stuff so yeah I'd like

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,360
to see something like different devices

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,499
not the usual next

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,319
you know what I would like to see is

00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:38,999
some of these kind of convergence

00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:41,069
tablets that are out there like the

00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,139
transformer style where they're made to

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,939
be used with a keyboard or detached from

00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,129
it so that you could really you know get

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:50,579
that experience with a bun tues

00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:53,040
convergence also right I think the

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,079
problem you know a lot of these are

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,209
tricky whether it's because the device

00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,899
is locked down or it's hard to get hold

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,550
of the source code or they use a wacky

00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,829
bootloader or you know they've all got

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,899
like weirdnesses about them that make

00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,779
them hard to port and I think that's one

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,519
of the reasons why you know things like

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:13,680
the Nexus devices because they're easier

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,540
to unlock and the oneplus devices

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,100
because they were on cyanogenmod so you

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,839
know sources are available and it's a

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,519
lot easier to support them I think we

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,279
should reach for the stars there and try

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,079
some of the harder ones as well but I

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,459
think the main thing is getting more

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,459
people involved in that I think that's

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,439
one of the the tricky things is like

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:38,459
only having one or two people doing

00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:40,050
those pulses is going to hold the whole

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,550
project up for a while so I think yeah

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,550
we need more people get involved in that

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,439
all right if the next question was from

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,709
Sponge sponge sorry does the panel

00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:57,899
recommend Airbnb or be welcome or some

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,250
other side for the e-book on in germany

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:04,250
dated fizzy and SD and i personally

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,550
would totally recommend it I've done

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,879
Airbnb couch surfing a lot because a

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:15,540
it's a brilliant opportunity to you look

00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:18,329
full there and now think there's even a

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,009
couch surfing group nobody to cart

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,550
stuffing food so maybe even find

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:29,600
somebody who's local to their end and it

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:32,009
would be personal so I would sure good

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,370
I'll leave it at that because I've got

00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:38,309
no experience with this oh man they're

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:41,720
awesome well I I did a trip to a

00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:43,600
conference recently where we used Airbnb

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,720
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,399
four of us in there in one place and I

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,620
was great because yeah everyone gets

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,930
their own room you've got a nice kitchen

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,610
you can chat on the sofa it's just you

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,000
know somebody else's house basically

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,829
rather than like a sterile hotel room

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,389
you go back to at the end of the day

00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,360
it's it's quite nice Oh quite quite

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,579
enjoyed that bit me and yet some

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,860
interesting different houses rather than

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:12,100
just like you know a square box with the

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,990
toilet hanging off the side of it it's

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:21,550
basically what all hotel I've stayed at

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:24,430
that hotel yes um sponge also points out

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,430
that we can hear bagpipes on your feed

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,250
Mike yes I don't know what that's coming

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,500
from I have unplugged my AC adapter

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,529
because that sometimes introduces some

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,180
weird sounds into the audio feed so let

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,610
me know if there's a context that's the

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,130
problem i think you have no no my bad

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:50,110
bagpipes are soldered in I can't remove

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:51,730
those super okay but let me know if the

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:57,339
audio is better after unplugging I

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:59,110
sounds fine to me okay yeah cool next

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:04,860
question I'm not going to take this

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:08,649
question somebody else how often does

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,529
dijo Bach puppy and M hall chat to ISO

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:16,389
testing QA how do you talk to them over

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:19,689
there over there yeah I'm not sure what

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:23,829
that means so there's no like canonical

00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:25,420
back-channel to talk to QA really the

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:27,850
way to talk to them is going to hash a

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,009
bunt to dash quality and just start

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,730
pinging people specifically ping

00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:37,209
balloons he's the community team guy

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,029
inside QA so if you need any help

00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:43,600
getting started or have questions about

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,519
you know the the testing set up where

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,350
apps that are available he would be a

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,880
good person to go to again that's

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:55,120
balloons on IRC in

00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:00,210
but he wanted to get puppy recognized as

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:04,360
a saint I don't know I don't have any

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:07,270
contacts in in in Rome there so

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:12,250
everything that I on that subject not me

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:15,180
but there's a there's a great a guy who

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,040
does YouTube video is called cgpgrey and

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,920
one of the videos is how do you become

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,300
the Pope and all the things you have to

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,829
do in order to become the Pope in the

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,530
various steps you'd have to go through

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,910
if you wanted you to get to be a pope

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,070
and I think getting to be a saint

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,860
there's a there's a path along there

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,990
that so diddle down if you're interested

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,660
in you know becoming a saint or motor or

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,910
nominating someone else to be 1 i'd

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:43,360
recommend cgpgrey youtube channel as a

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,150
stop which it is you go to wikidot

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:54,490
Vatican org and you look for the

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:57,130
sainthood on-ramp it do more serious

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:03,370
subject yes he grabbed it off what are

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:07,300
you favorite new bunch of fun games so I

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:13,000
have been playing with some html5 games

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:18,640
on his website called code canyon and on

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,220
code canyon you can license libraries

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,520
and code from other developers so it's a

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:27,360
good way to you know pay developers for

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,490
their for their contributions and

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,070
there's a there's a lot of html5 games

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,620
on there and a lot of them are like the

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,430
the basics of a game is like one level a

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,260
few levels of a game and so I had a play

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,690
with some of those and I licensed a few

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,000
of them but quite inexpensive a few

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,550
dollars maybe here or there and the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,010
license allows you to reuse that code

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,050
it's not free software allows you to

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,040
reuse that code you know in some way and

00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:59,560
I wanted to learn about html5 you know

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,230
creating games with html5 and so I went

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,890
to cocaine and I license to fear the

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,480
games and

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,840
and I also wanted to figure out how to

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,610
wrap those games up in a click package

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,870
so that they would go in the oven to

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,820
store because I wanted to make sure that

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,100
it was possible for us to put html5

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,690
decent html5 games in the store in the

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,020
same way as like other platforms have

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,240
turns out it's really easy to do and so

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,730
I put a template on github if you find

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,520
my github account needs puppy you'll

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:31,700
find there's an html5 template and you

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,050
can use that to put together an html5

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,310
game that you already have we've

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,290
licensed from somewhere or you've

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,420
created yourself with the necessary

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,000
parts to create a click package that you

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,710
could then put those games in the store

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,360
so yeah there's a few games to install

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,860
my name on I didn't write them they're

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,670
ones that I have license from someone

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,950
else but they're quite good funk some

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,830
yeah so I don't I don't I'm kind of

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,420
talking about my own games there rather

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,210
than what are the most fun games of

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,790
other peoples but I I quite like playing

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,410
some of those stupid stupid games don't

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,410
crash is probably the most infuriating

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,750
and almost makes me want to throw the

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,940
phone out the window when I play yes so

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,490
I haven't really played any new games

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,980
since I got addicted to monster Wars and

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,440
beat all the levels on that which was

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,210
nice because I got it when it first came

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,610
out and then I beat all the levels and

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,650
like a week later there was a new set of

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,970
levels that were released then I beat

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,760
all them and then the next week there's

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,470
another new set of levels so I got to

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,120
finish the game multiple times which is

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:40,340
kind of fun yeah I quite like doing is

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,640
playing I'm more of a fan of older like

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,490
retro games so I like playing you know

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,330
old console old computer game so things

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,130
like this guy manic miner which I used

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,660
to enjoy on the Sinclair spectrum many

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,040
many years ago I'm not going to press

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,960
play on this I don't think because the

00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:04,100
sound is the music at shell will ya it

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,360
doesn't sound very good but yeah I like

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,210
playing those kind of old games and i've

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,100
been i've been playing with getting some

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,650
of those old games working on a buncha

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,290
phone and that's that's quite good fun

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,540
especially games that are sdl sdl based

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,940
or

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,580
a simple C++ things quite good fun to

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,950
get working if we may have just bored

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,950
Daniel right off this hangout yeah he

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:32,230
doesn't play games like range quick yeah

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,450
what I've found most of the games that I

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,850
play are like these simple little puzzle

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,740
games that I play at a restaurant when

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,810
we're waiting for our food so there's

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,870
some that I play would like my kids and

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,400
my wife these five letters where you're

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,260
given five letters and you've got to

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,580
find a certain number of words that you

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,670
can make with that combination of

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,450
letters and then petals is a new one

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:57,160
that's also quite fun you have to find

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,380
differences between a set of pictures of

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,450
flowers I couldn't really kind of

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,720
challenging I could not understand what

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,460
was going on there oh that once you once

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,470
you kind of understand what you're

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,410
looking for it's fun and you know you

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,080
can do multiplayer on that it's a good

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,580
way to kill you know 10 20 minutes when

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,520
you've got nothing else to do sitting in

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,710
a restaurant table like talk to the

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,540
family maybe and now who would do that

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,720
not that one you've got a phone that

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,270
exactly I think I like I said I play

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,940
with my kids so I still acknowledge that

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:40,210
they're there and my oh dear uh we're

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,580
gonna get lectures uh yes asks can you

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,790
tell us a bit about the mwc in barcelona

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,730
specifically the tablet yes I think he

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:54,310
asked us that after or right before we

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:56,170
actually talked about that ah ok so yes

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,640
there will be a tablet there you should

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:03,400
go and see it it'll be awful early yes

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,440
pink rabbit asks any plans or news on

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,330
Vulcan support um I don't know a lot

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,050
about Vulcan but I understand it was

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,900
announced released today and the Vulcan

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:17,260
the Chronos website where all the Vulcan

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,570
information is is housed is is getting

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,430
quite a beating at the moment and I

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:27,610
noticed actually steven webb posted on

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:30,250
google+ that yay Vulcan is out and mia

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,750
will support it in 1604

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:37,300
so how did 1604 really that's the post

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,660
that I read unless I ready incorrect me

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,890
yes wow that's that's surprising i would

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,810
have expected that there would be more

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,480
work to do that maybe it's close enough

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,510
to opengl that it doesn't require major

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,630
changes i'm just going to go and reread

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,510
it in case I ready yeah okay you got

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,700
exactly what he said well it's

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,380
officially out full support in the mere

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,480
display server will be landing in time

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:06,340
for inclusion in Ubuntu 1604 Wow so yeah

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,950
that's pretty cool so there's a headline

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:14,140
for anybody who wants to write something

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:18,160
about today's Q&A a link in the in the

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:20,170
IRC chat is interested okay that's as

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,270
much as I know about Vulcan is I saw

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,390
loads of people posting link and Stephen

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,470
saying that that's as much as I know

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:31,300
welcome back Daniel we stopped talking

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:36,910
about games now so okay good all

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:39,070
right or hex as thats that it is or when

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,800
will a bun to touch phones be ready for

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:47,260
short message service cell broadcast it

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,500
is a pretty important feature it is

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,750
something i have never heard of before

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,590
have either have you ever heard of this

00:24:51,750 --> 00:25:02,230
service cell broadcast stuff nope nope

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:05,410
no out of it wiki page say anything it

00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:10,120
was a thing too all right yeah I haven't

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:11,590
I haven't upgraded up yet it wouldn't

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,780
surprise me if it's something on the

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:17,230
list of one of the many many things that

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,690
need to be supported yeah yeah if it's

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,230
something like SMS it may require work

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,820
in upstream a phone 0 or one of the

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,350
other related projects that we use for

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,750
SMS mms sex and I think I can't see

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,630
anything immediately about it but I I

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:39,390
don't doubt if it's something so a lot

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,440
of the the things that we prioritize and

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:45,540
some of the things that we prioritize

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,540
are partly prioritized by

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,409
the manufacturers of the devices that

00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:52,570
are things that are needed for the

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:54,610
factory for example to enable them to be

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,340
able to flash the device so there might

00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,980
be things that exist on Android that

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,809
don't exist on our a bunting phone that

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,640
we need to implement so that they can

00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,950
flash the phone and similarly there may

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,159
be features that they're carriers that

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,870
we're talking to want implemented and

00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,279
that could well be on the list but it

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,500
may well be you know further down the

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,059
list them than some other super vitally

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,149
important things that they need

00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:21,429
implementing so you know that we have a

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:22,960
lot of stakeholders in a bunting phone

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:27,630
yeah there's there's you the customer

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,730
there's the the enthusiast the developer

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,080
and the people who are doing the design

00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,120
of the phone and then there's our

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,490
partners and the manufacturers and the

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,289
ODMs in the OEMs and yeah so there's a

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,029
lot of there's a lot of requirements

00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,159
coming into this and the product

00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:45,450
managers have to slice and dice those

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,679
requirements and and prioritize them so

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,610
short answer is don't know but I'm sure

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,810
it's on the list somewhere

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,420
yeah if it's an important feature I'm

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:59,520
sure one of our carriers in our advisory

00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:02,610
group will have told us that by now all

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,610
right guest asks what is the feature of

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,950
a bun to desktop after convergence by a

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,660
bun to personal in a bun to touch so I

00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,390
think he's asking what what's going to

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,650
happen with what are our future plans

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:21,450
after convergence happens well we've

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:23,910
dominated the world that's it yeah

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:27,960
that's a good question does it mean that

00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:30,690
it what's the future of like the Debian

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,070
desktop the standard desktop is that the

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,330
questions being asked I'm not quite sure

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,310
I don't know I kind of get the

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,640
impression it was you know what are we

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:40,020
gonna do next once we finished all that

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,690
what's the next big thing after

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:47,550
convergence well that's going to come

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:52,920
with convergence we're going to have to

00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:55,830
we're going to have snappy for that we'd

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,650
is going to be if it's about the work

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,960
that's going to happen after this is all

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:04,470
landed and people are using it it's

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,390
going to be quite a bit of read learning

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:11,310
and and and changing things like

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:13,800
integrating stuff into the into the file

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,380
manager or making sure that other apps

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,530
we used to do to have on the desktop

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,590
work with what we're doing now there's

00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,600
going to be it's going to be interesting

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,480
it's also going to be interesting to see

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,520
how people make use of the feature that

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,800
they can run the same code on the on the

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,700
phone on the tablet on the on the laptop

00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,620
and what people do with it it's also a

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,380
long way off really you know I mean it's

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,670
just around the corner and you can you

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,300
know you can try these things now out

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:48,600
now but it being finished is some some

00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,160
way off you know I would people keep I I

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,670
saw a news article earlier on today

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,350
where someone was saying about how 1604

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,150
is where you know convergence is all

00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,230
going to be done and me r is going to be

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:03,700
there and unity eights default

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,470
Wow no it isn't as like we're not we're

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,970
not finished with it it's it's still

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,260
it's still got a long way to go so I

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,360
think you know we're talking making

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,309
predictions about what the state of play

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,790
is going to be like in two years time or

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:19,990
more and I think I I'm not clever enough

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,540
to predict what's going to be happening

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,790
in two years time yeah I mean if you

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:28,120
think back to like when unity first came

00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,640
out you know they were there were years

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,000
between the first release of unity as

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,160
the default desktop and when unity 8

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,650
started so there there's you know a

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,809
pretty good span of time between when we

00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,370
actually land convergence and when we're

00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:44,500
going to be ready to do the next thing

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:48,460
after convergence there's going to be a

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,250
lot of time fixing bugs fine-tuning the

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,510
user experience and in that time

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,070
something's going to come up that's

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,540
going to tell us okay this is what the

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,020
next big thing is going to be this is

00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,460
where we should focus our attention but

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,059
it's too early to know that just yet

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,980
okay I should move on to the next

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,750
question pink rabbit ask any news on the

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,669
state of the app ecosystem how many new

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,530
apps number of downloads etc whatever

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:17,559
stance you have um I don't think I I

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:21,549
don't have like direct access to you

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:25,240
know how many apps I can I can what

00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,830
anyone can use the store API and query

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,040
how many apps there are in the cliq

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:32,320
store and it's it's not it's

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,660
proportionally not as big as the number

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,280
of apps that there are in like say for

00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,830
example the Ubuntu repository or the

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:44,200
Debian repository it's a kind of subset

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:47,290
of that and I I think it's growing but

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,630
possibly not a knot at the you know epic

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:52,030
kind of rate that some app stores have

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,610
done in the past so I think we've got

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,049
some work to do there to increase the

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,200
number of apps in the store and improve

00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:00,460
our experience for developers to make it

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,919
easier for them to bring apps to the

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,580
store and I think moving snappy might

00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,080
help that because it will remove some of

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,280
the barriers things like packaging at

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,100
all but people still need to develop

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,869
their apps and you know create them or

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,549
poor

00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:17,289
right I think also the big thing with

00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:20,110
snappy is that it's going to open up the

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:22,059
desktop and all of our desktop users to

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,879
these app developers because right now

00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:26,529
if you're writing an app for the phone

00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:29,950
you're looking at targeting you know

00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:32,019
thousands of users whereas if it's

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,240
available on the desktop suddenly you're

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,409
targeting millions of users so I think

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,899
that's really going to make it a much

00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:40,899
more enticing proposition for people

00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:42,850
once we have that landed and having

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:46,179
things like in-app purchase that that

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,639
we'd never had in in the desktop store

00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:51,220
yeah being able to say you know here's

00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:52,840
here's my app and if you you know pay a

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,690
little bit of money you unlock some

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,299
levels of a game or you unlock you know

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,610
some feature of application or you just

00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,799
unlock giving the developer some money

00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,929
you know in order to you know reward

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,470
them for the for the fine work they've

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:11,440
done that kind of stuff may you may help

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,480
that ecosystem one one thing that I have

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,659
seen is a couple of developers have

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,820
mentioned when they update a nap in the

00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:21,100
cliq store some of them get you know

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,830
thousands of people over a period of

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,899
maybe a couple of weeks thousands of

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,749
people update the app in there on their

00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:30,909
devices so it's not like you know

00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:32,769
there's there's nobody using the phone

00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:34,419
because thousands of people are updating

00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:36,399
to the latest version of whatever app

00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,710
that is and that's encouraging to see

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,809
it's not millions of course because we

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,039
haven't sold millions and millions of

00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:47,610
phones so yeah we'll have to wait and

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,610
see I think

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,270
next question is from pink rabbit asking

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,860
will the current phones the bqe 4.5 e5

00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:00,920
and the maze yo mix will be upgraded to

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:03,660
1604 uh yes that is the plan I believe

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,930
yes you should happen I know they're

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:10,260
doing test builds you can already flash

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:12,420
them with with Z niall which is what

00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,420
will become 1604 so there are already

00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,030
images for 1604 for those devices and

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:23,190
the Nexus devices as well that's being

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:25,140
tested now yes well yes and we know some

00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,700
of the issues that are in them so we

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,380
don't recommend people use them unless

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,720
they're like a developer working at

00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,640
canonical or a developer who wants to

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,650
work on some of those components to make

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,740
them work so yeah it's yes is the short

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,470
answer they will they will go to 1604

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,090
but not yet because it's broken I would

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,980
expect that to happen probably sometime

00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:57,210
after 1604 is actually released right

00:33:48,980 --> 00:34:00,030
exactly next question from Fabian do you

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,850
think there'll be a devices with vanilla

00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:06,960
12 on them like without much vendor

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:10,200
modification hmm good question it's

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,429
already the case that he can take your

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,990
eq phone and which quite vanilla

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:20,640
experience on to it without the end

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:24,270
additional scopes and additional apps

00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,909
and the stuff that is in there oh right

00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,440
I think he's asking did there's some

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,360
android phones that came out that were

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,710
labeled is like Google Play edition or

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,340
something like that where it was just

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,720
strictly what Google provided I don't

00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,030
think that's really I don't think

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,220
there's any real appeal to that with a

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,380
bun too because you know the

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,490
customizations on top of a bunt too are

00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,080
not a fork of what we provide they're

00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,630
just additional pre installed packages

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,310
so you know if his phone ships with some

00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,380
apps or scopes that you don't like it's

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,020
easy enough to get rid of them but

00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,550
you're you know the desk the the unity

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,450
shell is always going to be the same the

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,010
way it works under the

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,030
it's always going to be the same so I

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,420
don't think there's going to be much

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:08,430
demand for a vanilla a bun to

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,320
pre-install experience just because the

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,250
vendor modifications aren't really

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,050
obtrusive right I agree with you but

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,510
there's always someone out there who

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,550
wants to say you know what I don't want

00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,800
those things and I and I would like to

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,990
have a vanilla experience and I as I

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,520
understand it you can look like you say

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,109
you know remove all those things that

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,500
you don't want even if they're quite

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:33,420
minor and just apps and yeah although so

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,240
far most of the customization has been

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,490
around scopes related to the local

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,200
market that the phones are on sale on so

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,290
like when we released in india there is

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,910
a bunch of scopes for news sites and

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:52,950
stores and stuff in india right but

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:55,050
that's you're using a the amount of data

00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:58,560
we have is based off of three devices

00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:02,310
you know in you know once once we have

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,800
you know 10 20 100 devices across a

00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,750
bunch of carriers you know we'll have to

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,339
look at that again and I'll come about

00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,920
come back and ask us that question again

00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:12,839
and see what the differentiation is

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,310
between you know device in this region

00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,900
of device in that region device from

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,940
this manufacturing advice from that

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,349
manufacturer but I still think you know

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,569
the vanilla images should still be

00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:28,349
available yeah it's it's interesting I

00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:31,650
think if you would have just what's on

00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:34,680
your disk no matter if it is a desktop a

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:38,420
laptop or phone and it would be hard to

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,430
figure out what are the differences with

00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:44,480
ubuntu on laptop with debian packaging

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,700
it got a lot easier because you know

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,060
which file belongs to which package

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,950
which md5sum it has so it becomes a lot

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:57,960
easier to figure out what are the

00:36:52,950 --> 00:37:00,890
differences and with with the phone and

00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,450
having channels and revisions and

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:07,200
additional click packages it got even

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:10,079
easier and with the new snappy it's

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,050
going to be even easier because you're

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,800
going to have 100's snap-on Colonel snap

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,090
and they

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,970
going to be mounted like squash FS on on

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,130
your on your system so nobody will be

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,990
able to make any changes to that so

00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,960
you're going to have a bunch of snaps

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:32,550
and md5 sums and you know what's in

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,370
there so I think it would be even more

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,680
transparent and clearer what is part of

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,600
the default installer and what is added

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,640
on top of that right and i think that's

00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,650
that's a huge success of think that's

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,150
great it's not like the bad old days of

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,920
your windows directory that contain a

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,400
load of dll z and no any where they came

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,200
from and back come on whereas yeah i

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,460
mean i've been playing with the snappy

00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,890
today on my my raspberry pi and you know

00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:02,820
being able to say you know snap install

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:05,970
a snappy package and then typing mount

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,350
and seeing the directory name you know

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,520
mounted and i could just go into that

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,710
directory I'm but there are all the

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,990
files that came only from that snappy

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,670
package isn't nothing else in there it's

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,860
just that and if I unmount it it's gone

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,440
yeah if I remove it all of that stuff is

00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,420
just gone away you know it's it is nice

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,330
to have that control and say I know

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,240
exactly where that came from and it's

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,100
gone it's nice if we're going to look

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,190
back and everything else is going to be

00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:36,990
the Middle Ages basically one day we'll

00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,140
sit around telling our grandkids how we

00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:45,150
used to wait for manual app reviews in

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:48,920
the store uphill both ways happy days

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,200
why it may be nice you move on yep

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,800
sponge asks when can we get the uber car

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,950
snappy app ah ah scuba I would say so

00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,750
there's there's actually an app in the

00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,050
store right now it's using the mobile

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:06,180
web version of uber which is kind of a

00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,920
legacy fallback that they provide for

00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,670
old iPhones but you can get it to work

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,680
I've got it online I've actually used it

00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,690
when we went out to booboo khan and

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,690
pasadena to get a ride from the airport

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,550
to the hotel it works it's it's not as

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:25,130
good as a native app would be but you

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,130
know it's there it's available awesome

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,290
next question pink rabbit on what phone

00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:35,119
does have been to touch work best he's

00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:42,270
asking me to be q1 plus Nexus etc who

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:43,920
asked you a question so Alan would be

00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:49,020
the one to answer that since he's got

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,030
just about Ramon I will say the nexus 4

00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,930
worked really well with everything

00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:57,510
except GPS the GPS is not reliable on

00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,210
the Nexus 4 but I've heard that it is

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,619
perfectly reliable on the BQ and the

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,720
meizu so it's hardware thing I suppose

00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:08,700
yeah it's true I guess it depends what

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,220
you want so you know what does it work

00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,369
best well you know do you want to plug a

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,960
cable in and connect it to a display if

00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:17,970
the answer is yes then the one it works

00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,240
best on right now is the nexus 4 in the

00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:25,160
Nexus 7 ok if you want something that

00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,150
has a higher resolution display and

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,710
you're not too fussed about having

00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,630
multiple Sims than their makes for is

00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:33,750
probably the better one if you're really

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,040
really want multiple sim cards and you

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,130
really really really want an SD card

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,680
then the BQ devices so it really depends

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,900
on your requirement if if raw compute

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,349
power and screen updates are the thing

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:51,480
you really want then I'm looking towards

00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:54,240
the oneplus one just because it feels

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,400
faster than the others it feels faster

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,170
than than the nexus the BQ and they're

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,700
an amazing but unfortunately it's not

00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,710
fully supported yet and it's a community

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,780
build so you know I don't know when that

00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:08,490
the oneplus one will be fully supported

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,260
a community build but I can you can go

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,839
to you be ports to get updates on that

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,930
one and also to throw a little bit of

00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:21,740
money to Marius who is working on these

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:24,359
sports mm hole in his spare time yes so

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,609
next question what is the state of

00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,990
discourse it's been muted that it may

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:33,329
well shut down sad smiley face so George

00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:37,079
brought this up in I think tebow to

00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:39,059
community team mailing list you know we

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,110
set up discourse thinking that it would

00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,260
become the new

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,880
forums and everybody would migrate over

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,120
to it and that really hasn't worked out

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,330
so he's floated the idea now of do we

00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,030
keep trying to push this course or do we

00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:56,460
shut it down and just remain focused on

00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,900
the vbulletin forms that we have there's

00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,580
been quite a bit of discussion going on

00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,520
around that if you're interested in

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,590
joining that conversation that would be

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,330
the place to do it no decisions have

00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,010
been made yet is that conversation

00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:11,340
happening on this course or somewhere

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,630
else I know it's happening on the

00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,460
mailing list i don't know if it's on

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,720
discourse because i don't go on

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,940
discourse yeah it's one of those

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,760
experiments we try out and you know

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,280
periodically we review stuff like we

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,680
have your team to create mailing lists

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,510
and it turns out after a couple of years

00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,800
that maybe this is no longer needed or

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,830
people don't use it so we shut it down

00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,400
or you know IRC training never hear the

00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:40,440
end of it right Evan or IRC channels

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,790
that we shut down and redirect somewhere

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,350
else because they just don't need it

00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,910
anymore and there's only like two people

00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,460
idly in there or something like that so

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,860
it does make sense rather than having to

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,080
have lots of people moderating all these

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,180
different places and you know making

00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,800
sure that they're not exploited and

00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,980
maintaining them and all that kind of

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,650
stuff so yeah if this course isn't being

00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,650
used then yeah maybe we should shut down

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,760
Leigh lucky 128 asks when will it fix

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:15,360
for the mere cast technology be released

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,700
for current ubuntu phones I think that's

00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,790
probably a question for the mere guys I

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,940
think right so what I've been told is

00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:27,690
not to expect anything until after mwc

00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:31,650
so for mwc they're focused on a specific

00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:35,070
phone TV combination and making that

00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:38,250
work well for the demos and then there

00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:41,280
they will go and fix other phones and

00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:46,710
tvs after that but until then I wouldn't

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,350
expect any update right this is the mwc

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,560
don't breathe near it works kind of demo

00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:53,400
Zoe yeah

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,190
yes and you know the whole the whole

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,440
ether cast stuff is really only what

00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,330
like a couple months old they've been

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,410
working on that so it's all very very

00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:07,810
new very unstable at the moment right oh

00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,310
I so so I've tried it I did there's a

00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:12,160
command line tool right now we're it'll

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:16,840
list like your local the TVs and stuff

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,870
and I had to buy a new refrigerator last

00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,280
week which is loads of fun by the way

00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,570
but I was in the appliance store sitting

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,280
down waiting for them to finish getting

00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,050
the paperwork together and I said hey

00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,970
you know what there's an entire TV

00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,130
department over there I wonder if any of

00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,170
them are broadcasting rear cast support

00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,940
so I pulled up the command line thing on

00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:38,010
my phone and tell it to scan and it's

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,480
got like 200 TVs that are listed there

00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:43,060
did you successfully connect to any of

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,590
them no I have not I have not been able

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,810
to successfully connect to either of

00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,730
mine either oh what a shame what a shame

00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,190
I look forward to terminal you see

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,810
though when we can go into TV stores

00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,400
around the world and bring up a terminal

00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,680
on table mode TV screen and freak out

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,710
the people in the shops yes we'll have

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,010
to get that Hollywood programs that I

00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:08,440
think Dustin Kirkland made that's uh

00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,790
like team ox and a bunch of command line

00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,700
stuff that just looks like a hacker

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,190
scream just stir them up on some TVs of

00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,170
the best buy the only thing you want to

00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,940
show them is your off time anyway right

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:27,250
right yes and this is how everybody got

00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:30,910
banned from bestbuy diddle dan asks a

00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,530
new question is there any cross-platform

00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,050
story for apps development where a

00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,490
single code base can target a bun to and

00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,040
the more mainstream systems

00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,040
simultaneously I'm assuming the answer

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,360
here is called over

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,600
well really with any app there's going

00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,480
to be some platform specific things like

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,490
whatever it is unless it's like the most

00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,490
basic of basic apps like if you look at

00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,890
something like never bull for example

00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:02,640
that's in the Ubuntu app store is C++

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,600
sdl to game and it runs on lots of

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,870
different platforms but there are

00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,370
platform specific tweaks in the code

00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,540
yeah they may be minimal for some for

00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,880
some platforms so there may be minimal

00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,610
difference between one or another but

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,060
yes could over is one way to do that

00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,060
certainly one option

00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:26,090
next question also from deals and

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,740
related to the web will call / packaged

00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,140
apps be usable on the desktop in the

00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,870
future that's a good question you know

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,820
should be to see one that would I mean

00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,550
they're using the same web container

00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,380
that the browser uses and that's

00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:44,360
available on the desktop right now so

00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:47,840
and at some stage the web team changed

00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,440
it so that if you use khadora its they

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:57,800
are shipped with the app so which it

00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:02,000
would make it work Go button yeah sorry

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:04,610
gone RS Minos asked can able to touch

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,480
interact with Bluetooth printers if not

00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:11,030
when will the support for that come it's

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,190
in the works right um I don't know I

00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,320
know printing in general is in the works

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,180
so there's no know what there's been

00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,720
discussions about getting cups to work

00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,640
and having it run under confinement so

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,170
that you can you know put printer

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:29,000
drivers in there without worrying about

00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,350
them doing bad things to your phone yeah

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,310
I think some of the work was done by the

00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:36,050
desktop team by till operant a guy and I

00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,880
don't know I think it's now with the

00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,980
platform guys to integrate that that

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,750
printing work with the phone but that's

00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,240
not been done yet it's like one of the

00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,980
things on the big list yeah and all of

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,860
that would be a prerequisite to having

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,600
Bluetooth printer support I've actually

00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,380
never seen a Bluetooth printer I've seen

00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,940
y5 printers but not bluetooth hmm yeah

00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:01,400
Ritchie seems like it would be

00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:03,099
incredibly slow for printing then I not

00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,720
using them sponge asks

00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:06,940
other chances of getting birdie don't

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,329
you twitter client has a snappy app

00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:14,440
Nathan Dyer is looking for help so yeah

00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:19,869
birdie is a pretty Twitter client but I

00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:22,630
think it's mainly for LMAO elementary

00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:26,769
right right so probably depends on a

00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:28,690
bunch of stuff like the newest gtk stuff

00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:30,700
that we may not have in the archive so

00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:34,660
that would be a fun one to try and

00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:40,739
package certainly what do you say Daniel

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:45,039
packaging gtk3 apps in snappy um why not

00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:48,940
excellent good answer next question from

00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,319
hey lucky 128 when languages for a

00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,940
buncha touch keyboard will be completed

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,160
I can't write in Persian and that's my

00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,880
primary language who dear I thought we

00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,410
had most of the languages cupboard yeah

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,900
i thought we specifically had persian

00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,609
actually I remember somebody

00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,849
contributing I think a purging keyboard

00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:09,549
layout to us so I know the main guy who

00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:12,660
works on the keyboard Mike Sheldon has

00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:17,549
also been working on some other projects

00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:19,779
within a buncha touch and I know he

00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:20,979
didn't have a lot of time to work on the

00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:23,979
keyboard so it could well be that

00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:26,920
there's contributions that have emerged

00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:33,009
yet or haven't been landed in in the

00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:34,630
phone yet I I don't know I looks like

00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:38,739
Daniel is looking up version on his

00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:40,239
phone ya can't find it we had I think

00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:42,339
there is a wiki page or something

00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:45,609
detailing how to contribute a keyboard

00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:50,739
layout Mike Sheldon would be the person

00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:56,670
to to ask about that I know the keyboard

00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:59,170
did change quite a bit in the latest and

00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:04,559
what's the two little carriage code for

00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:07,329
persian lignite pardon us it fast eight

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,860
no I don't see it on my phone so that

00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:14,520
also conflict everybody

00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:17,040
all that's right down the bottom it says

00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,920
because alou is hiep this heap Ukraine

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,920
Hebrew Arabic and then Chinese right at

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,260
the bottom maybe I'm missing some i'm on

00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:31,890
a parsley proposed and they're right

00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:33,450
down the bottom ah ok so sorry that your

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:39,090
keyboard layout isn't isn't available

00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:41,430
but we can ping Elliot ll here on IRC

00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:44,250
like Sheldon if you want to ping him

00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:51,110
maybe he'll let you know the status of

00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:51,110
that sorry about that person friends yes

00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:57,320
question from Sponge have any of the

00:50:54,990 --> 00:51:02,300
panel ever used a new Libra principally

00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,300
operating system triskele blag nuisance

00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:09,180
personally no talk now and they didn't

00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:12,600
work so I threw them away how big are

00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:15,960
the differences like if you chose to use

00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:20,520
liquid and install option just use free

00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:24,590
drivers free everything and I thought

00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:27,180
that was pretty close to the new bun to

00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,890
write like that's pretty close it's

00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,470
still there you know if you if you boot

00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:34,020
the live seen alive ability CD I think

00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:35,400
you press f4 there's a little menu down

00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,080
the bottom of screen or f5 one of those

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,180
there's little menu this is free

00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,000
software only yeah and that will get you

00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,340
your bungee desktop without the nvidia

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,260
driver and without flash and all the

00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:49,710
naughty like firmwares and all that cast

00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,330
up yep um but it sure doesn't include

00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,010
firmware I thought maybe that was the

00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,050
differences that it included some of the

00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,150
colonel something firmware than the

00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,790
colonel includes a free software only

00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:03,270
one doesn't that's ok different doesn't

00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:05,070
but but even then I think spending a lot

00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:07,950
of time getting that working is a hiding

00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:09,570
to nothing because you know if the goal

00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:12,390
is to get free software foundation

00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:15,270
approval for your distro we will not get

00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,190
that just by making the ICM each free

00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,500
software because there are other things

00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:21,660
they would require of us like not making

00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,110
it easy to install non-free JavaScript

00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,960
or not easy to install

00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:30,020
non-free plugins and add-ons and not

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,480
having multiverse easily accessible and

00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,660
things like that so I think it's a slope

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,150
and you know we're way way back and i

00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,460
don't think i think the other distros

00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,590
like triskele new sense and others

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,180
service that requirement from the people

00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,980
who really want that and from the Free

00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,200
Software Foundation who want to be able

00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,150
to say here is a distro that we approve

00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,860
of I don't think we'll ever get that

00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,620
because of the pragmatic approach we

00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:57,320
have two things like firmware huggins

00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:00,200
they're loading software use a choice

00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,850
and so on yeah and I think I don't think

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,410
we need that because there are these

00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,180
districts out there that already focus

00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:09,320
on that right and some of the bill on

00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:12,650
Ubuntu which is great you know yep okay

00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:15,740
running out of time here hey lakay asks

00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,810
and apparently there's an aquarius m10

00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,640
tablet as a mid-range device can be

00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,400
useful and usable for future ubuntu

00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,620
touch major updates I think that the

00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,600
implication there is if i buy a device

00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,970
now will it always carry on working will

00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,790
I always get the updates in the future i

00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:35,120
think is the implication from that if

00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:37,520
you buy the bunt to addition of it then

00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,110
you will get updates from us as long as

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,820
we can possibly provide updates to it

00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:46,550
don't buy the android version of that

00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:48,380
tablet and assume that it's going to

00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:54,980
just work with a bunt to updates because

00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:58,700
we can't guarantee that okay another

00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:01,100
question from a li a 128 don't you guess

00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,790
perhaps have imported troubling to touch

00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:08,510
or will they run natively so you may

00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:11,270
have seen in some of the the promotional

00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:13,250
material screenshots and pictures of

00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:18,080
icons showing some traditional x

00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:20,510
applications like x chat gnome firefox

00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,970
libre office and there's another 1i

00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:26,780
coverage 'edit i think it is yes um

00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:29,830
those are native in terms of their

00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:34,430
running on the arm cpu inside the phone

00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:37,819
they're running under ex-mayor under mia

00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:41,449
so you're you're you're running at reg

00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:46,660
tional legacy X application through me

00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:49,099
on a phone so yeah they're their native

00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,569
yeah there's whatever that definition of

00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:53,479
native is that there's two different

00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:55,940
levels there's CPU native which they all

00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:59,449
will be and then there's display server

00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:01,130
native which the easy route will be to

00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:03,469
not do that and just run through ex

00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:06,709
mirror but if they're using one of the

00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:08,630
major tool kits then you know they could

00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:12,920
be ported to run directly on your

00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:14,509
instead but the one of the problems is

00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,279
many of these desktop applications don't

00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:19,999
suit very well to touch interfaces like

00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:23,029
you know running X chat on a on a thing

00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:24,920
this size or your libra full fat libre

00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:27,499
office with many bars and everything on

00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,940
a device this size isn't optimal yeah

00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:30,949
most of them are going to be terrible at

00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,509
that right and it's not to say the

00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:35,599
applet is terrible it's just that they

00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:39,859
were never designed to be run on a four

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:44,660
and a half inch screen at 960 x 540 with

00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:50,390
no keyboard it's there just weren't

00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:51,529
designed for that so yeah and next

00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:57,410
question is similar to the one we did

00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:59,239
about the other devices that support

00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:03,140
really it's the same question isn't it

00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:05,839
yep the Apple devices it's hard to say I

00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:08,119
mean we can't say because it's not hard

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:11,809
job but the goal is to continue to

00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:13,579
bother them for as long as possible all

00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:16,489
right the sponge ass instead of saying

00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:19,099
by an SSD for your laptop what would you

00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:21,349
say to use you're still using 1204 and

00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:24,829
letting them into the unity ecosystem

00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:27,019
how would you recommend unity so unity

00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:29,869
was default in 1204 so I'm not entirely

00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:33,709
sure if you're asking about somebody

00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:36,369
coming from pre unity into unity or just

00:56:33,709 --> 00:56:40,400
people who are sticking to an old LTS

00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:43,039
because they have old hardware I think

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,769
in addition to SSD you know getting more

00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,779
RAM would be a big help for anything I

00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:50,569
think one of the problems in that kind

00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,230
of era when unity was a default on tova

00:56:50,569 --> 00:56:52,670
for one of the

00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:55,640
a lot of people have was that their GPU

00:56:52,670 --> 00:57:00,109
wasn't up to it because it requires you

00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:03,380
know opengl yeah some of them felt a lag

00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:05,720
and no adding an SSD or adding more RAM

00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:08,210
probably wouldn't fix that it's it's one

00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:11,840
of the pitfalls of having a you know

00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:15,190
device with a built-in GPU building to

00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:17,930
the CPU or low-end GPU is unity just

00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,850
didn't run particularly well on it now

00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:22,520
you know on the devices you can get now

00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:27,290
the OpenGL support is great and it runs

00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:28,460
perfectly fine so yeah I don't I mean if

00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,650
your machine doesn't run unity well

00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,619
don't use unity you something else yeah

00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,150
this is no you don't have to use unity

00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:37,609
if if the machine doesn't run it well

00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:41,690
don't use it yeah and there's Marte

00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:45,550
there's xfce and lxde lots of options to

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,550
choose from still staying on a bunt ago

00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,500
nice question what partners a canonical

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,200
develop snappy apps or it is not a thing

00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:58,520
yet are you allowed to talk about that

00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:01,250
Daniel of them and we can already go to

00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,109
you able to comment / things or there's

00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:07,910
another snappy page in there in the

00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:11,300
cloud section almost everyone is looking

00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:15,470
at it I think what didn't quite play in

00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:18,560
our favor was dead from 1504 when we saw

00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:22,820
the first inclination of of snappy to

00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:24,859
1604 now lot of things changed but they

00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,960
were all made for for good decision like

00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:29,420
it made sense to make those changes but

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:35,320
I think that's going to call it a cover

00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:40,790
of a rift now and we've seen drones TVs

00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:43,100
everything with snappy so it is a thing

00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:44,840
and I think snap craft is going to

00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,670
really open up the doors to that too

00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:52,240
because it does make it so easy to build

00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:56,470
snaps from existing projects yeah I

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:59,390
think there was a last question of today

00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:01,940
yes we're pretty much out of time yeah

00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:03,880
thank you everyone few questions it's

00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,269
been really lots of good questions

00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,619
and Vietnam most got to them all if we

00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:10,359
missed your question and you still

00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:12,400
really want your answer to it you can

00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:15,130
join any of our various IRC channels

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,069
hash a bun tube desktop hash you want to

00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,599
touch hasha bunt to quality all of these

00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:23,559
have hyphens in the middle by the way I

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:29,250
didn't mention those or you know find us

00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:33,700

00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:37,769
diaspora then that's still around I

00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:40,119
thought that went the way of identica

00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:41,920
now I'm getting it I'm going to get

00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:44,920
angry messages from people who still use

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,140
identica it's it's me software you can

00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,180
make yourself so people still run it

00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:54,369
they can ascend you angry letters on

00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:58,109
identica yes perceptions okay right and

00:59:54,369 --> 01:00:02,009
and make sure you a circle friend follow

00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:05,109
