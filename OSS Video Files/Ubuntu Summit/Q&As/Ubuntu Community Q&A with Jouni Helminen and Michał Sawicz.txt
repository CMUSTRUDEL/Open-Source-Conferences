you but today we have somebody from the

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,390

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,720
vinny 218 so if you have questions there

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,340
we're going to get them answer today and

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,689

on-air accounts so that the youtube

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,280
account Twitter account that way you're

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,829

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:46,829
okay we have just let me know that he's

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:53,369

a few and as Mike said on on IRC if you

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,140
have questions make sure you prefix them

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,520
with question in all caps so we can more

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,310
easily pick them up if we have any

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,439
announcements this time like yes we

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,410
wanted to talk about Abu Khan Europe

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,690
which is coming up in November so this

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,740
is kind of grown out of the uba cons

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,590
that have been in

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,730
germany and in france for several years

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,260
now it's a slightly larger event that's

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,200
going to encompass people from all over

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,180
europe including some of us from outside

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,180
of europe so i'm going to be flying in

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,360
from the US I know Jose is flying in

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,220
from Peru so we're going to have a nice

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,170
global selection of speakers and

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,100
attendees at that one so that's

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,890
happening November the calendar now I

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,550
posted a link in the IRC but it is

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,030
November the 19th and the 20th or 18th

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,560
19th and 20th if you want to come for

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,200
the social event that happens on the

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,910
evening of the 18 and that's going to be

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,370
in essen germany which is in the north

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,080
western part for those who don't know

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,950
which was me not too long ago I had to

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,330
find that on a map so that's going to be

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,520
lots of fun if you've never been to a

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,670
new boo calm before they are small

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,500
conferences focused around a bun to or

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,780
topics related to a bun to we get

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,820
speakers from the community and some

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,610
from canonical who come in and give

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,040
presentations boo boo con Europe is

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,470
going to have Jane Silber the CEO of

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,810
canonical giving the keynote so that

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,010
will be Saturday morning on the 19th you

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,840
don't want to miss that yeah if you go

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,970
to calm dog there's like only a lots of

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,480
information already about about upcoming

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,110
talks so maybe some are still being

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,660
added um but there's loads and loads of

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,520
great speakers there it's going to be

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,440
it's going to be a lot of fun all right

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,510
why don't we introduce our guests and

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,660
what they do before we start taking some

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,820
questions so we'll start with you uni uh

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,050
can you tell us what team you're on and

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,870
what your kind of day to day working is

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:16,230
show so I'm in the design team visual

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:20,190
design and I've been working in the

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:23,460
phone for a few years and mostly more on

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,700
desktop and last kind of 6 to 12 months

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,470
doing the convergence stuff so I work

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,030
more on the

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,800
so I've been working on this ticket

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,290
previously but this there's more on the

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,450
upside so you might have see in the

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,060
terminal refresh we blogged about

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,580
recently and then that working system

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:49,040
settings yeah there is various things

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:52,100
the visual design Muslim so my turn I'm

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,620
sorry I am managing the team that's

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,050
behind in here today and for a long time

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,420
I was behind the unique it on the phone

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:06,050
and now we are working on it for all

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:09,290
your devices all right so obviously any

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,480
questions about apps design unity 8

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,610
desktop or mobile you can go ahead and

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,040
ask those but you can also ask us any

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,660
other questions try and keep them

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,630
related to a bun to we tend to get

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,950
questions about trees and sandwiches

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,650
which are entertaining but not

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,300
necessarily informative but we will try

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,020
and answer as many questions as we get

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,910
regardless of what they're about so once

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,010
again ask them right below the video in

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,770
the IRC channel start with the word

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,010
questions in all cap or question in all

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,870
caps that way it turns bright yellow for

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,180
me and whatever highlight color daniel

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,350
has for him and that way we don't miss

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,990
any questions all right so let's start

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,120
at the top from jam together he's asking

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,860
a bunch of made my phone not turn on

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,210
nexus 4 what do I do now um there are

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,580
various things that could cause that

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,690
most of them are Hardware related and I

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,880
think related to battery charge so I

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,330
think sometimes you need to let it power

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,320
all the way off before charging it

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,510
sometimes you have to take the battery

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,850
out and plug it in to reset something so

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,710
that it will start charging again it's

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,570
usually related to battery though when

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:26,330
it won't turn on like that or if not

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:27,740
battery but hardware not software so try

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,750
some googling and see if you can find

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:34,460
something that matches your current

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:38,090
symptoms and you can also alt right well

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,690
do you have any missed it's also nice

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,690
consequence

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,080
alright the next one from scopes

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,980
appropriately and that is how is the

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,190
free fresh scopes going so you showed

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,230
off some new designs or design proposals

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,390
for scopes at the last a bunt to online

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,590
subnet can you give us an update on

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,540
where those stand yep this is something

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,790
we've been discussing a static actually

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,610
recently we are we just started on some

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,430
of that work so we are going to make

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,770
them look a lot nicer the current

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,520
implementation with some quick wins and

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,830
that gets us some towards the new

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,890
designs so hopefully those should land

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:30,700
in the next few months I think by yeah

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,800
that the current quantum implementation

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,000
that we've got on the phone on on tablet

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,810
and unit eight will really improve

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,610
either in the near future for people who

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,380
weren't at that session can you give us

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,630
kind of an overview of what new features

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,860
or customizations are going to be in

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,080
that I don't know so much about the UX

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,140
of the new features i've seen lot more

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,460
my fifth your hang and SS filtering

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,590
mostly just individual thought I think

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,570
the quick witness will have should come

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,000
on to it quickly i think sabic you no

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,920
longer great moral religious listened

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,400
damn immediate in the immediate time

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,730
frame we're scheduling small visual

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:17,140
tweaks and updates to basically how the

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:20,260
current dash works and looks just to

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,650
make it a little bit more modern longer

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,590
term we're still working on some new

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,930
user experience questions how how does

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,900
the dash work in a window the

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,300
environment because this is so we're

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,360
targeting right now our bigger focus is

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,000
the windowed environment and it being

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,750
just a standard window just like any

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,620
other app is and isn't giving it the

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,390
attention that it deserves so this is we

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,420
are still working on it and on the

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,840
conceptual level so this will be a

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,770
longer

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,470
something after we first have a lot of

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:05,500
other features to do for convergence in

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:07,450
Egypt all right and bouncing off that

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,330
answer is the next question from rock

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:16,800
corn yes what is the state of unity 8 on

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:20,530
the desktop and laptops for x86 to go to

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,390
MH al l 119 s blog I didn't know who

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:26,710
that is but the air to Michael halls

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:29,950
blog there's a there's a there's a nice

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:34,180
workout on how to get the current status

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:36,870
of unity it's not perfect it does like

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,940
the biggest missing feature of it is

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,030
probably real window management when

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,970
you're when you're talking about menus

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,430
complex venues things like that so

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,290
actually being able to for an app to

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,370
create multiple surfaces with different

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:57,250
content and for ugh to be able to to put

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,930
them together correctly we are actively

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,550
working on this right now this is our

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:09,180
immediate focus so that unity it gets

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:12,040
the gnome non window management features

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,450
from from you know that you are used to

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,300
today so i posted a link to that blog

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:23,140
post he was referring to in the IRC

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:26,710
channel and for that i was using my

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:29,170
laptop and just installing from the

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,570
stable phone overlay PPA so i got the

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,820
latest versions of unity aid and all its

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,730
dependencies and then i would just

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,270
switch to it in light DM but there's

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:44,290
also a way that you can run it in a kvm

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,880
virtual machine i'm working right now on

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,730
all the details of how to do that

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,190
properly so i can write that up and post

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:58,990
that i will try and post that on unity

00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:00,670
ubuntu com when that's ready we we

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,600
follow the blog as well as superuser we

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,890
did some USB sticks until only for the

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,610
design team and we've managed to get

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,589
going on

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,550
different different hardware so

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,959
different kind of laptops and it works I

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,560
think one big missing piece is still the

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:20,170
absolute and yes yes the availability of

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,149
apps from historic from the from the

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,130
last or Indian today so but I think that

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,950
will come together when we get snappy on

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,250
and there as well and start getting more

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:34,089
apps package with a schnapps but yeah

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,820
it's really interesting to I would write

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,560
the next question is from Nexus asking I

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,079
know unity 8 is not a great departure

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:47,709
from unity 7 but what new design

00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:50,760
innovations are you proud of um I think

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:53,050
we in terms of design we look into of

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,600
features rather I think we're looking to

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,100
get parity with unit 7 your servant such

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,110
a mature desktop environment that

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,600
there's there's a lot of work that will

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,880
go into just reaching parity but in

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,930
terms of just visual stand the way it

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,399
looks I think unit 7 is very mature but

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,130
I think it also is showing this age a

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,800
bit so i think i think is really looking

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,440
kind of next generation to it when when

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,600
we boot it into it on kind of high res

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,730
screens it looks so crisp it looks

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,990
beautiful so I'm really happy with the

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,230
based learning right in terms of visual

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,880
visuals there's still a lot of you know

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,670
wrinkles to iron out in terms of

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,500
usability apps things like that but just

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,480
visual style I think it's getting very

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,720
nice I think one of the biggest wins of

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,529
unity 8 over in g7 as like you know our

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,600
favorite word convergence but from from

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,910
the get-go we've been working on it so

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,610
that the user experience is consistent

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,070
not exactly the same but consistent

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,310
between your phone between your tablets

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,410
and a bigger device so that you can get

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,720
used to the same methods of using it

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,940
instead of you know you have these

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,880
convertible laptops and as long as

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,769
they're plugged into a keyboard then you

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,350
know you're using it as your you know

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,079
plain old desktop but as soon as you

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,760
take the keyboard away and it switches

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,520
to something completely different like

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,290
you have no to two worlds to live in and

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,509
instead what we've been trying

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,730
engage from the get-go is actually

00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,339
trying to pull those two together as

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,440
much as possible to reduce the reduce

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,329
the differences as much as possible and

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,029
I think this is the biggest win because

00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,949
we've I think the witness is coming from

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,050
the fact that we've started on the phone

00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,480
so we've kind of expanded the phone

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,040
experience into the tablet and then

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,920
expanding it again into the desktop

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,870
instead of trying to cram the desktop

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,209
experience into a film like you like

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,009
this direction is easier for us to to

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:57,069
keep to keep their consistency going

00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:59,410
it's also for for app developers it's

00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,149
just beautiful to be able to just write

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,329
an app once and it's going to work

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:07,120
across all the other form factors and

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:09,880
then not to mention that the scopes can

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,040
be written in JavaScript and loads of

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,759
new stuff like it's going to be much

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,839
much easier to create content for 4 u t8

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:23,560
and write apps like using qml is just

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,600
beautiful and easy and so saying that

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,230
you did t8 is not a great departure from

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,550
g7 is a bit of an understatement yeah I

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,920
think for anybody who wants to

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:38,829
contribute to the bun tube desktop

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,899
interface the the it's much easier to

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:44,170
get started with unity a tin with unity

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:48,100
7 I looked at contributing to unity

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,260
seven years back and as soon as I

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,360
started looking into all the compass

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,240
stuff that all just went right over my

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,060
head I had no idea what i was looking at

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,779
but when I looked at the unity 8 code

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,220
that so much of its qml it's so easy to

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,199
read and understand what's going on and

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,149
to make changes and see how they work

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,389
but Michael was Frank to say is that

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:18,880
power job it's easy now yes so no

00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:22,269
excuses get all the features it's still

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,959
a big project and you can see a lot of

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:29,410
the design decisions that that had to be

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,620
made to make it work and seem as easy as

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,620
it is

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,389
all right where were we on questions

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,860
thinking bite was asking what happened

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:48,160
to the animal themed wallpapers we only

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:54,069
had officially we only had two didn't we

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,899
that were animal theme I think the you

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:59,319
know we still draw inspiration from

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,750
sodium every time there's a new release

00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:05,880
then we have an origami artist that

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,110
makes the animal into beautiful kind of

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,540
origami and then we use some of those

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,279
folds in in the world paper so it's

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,220
taken more of an abstract turn I guess

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,459
so drawing inspiration from the actual

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,600
origami rather than an actual under a

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:21,600
picture of the animal self

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:33,080
all right a question from v-rod i'm

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,540
using the budget my personal pcs i'm an

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,330
open-source evangelist and i want to

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,110
create a good chew local team in kolkata

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,270
I know sorry there was a question and I

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,370
guess the question was if anyone wants

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,850
to create and put your local team in

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,990
kolkata so what i would recommend is

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,940
that you take a look at local.com

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,130
because they are already our local

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,730
teasing in that region that like there's

00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,290
a huge indian local team so maybe just

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,450
make sense to get in touch with them

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,390
first I could even imagine that there's

00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:12,380
loads and loads of would you use in

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:16,730
Qatar already and yeah there's no other

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:19,790
things go yeah local teams are generally

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,410
organized at the country level but for

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:25,100
something like India where you've got a

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,950
huge geographic area to cover you can

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:31,910
either just arrange subgroups within the

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:33,500
team or even create some teams just try

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:41,480
not to break it if too much because then

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:44,270
it does create fragmentation all right

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,800
scopes is asking why can't we set a

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,880
wallpaper for the background of scopes I

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,890
think that may actually be more of a

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,520
design answer than an implementation one

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:57,140
right so I know a little bit about this

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,030
I've didn't work in this directly but

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:05,960
just overhearing I think gun I think

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,840
this may change later scopes turn up to

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,340
be kind of an app where you can set the

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,630
background of your phone but maybe the

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,880
Scopes app will have the default

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,970
background I think we were just

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,350
concerned with the legibility because

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,420
there's qualitative density information

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,190
sometimes on the scopes and you know

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:27,260
people say all kinds of backgrounds and

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:28,940
and also i guess the kind of i said

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,900
legibility being the main thing but also

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,090
the the brand we were just wanted to

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,920
keep it very light let's not say that we

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,809
might we not going to let people

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,460
customize it later on but

00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,960
as a first step we just want to get

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,590
something out there is that literally

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,110
clean it's also i just wanted to add

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,090
that we are letting scope authors to

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,429
actually influence a lot of the visuals

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,009
of the scopes so if you look through and

00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:57,860
the scopes available on today in the

00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:00,350
store a lot of them will be because this

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,490
is brandy coming from the content

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,740
instead of you you creating your own

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,740
your own thing and but as you and you

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,509
said the plan for the the dash for the

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,600
new scopes infrastructure was always

00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:17,389
that you will be able to customize it in

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,659
a in a big way and one of those will

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:24,740
definitely be influencing the visual

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:26,840
looking fuel of of your own custom scope

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:33,320
if you say your page in scopes or

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:36,409
whatever alright the next one is from

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,419
rock corn what unity 7 features will be

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:43,570
the same for unity eight give examples

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,570
of virtual desktops global menu etc I

00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,519
think this can be between me and the

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:56,119
only um global menus yes we're almost

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:59,480
there global menus will be there virtual

00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,460
desktops will be different I can't

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,340
necessarily say exactly how different

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,490
they will be they will work with

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:11,720
together with multiple screens and so

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,700
there is still ongoing work but it will

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,220
definitely be a feature it might work

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,899
slightly differently and the reason for

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,549
Jats at least part of the reason for

00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,669
that is that we're going into a much

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:26,869
wider spectrum of how your setup may

00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:29,840
look like and two screens does not mean

00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,759
anymore that you have your you know 22

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,429
monitors in front of you because one of

00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:38,330
those screen will might very likely be

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:42,440
your phone that is wirelessly connected

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:46,580
to a 4k monitor and so this this makes

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:50,480
us have to think much more you know in a

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,640
you know much wider spectrum of how we

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,920
need to what we need to enable

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,570
so I can say right now what how it's

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,130
going to look like this we're still

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:04,250
ironing out the kinks but but this these

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,020
are features that will be here um other

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,700
than that you know the launcher the

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,550
launcher is actually probably one of the

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,930
most similar items between between

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:19,850
eighty seven and eight bar visuals the

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:22,280
right the spread or the switcher is

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,780
going to be different a lot of different

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,090
again bound into into work spaces and

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,970
multi monitors actually there will be no

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:35,480
separate out tabs feature but we will

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,060
have this one single UI for for

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,410
switching first fishing between screens

00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,730
between windows indicators right now how

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,070
they look they are very much

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,380
touch-centric Pat's oriented we are

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,900
working on on making them pointer

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,550
friendly so that when you actually

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,610
invoke them with a mouse they will be

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:57,470
small cultural compact as they are in 97

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,920
if you invoke them with that you will

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:05,630
get the wider wider menus so that so

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:08,840
that it's an easier touch target it's

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,180
probably difficult to say we'll have to

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,920
see 404 for a big part because we are

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:18,830
still we're still working on a lot of it

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,560
alright so one of our regular questions

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,300
that we get and our regular asker chloe

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,390
Wolfie girl is not here today so I'm

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:32,290
going to ask it for her and that is what

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:35,510
is the state of the HUD for unity 8 um

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,630
yeah there was some designs for it and

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,740
some early implementations for hard

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,460
while ago a couple years ago for the

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,900
phone but we had to kind of pry it as

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,560
other things I think is still a nice

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,420
feature hopefully we'll we'll land

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,750
immunity at some point but there hasn't

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,610
been much recent designer that so yeah

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,950
we've been kind of practice and things

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,580
to get done first and I'm sure we'll get

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,290
to the hut at some fun so that's one

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,560
feature where we're not quite gonna have

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,420
parity with unity 7 in the near term

00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:14,090
yeah I guess so i haven't seen haven't

00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:16,650
it in designs great yeah so so okay

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,560
wouldn't say in very near south el

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,570
hombre multi-monitor and the workspaces

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,240
left fighting I've seen some designs for

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,100
both so they've been on the task

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,350
switcher in the early design side seen

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,200
by still being pro side we've got one

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,880
very good prose of ours better working

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,110
on that so I've got full confidence

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,170
that's going to be a really nice place

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:43,020
but um yeah workspaces are all debt one

00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:44,880
being life done all right rock corn is

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,770
asking it's a buncha to phone design

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,260
more like Android or iOS and did to

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,930
alter that question a little bit can you

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,310
just speak to kind of what your design

00:23:53,930 --> 00:24:01,080
inspiration and influences were going

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:04,110
into designing apps and the UI sure I

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,780
think we've we've drawn the influence

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:12,540
from from every everything that's there

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,780
already and I'd say the biggest de

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,780
French

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:27,430
oh did we just lose him yeah we'll take

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,710
it yep oh there we go but yeah I'd say

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,560
that the biggest differentiator is the

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,650
convergence features because something

00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,780
that neither android/ios have androids a

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,480
little bit further than that so they're

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,220
starting to have some early kind of

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,320
window environments for Android but

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,700
still far from what you need for

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,820
productive work so yeah I mean with

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,890
we've drawn influence from both bottom

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,020
I'd say the convergence bit is the big

00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:00,580
biggest differentiator in terms of the

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:04,950
kind of inspiration for the aesthetics

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,950
that we heavily influenced by Japanese

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:14,110
Japanese art so done you know in terms

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:16,620
of like landscaping architecture visual

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,680
arts and just that sense of calmness and

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:24,250
space is a big feet big inspiration

00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,900
source of inspiration price and it's

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,260
kind of nice to sometimes draw

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,410
inspiration not from the immediate thing

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,480
that's very closely like not other types

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,430
of UI design from very similar products

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,460
but something sometimes from a little

00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:46,780
bit further field as well and the design

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,270
language is then called Sora and we've

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,720
got quite a lot on the blog about that

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:56,590
if anyone else read up more on that and

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,780
where's the blog on design doc ubuntu

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,640
com so there's that should be a couple

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,500
of blogs on the design language in

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,870
general Hulk of fun links for this

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:10,090
lesson for posting all right a dragon

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,580
bite is asking why can't we have a basic

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,510
local wallpaper changer built in rather

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,090
than have to use third-party

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,960
applications like variety or wall CH um

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,680
because you've got those third-party

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,730
options really you know they work they

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,040
work well they each have their own

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,250
different way of handling it and options

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,680
that they offer I don't really see any

00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:36,100
to us having the one built in it's not

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,480
something that everybody wants so for

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,010
the people who do want it finding a

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,470
third-party application that does

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,360
specifically what they want is probably

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:48,670
a better option than having one built in

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:51,070
that doesn't yeah I guess you have to to

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,460
draw the line somewhere just to somebody

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:56,050
else Apache will be a really important

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,140
thing and they are going to wonder why

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:03,300
is that insult by default or at them or

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:09,640
Spotify or skype or whatever else so

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:11,890
it's good that you have the options all

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,770
right scopes is asking what do you think

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:22,090
about Instagram and I am not familiar

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:24,400
with instagram as anybody here don't

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,740
know if maybe he meant Instagram but

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,510
that really wouldn't help me because I'm

00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,510
not very familiar with Instagram either

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:37,900
all right well move on nightmare is

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,960
asking has unity eight high DPI been

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:46,890
tested on 2k 4k resolutions on large

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:49,270
displays so I tested the unfixed an inch

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,290
microprose and it works really nice and

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,720
crisp we have we have a 4k screen yep

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:58,210
it's so i'll test test on that next week

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,700
but yeah every every screen we throwing

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,650
out as looked really nice so you up I'm

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,650
absolutely positive it's going to look

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,930
great fun for discounts and one of the

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:11,290
nice things that we have going for us is

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:15,550
the Ubuntu UI toolkit and its grid unit

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:17,200
approach to component sizing can you

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,410
give kind of are you familiar with the

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,310
grid units part of that yeah sure so

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:31,450
it's kind of similar to virtual pixels

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:34,840
in in android is CSS so because we have

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,450
hydrants this place one pixel can on

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,080
those can be too normal pixels or even

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,960
more so it's kind of a layer abstraction

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,220
on top of that so we

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:52,720
we have this unit score grid units which

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:55,330
are eight DPS lodge and with those is

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,430
kind of nice to lay things out because

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,660
that you can do things like alignment

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:04,180
much easier but yeah is a layer of

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:08,380
abstraction top of lesser DPS or which I

00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,390
used on Android but it does make make it

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,970
easier to scale to different screen

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,370
densities with Isis it also gives us the

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,530
ability to scale it depending on like

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,020
viewing distance to right so if you want

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,370
to have different values for a TV on the

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,040
other side of the room as opposed to the

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,440
screen in your hand yeah yeah absolutely

00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,300
on we're working on a setting for system

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,010
settings at the way my way we will have

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,950
a slicer at the moment it's a little bit

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,540
tricky to set your pixels but grid units

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,210
you have to edit a configuration file

00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,860
and system but you're working on the new

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,440
I for that persistence and where you

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,590
just have a slider so you can you can

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,460
make it effectively the size of the UI I

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,900
grow to your liking so I say you you're

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,390
getting a little bit older and unique

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,600
glasses so you can tweak that size to

00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,310
whatever whatever you like we also have

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,470
to remember that this is a requirement

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,770
for having multiple screens right

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,050
because again if you have your phone

00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,750
phones are usually quite high density

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:10,810
these days connected to a standard HD

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,020
display that's today relatively low then

00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:16,450
low density screen rights and then we

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,910
have we have to sighs those that's you I

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,610
differently because it's either going to

00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,970
be huge and the monitor or really really

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,460
small on the on the phone so having we

00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,540
need to be able to have different values

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,540
for that per screen

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,920
alright a dragon bite is asking is unity

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,200
it going to be lighter on resources than

00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:51,620
unity seven since it's oriented towards

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:55,250
mobile we're hoping it kind of is

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,730
already right if you if you try to to

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:02,410
run into seven on a phone like one of

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:07,790
those that we've released the BQ 4.5 was

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:10,190
fairly a fairly low low spec phone and

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,920
you know it's it's working just fine

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,710
their compass was never written with

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:20,180
with these kinds of with like resource

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:22,280
constraints in mind and right so so we

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,860
had we had the again starting from

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,550
scratch on this kind of platform gave us

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,900
the advantage there but apart from apart

00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,920
from unit itself the whole ecosystem of

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:39,020
applications is more geared toward

00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:41,630
saving battery life memory etc because

00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,840
we have to we have to think about that

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,340
going going forwards right again because

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,030
you're not necessarily going to be using

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,830
your laptop anymore but my dear phone or

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:55,220
a tablet driving your home your whole

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:58,790
digital life so we have to we have to

00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,900
make sure that our a system works

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,900
follow up for all this

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,659
other really the high-end phones now are

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:12,779
right on par with my laptop which is

00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:15,570
three years old ill citing battery on

00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:17,429
that is a good thing this is true yeah

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:23,100
I'll take a longer battery life than my

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:25,860
laptop gets all right uh we're gonna

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,629
skip des Maguire's question about the

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,960
unity eight scopes redesign because i

00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:32,909
already answered that nightmare is

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,100
asking how will scopes be used on the

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,440
desktop i know we hit on that a little

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,350
bit but right now there's a pretty big

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
difference between the way you access or

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,419
the way the scopes look the dash looks i

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,049
should say on unity seven immunity eight

00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:50,759
are there any plans to make the unity

00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:55,789
eight dash a little more unity seven

00:32:50,759 --> 00:33:00,179
like there's some ongoing design work on

00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:03,330
taking the apps scope out of over out of

00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,429
the current scopes and kind of adding it

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,980
on to the launcher so it'll look and

00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:11,070
feel a little bit more similar to unity

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,039
oh sorry units of seven dash and aside

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,590
from that they are designs for scopes

00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,389
and desk on larger screens as well but

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:22,139
um I think the details of that are still

00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:23,759
being like that okay episode is designs

00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,889
been published or are used to working on

00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,869
this is very early we're literally

00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:29,639
reviewing it yesterday so hopefully

00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:37,460
we'll publish something on the blog in

00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:40,529
next few weeks okay all right a sub 3

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:43,080
bqm 10 HD you can guess what kind of

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:44,999
device he's on he's asking i know it's

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,639
being worked on but when is a bun to

00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:51,210
touch likely to really based on 1604

00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:53,669
unfortunately i don't think either of

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,990
our guests are involved in that so we

00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:57,840
don't have any better answer than we

00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:00,269
have in previous weeks but we can try

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,460
and have somebody from the phone

00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:04,230
foundation team on maybe next week or

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,789
the week after to answer those kinds of

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,270
questions well like i can probably

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:13,760
answer very vaguely that we the switch

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:15,590
is going to be two snaps and because

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,710
1604 so

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,770
support snaps natively already so as we

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,900
are switching the whole ecosystem from

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:27,830
the current system image and from clicks

00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,300
and so this is when this is when 1604

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,790
will become our base when we can

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,380
actually flip the switch from the

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:40,790
current infrastructure Connecticut

00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:43,250
system to snaps okay we still don't have

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:47,000
a real estimate on when that's going to

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,800
be the Dewey it's some going it's an

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,640
ongoing effort there's well the things

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,090
happening first snaps and on all fronts

00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:01,100
from cloud through IOT to personal which

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:04,130
is unity 8 and I'm open to that so

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:08,450
there's a lot of work that needs to

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:12,950
happen across the board so we'll get

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:14,810
there slowly all right dragon by it is

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,240
asking when a bun to phone is connected

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,520
to a projector for running an impress

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,650
presentation for instance will it show

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,750
up like on a mobile device or on the

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,570
desktop and I can actually answer this

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:29,900
one because at the beginning of this

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:33,230
year at the rubicon at scale I actually

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:36,680
did this I took my nexus 4 and through a

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:39,410
series of Frankenstein cables and

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,350
converters I got it connected to their

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:44,900
VGA monitor the projector that they were

00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:47,870
using and I give a presentation using

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,660
the doc viewer app from my phone in

00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,490
front of a crowd of like 300 people so

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,250
it does show up like a desktop and it

00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,860
works like a desktop and I can confirm

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,080
that that was all working even earlier

00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:05,750
this year oh that's pretty awesome to do

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:09,200
I can just add to that that however you

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:11,090
want it to look we ultimately it's going

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,590
to be your choice which kind of

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,770
interface you want to have on a

00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,160
different screen we will take into

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,510
account input input devices so if you

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,240
have your keyboard and mouse connected

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,130
we will switch to desktop mode if you

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,790
disconnect them we will switch to tablet

00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,720
mode etc etc but oh

00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,860
affinity it's going to be our choice

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,470
right I should have mentioned I did they

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,960
actually have my bluetooth keyboard and

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,210
mouse connected to it so it was working

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,630
as a desktop because of the one thing

00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,250
that I might add is right now we only

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,890
when when you connect to an external

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,500
screen the phone screen turns into a

00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,260
virtual touchpad kind of thing which

00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,540
lets you control the mouse cursor this

00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,960
would this is just one of the use cases

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,790
we envision for for your phone while

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,880
it's being connected to an external

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:07,700
screen but for the most part it's going

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,740
to remain being a phone right now it's

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,500
it's switching into a virtual touchpad

00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,290
thing but later that virtual touchpad

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,970
thing will most likely become a nap if

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,980
you want to use the user to use this

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,730
feature you will launch the vehicle

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:25,580
touchpad if you want to use it as a

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:27,470
presentation remote then there will be

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,680
an app that will let you easily switch

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:33,560
sides and if if your external screen is

00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,110
your media center then your phone can

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,840
have the controls for your media center

00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:42,830
right so this is this is all about you

00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:46,010
know them second screen kind of

00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:49,370
experience and all of these will be

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,230
enabling as we go that would be cool to

00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:59,060
have this just like turn into a TV

00:37:51,230 --> 00:38:01,690
remote control very nice find I think it

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,520
can take the next one rock on is asking

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:08,180
when will the core apps be available as

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:12,700
snaps so some of them have been packaged

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:15,770
as snaps already like the calculator and

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,280
was the other one the clock they will

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:22,630
probably the first and and we learnt

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,920
quite a quite a bit converting them so

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,860
you're on unity 7 you can just install

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,230
them from the store but as we said

00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:33,560
earlier there's still some work to be

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:37,850
done for them to be able to go on the on

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,370
the phone as well so yeah it's its work

00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,440
in progress I think and some more are

00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:46,240
being

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,280
that's right now so it's all happening

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,490
in 88 is being packaged as a snap right

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,400
now we're working on it hard so that we

00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:58,220
can deliver unity updates to people that

00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:05,380
want them in a timely manner without

00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:09,830
waiting for for anyone to read right so

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:13,520
how does how does it work who's going to

00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:15,800
get it where the updates are again I are

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,760
going to be it's going to be a system

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,170
update will a snap update right the

00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
ultimate thing especially for your phone

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,680
maybe not necessary for desktop but

00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,560
ultimate thing for your phone is

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,080
supposed to be there so that it's all a

00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,450
combination of snaps the kernel for the

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,620
phone is a snap the root file system is

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:38,780
the Boonta core is a snap then unity 8

00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,880
however we actually define it on top is

00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:44,390
going to be a snap and on top of that

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,480
the order will be there will be up app

00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,640
snaps as well all right so this will

00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,430
this will allow us to deliver all of

00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,700
those bits separately in Panama in a

00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:59,900
timely manner as we need to deliver them

00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:03,050
in a safe in a safe way may being sure

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,080
that your device does not get damaged to

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,060
her break by it right because it because

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,070
for whatever reason it fails in the

00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,870
middle of upgrading a package this

00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:15,290
doesn't happen with snaps right snaps

00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:17,960
are built with with this in mind so that

00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:21,770
you can just leave something in a

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,380
cupboard lose the key and as long as it

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:27,380
has power and internet access it will

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,620
work and get updates it will be secure

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:35,350
and you even will be able to extend its

00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,350
functionality and as it gets available

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,230
beautiful you guys

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:49,569
right the next question was from Mirage

00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:52,550
he asked he wants to get started in

00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:56,720
community engagement and want to know

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:58,819
how to get involved there so it depends

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,190
like if you're interested in in working

00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:05,569
with with local people like people in in

00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,849
kolkata on india and joining the the

00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:10,910
indian local team is probably your best

00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:14,510
option so i gave out a link earlier

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:17,569
which has more links to mailing list

00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,930
forum and then whatever else and just

00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:24,410
get in touch with them and and see what

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:26,599
kind of help the team needs maybe you

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,210
want to organize a meetup or you just

00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:32,300
want you I don't know help help others

00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,220
solve problems or something there's

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,200
usually lots to be done in locals and

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,530
they're going to be happy to have some

00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,140
help and if you want to more generally

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,170
work with the with the wider good to

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:49,250
community you can join the root q dash

00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:51,109
community dash team list just google for

00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,839
it and it's probably going to be the

00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:56,119
first hit and and there you can get to

00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:01,390
know all the people who are involved in

00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:04,040
community engagement but we also have

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:08,119
your head against a the IRFU channel oh

00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:11,930
yes yeah same name IC channel and we

00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,540
have community google com so if you're

00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:18,349
generally unsure if you want to work on

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:21,290
I don't know documentation or artwork or

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,880
the desktop or the bug squad or testing

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:27,650
like all the options i claim there and

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,619
just take a look at it community able to

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:33,140
come and in fact on the front page there

00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,910
you'll see a big find a task button that

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,010
will ask you a couple questions about

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,480
your interest and then point you in the

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,240
direction of different projects where

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,220
those interests can be met so this

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,109
thing's like dachshund Qi like Daniel

00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,119
mentioned so if you want to get involved

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:50,980
in the wider Ubuntu community and

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,980
contributing that's a great way to start

00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,960
alright the next question is from

00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:59,180
dragonbyte is asking what is the biggest

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,680
project that design is working on with a

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:09,559
bun to so uni what's taking up your time

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:12,589
right now right now we publish the blog

00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,779
on the terminal redesign and somebody

00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:17,920
came forward to so that's a community

00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:20,089
corps app somebody came forward to

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,269
volunteer to work in that so I'm getting

00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:26,240
specs by the design specs ready for that

00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:28,490
very generous developer and then the

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,130
system settings for the unity desktop is

00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,440
taking a lot of my time right now so

00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,740
this there's a lot of new settings that

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,099
were not required on phones before but

00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:42,769
on I required on desktop so that takes

00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:44,240
qualité of my time of the Roman now the

00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:46,880
rest of the design team is working on

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,279
yeah mostly emergent specifically

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,990
desktop focused unitary stuff at the

00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:59,059
moment so there's a lot of work going on

00:43:50,990 --> 00:44:00,920
that alone alright dragonbyte ass since

00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:02,390
the two color logo was introduced to

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,690
make a bun to and canonical more

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,650
enterprise friendly could the commute

00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,230
community-focused version use the

00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,579
multicolored logo instead so I don't

00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,980
think that's why we changed the logo

00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:15,890
color we still have with the new logo

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,230
we've got specific guidelines for

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,940
community focused projects and

00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,309
enterprise-focused projects and that

00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,259
changes the color scheme of it a little

00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:32,509
bit but that's not why we got rid of the

00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:34,730
old color logo so yeah for community

00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:37,190
stuff still use the current logo use

00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,619
lots of oranges I think they're still

00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:42,759
design guidelines on like the the dot

00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:46,430
patterns to use to distinguish a

00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:50,029
community from enterprise stuff but

00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:52,279
mostly just stick up orange it was DD

00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:55,819
4814 was the color code but I think you

00:44:52,279 --> 00:45:01,180
guys have changed that have you I think

00:44:55,819 --> 00:45:03,830
that changed for ya hold this place on

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:10,820
devices and web water as far

00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:12,770
another bring Carla second okay scopes

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,630
is asking the unity greeter seems

00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,280
untouched since the first phone

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,710
announcement are there any plans to

00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,310
improve it so actually I know from being

00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:24,320
on the proposed channel that it's gone

00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:27,050
back and forth a couple times with the

00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:30,680
sub iterations can you guys speak to

00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:32,540
what's going on with the greeter so good

00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,640
timing we have a silo right now it

00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,580
should land within within a few days and

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,620
I'm working on getting it into our

00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:47,390
quality teams hands and it will be a

00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:51,170
again a convergent exercise right so the

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:55,310
greeter between the phone and the tablet

00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:59,480
and the desktop use cases will get much

00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:03,110
more much more consistent there's a

00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,890
there's a bit of a visual refresh I'm

00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:11,750
liking it really so stay tuned it should

00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:13,370
only happen if you look all right yeah

00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,930
we're going to try and go through these

00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,360
a little bit quicker because we do have

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,040
a lot of questions still so dears

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,720
McGuire is asking are there any plans to

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,090
start shipping the phone images with

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,860
more than one default wallpaper only one

00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:32,660
wallpaper on a new device is a bit of a

00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:37,340
letdown same answer stay tuned it's the

00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:39,650
same side of action okay so we will be

00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:44,330
shooting them and basically the default

00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:46,480
set from open to itself so so these will

00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,550
be the same the same wallpapers

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,220
initially we will what they will there

00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:54,560
will not be a way for you to crop them

00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,510
to your liking but we have we have

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,120
designs for actually allowing you to

00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:02,210
pick the one piece of that image that

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:05,600
you are that you like very much and use

00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,190
that as your as your wallpaper and will

00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,360
you be able to use that feature for

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,860
pictures you take also first yes good

00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,050
that would be nice because I've been

00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:19,300
having to like line up my shot to make

00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,300
sure it fits right in the infographics

00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:28,700
alright as scoops is asking has the

00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:30,170
notification revamp going and so it had

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,109
to be pricked a little bit on the back

00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,970
burner because notifications are working

00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:38,260
there's improvements that need to happen

00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:42,650
at least as far as the backend and

00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:45,350
feature site maybe but this is again

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:48,980
where people have been focused on snaps

00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:51,770
all around and this this got pushed down

00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,869
a road map addage but it's still there

00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:59,000
we still want to make it happen we still

00:47:53,869 --> 00:48:01,760
know that it has to improve all right

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,260
scopes again is asking it seems that a

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,960
bunch of touch does not have any

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:10,550
transparency or blur in the menus and

00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:13,490
dialogues etc why is that so we've got

00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:16,880
um we use intercession is something that

00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:18,740
looked at a couple times we use blur in

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,260
a few places at the memo so for instance

00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:24,800
the new greater so i think we'll use it

00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:28,100
at least it was in design some the tasks

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,140
which uses blur I think the launcher has

00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:34,640
blown the background and the camera app

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,680
uses blur so we are looking looking at

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,560
using it where it makes sense I mean

00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:44,780
blow is quite competition elite heavy

00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:47,720
algorithm so we've kind of we've got a

00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,609
version of heavily optimized scoring

00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,250
player Burrell Burrell at one of our

00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,619
developers who's got a long history and

00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,780
game development has has worked on this

00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:58,280
really really fast at the moment I think

00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,580
it runs out something like hundred

00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,770
frames per second a full screen but so

00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:07,670
we still kind of finding the use guesses

00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:10,580
where it's more than just kind of you

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:12,770
know visual show off so there's a real

00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,410
you spirit and potentially in the new

00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:18,680
could be an expert in experimenting

00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:22,609
using blurring the the new kind of a app

00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,830
dash that would come from the launcher

00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:26,359
that would look a little bit similar but

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,250
much better than on you know seven so

00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,869
stay tuned for that one we've got a bit

00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,430
more on that will definitely blog the

00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:33,319
blog about that back

00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,119
essentially we'd like to use it what it

00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:38,589
makes sense probably a little bit more

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,930
than the moment but not all of the show

00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:44,510
it scopes ask why the bun to store icon

00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:49,730
in the app scope is so big and different

00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:51,319
from all the others I get again I think

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,869
that will change with the new designs

00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:55,990
and at least once I see notes and

00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:58,250
remember that the doctor stethoscope

00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:01,599
status to the App Store which much

00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:04,339
different luck in Ryazan sir right

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,960
nightmare ass how close is unity 18

00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:12,829
production-ready on the desktop depends

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:16,430
depends on what you're producing but for

00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:19,490
the most most common use cases it's

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:22,790
already there if if what apps you have

00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:24,559
on your phone just in a bigger form

00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:27,079
factor suits you so you have your

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:30,230
browser you have your you have your

00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:34,309
communicator or etc that was already

00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:37,510
work so we are we are ourselves trying

00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:40,250
to spend as much as possible time and

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:44,150
initiate just to see what's missing

00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:47,270
exactly but I think the this is what

00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,829
what was mentioned before apps are the

00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,280
only thing that's really missing and

00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:55,640
that said we're in the desktop

00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,660
environment you can already run via

00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,670
small trick which is called X near and

00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,109
liberty in which which lets you run apps

00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,200
and try the container you can already

00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:08,900
run apps that you have on in 27 today

00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,190
they don't behave exactly exactly the

00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:16,369
same because they go through a layer of

00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,910
proxy and but we're working right now

00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:22,490
and it's a it's a matter of weeks before

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,770
we can actually enable full window

00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:28,670
management in which case we will go back

00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:30,890
to enabling native new support for four

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:36,020
tickets where where it makes sense and

00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:38,390
and even through ex mere putting apps in

00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,569
a different way in that its unity 8

00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:45,550
knowing each of their surfaces beat

00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:48,830
menus or toe tips instead of like today

00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,109
they're being a small window manager

00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:54,710
within X near that does that for us

00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:58,130
still yeah having Multi Windows support

00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:00,770
i think was the biggest thing that i

00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,790
needed to start using unity 8 so

00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:06,950
actually no the window support as in

00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:08,300
have multiple windows of a browser this

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:12,560
is supported already for a few months

00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:15,260
but there's just no abusing but there is

00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,080
a there is a silo with with a multi

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,430
windowed browser that so again this this

00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,250
particular feature should be there

00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:25,580
within within days more than weeks and

00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:31,430
so we will be able to to open a window

00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:34,850
of the ubuntu browser a separate one and

00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:41,510
it will be managed as if as you would

00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:44,780
expect it great um Drago's ass when is

00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:47,930
Pokemon go coming to a bun to phone it

00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,880
will be there as soon though yes or

00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:53,540
denying tech probably more accurately

00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,040
not once once niantic in nintendo wanted

00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,960
on Yvonne to phone it will be there

00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,400
there are the only ones who can make

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,690
that happen scope says when the calendar

00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,600
app will be updated with the latest

00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:10,100
design guides we saw some images on the

00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,560
blog design some months ago yeah I

00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,470
worked on that the on those designs so

00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,320
the designs are ready we are looking for

00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:21,890
a community developer to come on board

00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,720
that the previous one unfortunately damn

00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,940
time constraints I think you got any job

00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,130
had to move country so is not working on

00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,410
that calendar no more so if you're

00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:34,369
interested in contributing and if you

00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:36,080
were reasonably good with TMO and C++

00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:39,980
then probably more more cumulative

00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:44,350
person and please come forward down send

00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:47,330
an email to alan cook or myself yoni and

00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:50,960
or comment on the blog will reach

00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:52,670
through that yeah a lot of our apps are

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,980
developed by the community we give

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:56,780
design resources we help them with

00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,089
infrastructure and packaging and getting

00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,289
it in but we really need community

00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:01,880
people to help us with the actual

00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:04,489
development of a lot of these so that's

00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,059
a great way to get started qml is easy

00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:10,880
these apps are well documented and again

00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:14,469
contact Alan Pope he's puppy on IRC d

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:19,009
and he can help you get started on that

00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:24,380
um let's see sub 3 says we missed a

00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:28,460
question about OTA 13 let's see if i can

00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:31,390
find that real quick yeah yeah lifted ok

00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,130
thought he was going to be tomorrow but

00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,509
what I would like added I do not know

00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:39,190
check the phone mailing list that's

00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:39,190
usually where those announcements happen

00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:46,369
alright uh dragonbyte isn't asking our

00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,710
web apps still available in unity aight

00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:51,499
i heard it was being deprecated but is

00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:53,869
it going something going away or just

00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:55,670
put on the back burner so there's two

00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:58,609
different things that you might mean by

00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:01,249
web apps one is just the simple web app

00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:03,319
container which we have on the phone and

00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:05,180
tablet right now and as far as I know

00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:07,489
that's not going away that's going to

00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:10,160
continue and we'll just use that on the

00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:12,710
desktop the same way the other thing was

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,099
desktop integration which we did with

00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:19,009
plugins for firefox and chromium I think

00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:21,380
that's being replaced by this new web at

00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:23,630
container because it's something that

00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,940
we've got more control of with the

00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:29,359
plugins we kept having to chase changes

00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,799
to the api's and stuff that the browsers

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,630
were doing in addition to chasing

00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,309
changes to the web sites themselves and

00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:41,450
that just became a huge maintenance

00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:43,309
burden on us all right with the move to

00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,019
the web app container as it is on the

00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:48,710
phone and the developer has much more

00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:51,049
control right so so you will be able as

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:54,799
a developer of the office web up to to

00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:57,619
make the integration happen and you

00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:02,119
won't rely on us trying to play catch up

00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:05,809
with with the web sites themselves right

00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,940
and they're adding a bunch of api's to

00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:10,519
that container both some standard ones

00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,710
and some non-standard ones the support

00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:15,470
notifications even push notifications

00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:17,089
now are out and are being added to the

00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,490
oxide container so those are going to be

00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:23,420
a lot more functional than even what we

00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:25,160
had before on the desktop and the last

00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,589
question perfect timing is from

00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,170
dragonbyte he's asking is there anything

00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:41,270
like live tiles available for unity or

00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:43,280
scopes sure we black tiles are but I

00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:46,580
suppose something that will get updated

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,510
over time well I think he's referring to

00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:53,510
the windows tiles that were introduced

00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:56,599
with the windows 8 where you can update

00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,950
different aspects of those and we have a

00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:59,690
little bit of that on the launcher

00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,099
already we've had that for a while with

00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:05,480
like the count indicators in the

00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:07,160
progress and whatnot has there been any

00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,310
discussion about adding that kind of

00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,869
thing to like the app scope I know you'd

00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:15,380
mentioned earlier maybe separating that

00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:17,450
out from the dash so the app scope

00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,890
itself should be as close to de launch

00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,839
our items as possible that we've always

00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:23,270
planned that whether that's going to be

00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:30,200
available to other scopes and in what

00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:31,910
way we'll have to see all right and with

00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,570
that we are out of time and out of

00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:36,859
questions thank you mcallen uni for
