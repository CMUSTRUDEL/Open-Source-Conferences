00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,280
week of the 12 community Q&A and this is

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,469
the opportunity to ask anything that you

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,650
want to know about want to open source

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,070
and anything that we can give you an

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,480
answer for um the only questions that we

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,630
generally don't answer are the ones

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,330
about support work you can get better

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,420
information on better suited channels

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,960
such as ask ubuntu forums or the mailing

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,980
list other than that it's pretty much

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,030
ask whatever you want just remember to

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,899
prepend your questions with the word

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:47,489
questions on IRC so that we can easily

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:52,170
spot them if you're seeing us and if

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,059
you're on IRC as its traditional if you

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,350

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,170
light those are like David's backdrops

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:13,239
so this is my money I used to use the

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,709
backdrop chicken all right okay cool so

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,280
let's are with the with the

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:22,299
announcements this this week with we've

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,880
had some some quite a lot of exciting

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:30,820
news lately one of the ones were one of

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,269
them was tablet announcement conversions

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,920
announcements converted becoming real

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,340
and we'll talk this about this in more

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:45,640
detail with Pat and Richard later on but

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:49,810
also with we've had 12 running as part

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,620
of as an organization in the Google

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,739
coding program which for which the

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,530
winners which were just announced very

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,470
recently we've had some winners from who

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,870
contributed to 12 and I think Nick

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,630
what's tell us a bit more how Google

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,880
Colleen went who the winners when were

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,370
and essentially your thoughts and

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,459
actually being one of the organizers or

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,260
mentors sure and you know I wanted to

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,700
lead in with some great stats but

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,560
they're slipping my mind at the moment I

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,710
want to say

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,260
we had I know we had more than 200

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,419
students I don't know if it was how many

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,470
more than that it was I want to say we

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:37,360
did 500 tasks I might be right but

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,480
anyways we had the difficult Athiya

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,460
tearing down all the students and taking

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,540
a look at at their work and Google

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,780
actually gives us the opportunity to

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,639
look at the the top 10 and pick five for

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,230
actual winners and that was that was

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,419
really really difficult and on top of

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,370
that we have to pick two to actually be

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,050
grand prize winners or finalists

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,360
whatever they call them I get confused

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,139
and those who actually are going to win

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,120
a trip to to Google itself and so

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,370
matthew allen x cub where r 2 grand

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,700
finalists big congratulations to both of

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,290
you and we had like i said picking even

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,970
picking the top five is difficult and

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,840
picking you know just having to pick two

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,960
of those to be grand finalists winners

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,940
was very hard so for everyone who who

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,460

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,100

magic google Summer of Code we know we

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,699

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:04,940
I don't I don't want to spoil anything

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,529
but so summer code opened a google

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,050
Summer of Code open applications this

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,970
week so for those of you who have may

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,980

apply we will be undertaking an

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,420
application but that means we're going

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,980
to be looking forward in needing mentors

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,480

mind as you apply next month and and

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,829
look to do google Summer of Code

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,260
yourself so anyways they'll be more

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:34,310
announcements later on it'll it'll fill

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,110
i would give a little tease anyway to

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,180
continue the runner yes critical plugin

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:46,550
and that's still in progress so keep

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,350
google summer of code in mind and son

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:53,120
all right then so let's have a look at

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,649
the i receive questions are piling up so

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,279
i'm gonna skip before i'm going to keep

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:02,899
the tablet ones but i will hit them to

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,459
answer later on so think if a known is

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,790
taking the first question is from and

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:10,250
rio hazen if translations are made to a

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,240
project which is actually upstream for

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,920
example to translations made maybe

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,800
not but get automatically pushed up

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,829
streamed although they have to be pushed

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,740
manually or do they not get pushed at

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:30,260
all essentially the way it works is that

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,449
i cannot really give you a straight

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,399
answer thing but let me just give you a

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,680
bit of context context first i mean i

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,559
can't give you a straight answer what i

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:45,290
mean is that have to explain a bit more

00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:52,939
how this works first um generally what

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:54,170
is generated by by teams of but what

00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:56,600
would i buy what we call her

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,189
localization teams there are generally

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,649
one thing for each for each language

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:04,309
although there are teams which take care

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:08,720
of of of several different languages but

00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:10,970
these are generally the exception what

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,769
the windows relators do through these

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,800
things is to actually translate all of

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:20,449
the distribution or all of the u.s. of

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,760
the OS x by going to translations of

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,480
lunch battle.net and picking a release

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:31,010
and then within that release picking a

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:34,699
particular project taking as an

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,949
example then these translations made it

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:40,100
into a forward to as part of

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:43,209
language packs and there is no automated

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:47,510
way of seeking these translations

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:50,209
upstream there have been work in order

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:54,350
to make this difficult sorry make this

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:56,860
easier well a while ago when we used to

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:02,920
have a launch pad translations

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:05,779
engineering team and this was made by

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,660
pushing translations automatically to to

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,270
a branch and then being able to turn in

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,210
turn

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,610
those branches into upstream I've only

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,860
got that work never got completely

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,540
implemented so that the way that it

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,990
works right now is that translations are

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:25,380
generally pushed up stream by the

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,420
translations team manually several

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,290
different teams have got 70 / several

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,970
different workflows some teams gently

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,420
first in 12 in lodge but because they

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,370
like the UI they it makes it easier to

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,250
do the translation themselves and then

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,100
they they download those translations

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,920
and push them up stream again manually

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,280
or some teams decide to translate all

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,010
the upstream and then for distant

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,570
relations to get imported into into

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,410
lunch but which is something that that

00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,450
happens automatically and then if there

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,750
are any additional contributions maybe

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,360
not but then they kept them back to us

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,210
to upstream so I think the straight

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,690
answer is there is no automated export

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:16,530
of of translated translations what clubs

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,980
do projects that are outside of launch

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:23,910
pad if these relations are hosted in

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,240
much but the the the exports happen

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:31,290
automatically and where there's not a

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,240
automated export and then translation

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,670
teams are there to take care of making

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,330
sure that there's a workflow to to work

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:41,370
with with our street in any direction so

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,630
a convoluted answer but if you've gotten

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,800
in any questions on any particular

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,800
aspects just let me know

00:14:52,029 --> 00:15:00,290
all right then so we've comes the other

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,790
tablet but I'm trying to trying to sort

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:10,430
them and save them for later from Pat

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:12,980
and Robert come on so um I think the

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,320
next question it's not tablet specific

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,959
is about the hood Chloe look the girls

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,870
well sorry I picked his 50 shimmers

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,790
first he says seeing you 12 in cars and

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,980
devices really exciting but it got me

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,690
wondering when he bunted car powered car

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,430
crashes or the fridge burns the house

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,839
down and the others start suing everyone

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,430
in sight will be anything separate

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,519
canonical from the manufacturer who

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,019
integrated the system as we know it will

00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:41,720
happen is this something canonical is

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:51,220
preparing for is sort of concerned about

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:51,220
our lawsuit happy world um I mean um I

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,470
think it's morally the same as in i

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,480
think the car makes a bit more if you

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:04,699
can do different because yeah it's like

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,730
the protection is if it's a bit devices

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:11,899
it's also something that that can put a

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,380
person's life at retreat when there's

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:17,570
when there's an as an accident but

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,730
there's always this same relationship

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,250
between canonical and the manufacturer

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,699
as well i mean i cannot really explain

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,980
how how the legalese works because i'm

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,630
not part of the legal team but one thing

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,600
that i can assure you that canonical has

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,970
got a very competent legal team and

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,310
whenever canonical engages with with a

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,860
manufacturer with a with a partner and

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,949
the legal team or legal teams on both

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,730
sides are are involved to make sure that

00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:50,779
that everything is done correctly and

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:55,880
then but every every parties is well

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:58,250
covered yes and to be fair speaking

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,880
generally you know if you wreck your car

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:04,310
now or your fridge burns your house down

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
i guess you can do anything you want but

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,700
I don't think there's precedent for

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,200
blaming the car company for something

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,240
you do so I don't think this is a

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,770
problem that's unique to us nor is it

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,350
something that suppose we should really

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:23,720
be overly concerned the next collection

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,850
I it's not tablet specific I think it's

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,330
from playful girl and she asks is there

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:35,120
any hood update I think that's the

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:39,340
that's Khloe's question the curing

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,920
question so I think since ever since the

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,290
last time for bodies I haven't been any

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:50,030
any updates I know that there has been

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:52,130
when I remember at a 20 cannot scale

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:56,750
actually on the live Q&A with the with

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:58,370
the design team then there was actually

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,700
someone in the audience discussing the

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:04,190
same as in the same question I mean the

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,460
answer from joni from the design from

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,040
design team um you can actually go and

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,860
check it out on the on the YouTube

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,010
skills stream but if i remember

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,530
correctly was that the design team are

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:24,200
always looking at different ways of

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:28,100
interfacing the two devices with with

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,730
users so that is one of them and in

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,040
terms of in terms of engineer work going

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,440
on right now there is there is not much

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:41,330
going on being with being quite honest

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:44,900
but I said the design team are always

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,330
looking at the UX and innovative ways to

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,130
to make this interaction more commercial

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,130
to them to the used to the user

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:05,450
okay i think the next non tablet

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,129
question is there any progress on making

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,129
the dash in the unity 8 desktop

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:17,740
I think one thing that you might want to

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,900
to check out and after this I'm gonna

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,970
turn just going to step out of it and

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:26,110
turn on the light is becoming really

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,910
really dark in here wedding that you

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,410
should definitely check out if you earn

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:37,150
on 12 1604 is the unity a desktop

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:39,940
session which will which will show you

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:43,180
the actual progress of unity 8 running

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:51,420
on on an actual list of right now we've

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:53,890
got we've got scopes dash right now but

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,200
but yeah we're looking at ways of

00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:01,390
implementing the designs for for the

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:05,310
data on the desktop and there will be

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,310
one second and i'll be back in a minute

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:22,520
okay ah we can see David no I'm looking

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:36,680
for the next non tablet question there's

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:38,710
a lot of great questions in here coolio

00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:44,300
Wolfie girl i think is next again and

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:48,110
asking about you d 7 and walk on tablets

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,060
so she asked with you 1587 walk on

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,530
tablets they have a setting space and

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,530
system settings what's the plan for walk

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:59,240
on tablet support for drawing I assume

00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:02,060
that maybe she's talking about unity 8

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,920
i'm not i'm not sure but what can you

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:10,370
talk about what can you say about walk

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:13,190
on tablets anything um I mean I can't

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,650
speak from the user side of things and I

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:21,880
I've got a welcome tablet I don't use it

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:26,030
as much as as I used as I used to but

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,340
for unity 8 I mean I mean I understand

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:33,140
that the question is for unity 8 as in

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,580
unity 7 tablet just works of course

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,590
we're looking at other ways of

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,540
interfacing you and you input devices to

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:43,120
to unity to unity 8 i'm not sure the

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,430
tablet is the next one in the roadmap I

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,630
think things like making sure this

00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:55,310
better bluetooth support for desktop

00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,960
sorry for keyboard and a mouse and

00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,880
making sure that this could support for

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,630
interfacing with with monitors in

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,590
convergence motor are the next big

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:09,350
topics in the priority list but we're

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:13,370
looking we're looking at other input

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:16,400
devices as well today I think the best

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,250
thing might be perhaps to ask on on the

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,160
moon to dash desktop

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:28,200
channel in terms of input and co device

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,200
support on on unity 8

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,970
okay scanning I think again withers oh

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,130
there's a ton of its kind of excellent

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,210
tablet questions in here um I guess this

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,800
one's not supposed to the guy their

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,120
claim of a girl asks what are some

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,860
features you're looking forward to an

00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:00,250
OTA 10 and OTA 11 I think OTA 10 is

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,660
planned for about a month from now maybe

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,720
about three weeks from now something

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,980
like that and otay 11 is obviously much

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,850
further beyond that David you want to go

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,880
first I'd have to look at it myself to

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:21,310
be to be honest we we haven't even had a

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:25,030
9.5 858 so OTA 10 as far as i know is

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:28,870
planned for 4 March I don't think we've

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,570
got a date for 40 PA 11 yet but I mean

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:35,320
you can you can think of as a rule of

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:40,150
thumb it will be six weeks after the for

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:42,880
the match March OTA 10 Waddell do a

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:47,380
thing is i'll just refer you to the

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,020
Blackstone's page which is with what I

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,640
generally use myself to look at what we

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:56,830
look forward for the next OTA so I'm

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,500
just going to paste it here on IRC these

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:04,570
are the d these are the features and

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,430
impacts that we're targeting for each

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:15,150
OTA you see that OTA 9.5 and OTA 10 are

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:17,980
scheduled for of january and februari

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:21,250
just as a as a heads up these states

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:24,820
need updating okay 9.5 I think the

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:34,600
release is happening today and OTA 10 is

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:37,120
to be the beginning of march i think

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,000
what i'll do is i'll just send you a

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:47,100
link to the to the actual OTA for OTA 10

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,120
as the list of targeted books bugs is

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,570
really really huge

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,950
so I respect who a lot of fixes going on

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,630
what I'm looking for it actually and

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:06,040
that's not yet on these are the new apps

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:09,940
that were planning to to add to this to

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,280
this next OTAs one is going to be deco

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,620
and the other one I'll leave it as a

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:21,250
surprise for the next Q&A perhaps whoo

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,080
he's staying hush-hush all right just

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,150
some guesses I want to see IRC explode

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,750
now what can what could be the next ball

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,880
tap for me i'm looking forward to VPN

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:42,690
support which i hope supposed to land

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:42,690
but i hope it does so let's see uh

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,429
dragonbyte wants to know when the next

00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,490
big announcement three bunty phones is

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:59,410
likely i think that's fairly easy to

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:01,510
answer actually mwc is coming up this

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,370
month I'm guessing if if we're going to

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,320
see any announcements I'm that we would

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,210
see something happen there I know you

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,640
bunt to will be there I cannot be there

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,280
and we'll be talking about fun stuff so

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:17,070
when is the actual day for mwc then I

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,870
think the 20 a hacer tu eka too heavy or

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:25,660
twenty third thing is a week of in any

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:30,160
cases we chose the 22nd of every so two

00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:36,340
weeks all right then so yes something

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:39,760
guesses on arrested I'm thinking I mean

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,320
I see some some some things though that

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,390
I would expect that also expects

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:48,690
something that perhaps hasn't been

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,690
discussed on on of this child

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,320
alright so we could let me just pick

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,930
another question from Chloe well vehicle

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,330
one can install wounded personnel on a

00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,820
laptop desktop with it being all snappy

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:11,710
based rather than having it in an Alexi

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:16,630
container i think i'm going to give you

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:19,570
perhaps not so definitive answer but

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:24,460
it's going to be after after 16 after

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:26,110
1604 I mean I i'm not expecting I mean

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,500
right now we're music preparing the next

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:33,190
LTS I'm not expecting any news on wood

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:39,990
personal as in having a testable image

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:43,650
before the end of of 1604 but we want to

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:48,280
to revamp the given to personal efforts

00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:51,970
after the after the or and on the way 20

00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:55,060
to 60 no for release and and Yan expect

00:27:51,970 --> 00:28:02,460
to see to see some news in that

00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:06,220
direction after 1604 all right then and

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:09,550
we've got Richard Collins joining

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:13,060
joining us welcome Richard hi David

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:17,200
hello Richard is the product manager for

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:19,240
our horrible two devices and is the

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,900
person we've been saving all of the

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,210
tablet questions for you get quality of

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,570
excitement on on IRC about the new

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,430
tablet announcements and I see that putt

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,330
joining two interests well so welcome

00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:37,450
part hey guys I played PLATUS the

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:41,110
engineering director in charge of the

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:48,070
phone give a tablet any channel devices

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:49,930
devices projects on a pontoon um Nick I

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:56,440
think we queued up some of the questions

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:58,030
you insert picking a first ones sure let

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,940
you start at the top there's a there's a

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,370
lot of questions I'll be trying the

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,310
crime pick up repeat but if I ask you

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,650
one where you just tell me that

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,810
the first one is wondering why a retired

00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,430
arm tablet and not an x86 tablet

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:17,380
basically they're mentioning wanting to

00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:21,360
play steam okay I mean well the Kiwis

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:24,910
for that is because we're working with

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:28,300
an oem the manufacturers arm-based

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:32,350
devices so we will equally love to work

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,540
with a an oem that ships next x86 we

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:37,560
know how to win how to run the product

00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:41,350
on x86 it's just that we have more

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:51,310
advanced discussions with arm-based OEMs

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:53,140
it's this that's the simple answer XO j

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,390
& XD asks one will the tablet be

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,100
released in near and we'll be through be

00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,870
huge snapdeal and what about accessories

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,770
they're just wanting to know about India

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:06,040
villages in India okay that's so we will

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,390
be talking step deal about making kind

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,800
of profitable there there are no plans

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:15,100
to have it in India but it will be

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:19,450
available the first case and directly

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,770
from be cute but we have as as we know

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,150
we have arrangements in place with

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,760
distributors in other parts of the world

00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,930
and we will be looking to make it more

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,800
widely available through those

00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:33,730
distribution partners as well final so

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:39,460
try not all right um next question is

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:40,630
wondering what is with the tablets in

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,830
other words what new and improved

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,220
features or have been worked on

00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:48,250
specifically for the tablet okay there's

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,350
a few so first off you know we're

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:55,150
introducing a side stage capability so

00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:57,850
the ability to run two apps on the

00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,280
display at the same time so I'm sure

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,480
sighs stages is familiar with everybody

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:06,070
in terms of how that works it's

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,610
effectively we you can launch an

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:12,610
application that is developed to run on

00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:15,790
that in a kind of mobile interface which

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,440
which swipes in from the right of the

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,370
display and then we had the concept of

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,160
what's called a main stage

00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:26,130
application running alongside I stage

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,960
application and if in the idea is you

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,910
can you can as I say you can interact

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,179
with two applications at the same time

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:35,039
so that's great for things like WebRTC

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,539
applications for example having a video

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,419
called running inside stage perhaps

00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,860
while you're browsing or using some

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,809
other reference application that's

00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,100
necessary for the call so lots of pretty

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,690
interesting use cases about how you

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,240
might want to use two applications at

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,740
once and we're going to be engineering

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,100
some real flexibility into that so the

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,500
ability to grab and drag applications

00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,919
from mainstage decide station and and

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,539
vice versa so as a bitter there's a new

00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,380
way in which the applications can be

00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:06,179
displayed on the tablet then of course

00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,559
the really big story about what we're

00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,659
launching with the title is the ability

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,480
to turn it into a fully-fledged of them

00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:17,340
to pc so by connecting a mouse or

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:22,010
keyboard you instantly turn the the

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:28,039
tablet into a PC a full pc interface

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:30,870
this this obviously has huge advantages

00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,669
in terms of turning it into a

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,470
Productivity tool as well as well as

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:36,809
something that is completely mobile and

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,600
touch based so we're very very excited

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:41,250
about the idea of bringing true

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,570
conversions to the market we think it's

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,720
something that nobody else is really

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:48,270
doing in in the same way so obviously

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,429
Apple isn't doing anything in terms of

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:55,470
true PC convergence Microsoft has its

00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,929
continuum which is a form of convergence

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,150
but isn't really the same thing we're

00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:02,880
doing Windows 10 as a smartphone

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,740
platform is still different to Windows

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,530
10 as a PC platforms they don't have

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,990
real OS convergence in the same way that

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,169
we do and so this is this is this is a

00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,610
unique offering that we work we're

00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:16,460
putting into this product here and we're

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:20,789
very excited about the idea of having

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,470
our first real milestone in terms of OS

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:27,259
convergence running on running on this

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:31,469
tablet each is awesome

00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:34,379
all right um this isn't for a question

00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:39,389
will the tablet Lee based on snappy and

00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:41,279
and and or are you bunch before so the

00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:44,070
last bit and or open to what's the ring

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
I you munchy 1604 presumably they're

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,399
wondering what release you're gonna have

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,460
64 bits in it or not uh so well it won't

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,989
be run on sappy at this stage but the

00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:02,009
roadmap around everything we do in terms

00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:04,769
of our product strategy is will bring

00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:08,490
snappy into the picture it at the right

00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:12,779
time I believe it's going to be based on

00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:15,029
1510 Pat is that correct so yeah but I

00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:18,240
mean we were stolen bases worship it

00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:21,240
with leather devices so that'll be the

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:37,500
case for several months we will move to

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:39,329
16 floors okay next question teklords

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,319
asks will the users of the bungee tablet

00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,349
be able to change the desktop

00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:46,679
environment so presumably is wondering

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:48,329
about I'm guessing in convergence mode

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,210
if he doesn't want to run unity but he

00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:55,079
wants to run open box or something is

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,829
that exactly a possibility for me it's

00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:03,380
not no so what we what will run on the

00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:11,640
desktop it's called burn unit e eight

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:13,260
with all of the existing catalog of cute

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,539
apps that are running in the store right

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,299
now that have been growing you know

00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:20,760
since we launched about your smartphone

00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:25,940
in addition to that we have a specific

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:28,920
container which will be available to run

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,849
legacy x11 applications such as

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:36,990
LibreOffice Firefox there's you know

00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:40,860
we're running a no my OC x chat client

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:43,230
we're running game g edit

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,720
so we'll have we'll have a pre-installed

00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,970
selection of excerpts of a run there's

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,430
also the ability to use the command line

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,310
interface to access the archived and

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:57,780
installed directly other apps if they're

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,970
of interest but but yeah that's so in

00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,180
terms of the unity eighth offering kit

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:06,180
it's broadly speaking that's that's what

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:15,870
the that's what will run on the product

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:19,170
and at this stage it makes sense um next

00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,580
question spill this is actually being

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,990
filed question so they said the tablets

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,180
gonna come with Libre Office and

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,520
Firefox pre-installed I guess you can

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,820
confirm or deny that right yeah what

00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,330
will we see them in store in other words

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,970
will it be I don't know I don't know I

00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,260
guess that's an interesting question but

00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,370
why don't you want to answer that so

00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,350
they'll be pre-installed is that

00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,900
something like Bobby Ellis a get firefox

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,280
and from the Ubuntu store will always be

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,200
something that I have to go to compare

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:54,180
mine and install so we have specifically

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,800
packaged a set of apps and the main ones

00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,360
which were mentioned there so Libre

00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,700
Office G at it and and Firefox so they

00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:08,070
they won't they won't be available in

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:10,050
the store that there's a specific piece

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:15,470
of work that we are we're looking at

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:21,300
about how we start to enable the store

00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:24,150
over time to make more and more desktop

00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,250
specific apps available but our main

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,980
focus really is encouraging people to

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,540
build desktop apps in the native cute

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,970
environments and of course that's

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,840
something that the store is readily

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:39,780
available to support right now so mirror

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,290
for example is it's very well

00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,990
established and there are many types of

00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:47,970
desktop applications that can easily

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,500
enable a mere back in and have them

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:54,110
running as a

00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,820
on the on this product and have them

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,280
package and available in the store so

00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,530
that the store is very much to possibly

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:07,640
the store as it stands right now is very

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:09,500
much it has the possibility to to allow

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,900
applications to be you know sort of

00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,060
ailable and installed but at this stage

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,200
in terms of launch you know we are we

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:21,290
have selected a number of apps that run

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,410
that experiment that x11 container that

00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,240
that we run as a pre install but not

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:38,180
without but not with support directly

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:40,790
from from the store at this stage all

00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,680
right dragomir tasks an easy question is

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,140
asking if the tablet runs the energy

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,240
seven or unity eight obviously fermenter

00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,730
that I run senior BJP and I think we've

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,290
also answered the fact that unity seven

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,560
or other desktop environments kind of an

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:57,170
out of the boxes is not a another option

00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,110
um the question curious about

00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,430
orientation awareness so does the tablet

00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,170
have orientation awareness once

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:07,790
connected the amount keyboard mouse and

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:12,620
monitor I'm not sure what it would be to

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:14,590
desire portrait and then it's not a use

00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,290
case we've tested actually but no it's

00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,090
it's it's fixed at landscape as you

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:28,160
would expect for a pit for a typical pc

00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:29,720
interface here is a good question so you

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,570
mentioned earlier you mentioned side

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,980
stage and this question is actually

00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:40,660
about a tablet mode and there's new

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:43,130
pictures your new images there

00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,240
presumably will probably have a you guys

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,710
would probably have a press release it

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,080
soon enough but they're just curious for

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,430
some new images and new examples of what

00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,020
this tablet mode looks like and what

00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,299
side stations like what looks like that

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:59,479
one on the on the real tablet and

00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:02,180
ok so it's there are images being

00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:03,979
released there's a pretty comprehensive

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:08,299
set on our website under the devices

00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:13,069
section that we were showing on the m10

00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:15,229
de um 10 so the website has some

00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:19,940
some some pretty good visuals in terms

00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:22,910
of what what that looks like I mean at

00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,269
mwc we're going to be fully focused on

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:29,779
I'm promoting it and demonstrating it so

00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:32,150
you know there'll be a lot of a lot of

00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:34,489
collateral coming out from that as well

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,769
I imagine so but at the moment i think

00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:40,069
the differencing website is the best

00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:43,489
place to get a mediate idea about how we

00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:46,039
will look run on the hardware ok

00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:47,960
excellent I think think if you get

00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,829
inside so many bugs to calm my thinking

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,989
I'd monster for what rich is talking um

00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:58,960
next question is the tablet going to be

00:40:53,989 --> 00:41:02,509
usable for drawing look Rita Ora

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,190
 runs on the tablet so so yeah

00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:06,979
that's an application that you'd like to

00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:11,059
use for drawing then that's that's there

00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:13,369
for you and can you is it possible to

00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:18,410
use the the tablet itself as a touch

00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:22,460
input as a person to using the mouse so

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:25,150
would yes that mode a ya so hit you have

00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,499
you have access to all the touch up the

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,059
full touch input when it's in desktop

00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:34,160
mode obviously when you're talking about

00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:39,650
desktop specific applications you're not

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:42,559
getting the right kind of it's not it's

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,869
not designed for for pure touch and put

00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:48,559
even though it is available but but yeah

00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:51,499
the the interface is it's fully touch

00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,729
enabled I think this is also if I

00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:55,190
understood the question they may be

00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:58,190
asking can you use it as a loss if you

00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:01,029
convert well connected to a liner and we

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,930
do exactly have better future that

00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:09,640
supports now

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:12,100
okay excellent um so speaking of a

00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,220
convergence mode dragon bites wondering

00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,360
what all triggers convergence mode so we

00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,000
talked a little bit about we know

00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,250
plugging in a monitor via HDMI will

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,300
trigger it can you can you manually

00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:25,540
trigger it is there any other way to

00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,870
sort of turn on convergence vote that's

00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:34,600
a logic behind behind that yes so they

00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:36,850
will there will be a manual toggle from

00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,760
directly from the from the interface

00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:44,610
that allow you to switch between

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,570
windowed mode and an touch mode

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,910
additionally to connect to your

00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:55,990
bluetooth mouse will also trigger that

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:57,280
switch as well okay um this question

00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,980
wondering about the app store for the

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,320
tablet is a burner phone when will it be

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,810
able to be viewed on a web browser so

00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:11,110
one more title to browse the web app

00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:12,310
store on my on my local PC sorry too

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,740
close they couldn't get that question

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:17,650
can have it again uh so currently the if

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:20,020
I want to view a application in the in

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,360
the app store for the phone I need to be

00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,010
running on a device like a phone or a

00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,420
tablet in order to view the app store I

00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:29,980
can't sit here now and use my pc and go

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,540
to ibero and see the app store so

00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,270
they're just wondering and when will

00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:37,660
might I be able to browse the app store

00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:43,060
online generic device not only 12 phone

00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:44,980
or tablet so I believe there is a

00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,860
catalog online it's not you know much

00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,260
about the others it there's actually one

00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,150
of the guys in the communities as a

00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,910
mirror that is available from a web

00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:57,430
browser we haven't actually completed

00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:00,070
the work ourselves to come offer that

00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:04,920
but it's already out there it seems to

00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:08,740
work quite well I don't have the URL in

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:13,710
its pretty discover Lee yeah I think it

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,710
says you i miss you up explorer com

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,920
rings Bell yeah yeah that's the thing

00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:21,950
yeah yeah that's does he actually or I

00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,600
you of explorer com that's the spot was

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:27,560
saying as the work of the of a community

00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,350
member that's Brian Brian two plus and

00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,510
he's been doing an awesome job at

00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:35,600
essentially making the store available

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:37,550
online which is pretty cool I mean I

00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,710
think that's a really nice example of

00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:43,460
where the community complements the work

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:51,500
that that canonical engineering teams

00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:53,990
might might be doing um alright so next

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,840
question you're wondering how would the

00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,180
phone apps are looking like on the on

00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,590
the tablet they want to know also if

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,330
they work well in other words are there

00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,450
any applications that you foresee will

00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,770
will translate well the tablet and in

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,700
general do they do they work whether

00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:15,080
they look good on the tablet yeah in

00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:19,910
terms of pure touch so the you know we

00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:23,030
have we have the ability within the DSD

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:26,180
Kate to recognize what display is

00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:28,340
required and provide some help with for

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,530
the application to make sure that it it

00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:36,260
scales correctly to display that's being

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:42,470
used there's is there's also the

00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:47,330
possibility to use the SDK in terms with

00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:51,200
a better environment to select certain

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:54,860
UI components that will mean that the

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,430
application adapts a little bit more

00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:03,890
smartly to when the application is used

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:07,790
on a phone or or a tablet so there are

00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,530
some levels of kind of automated dynamic

00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,570
support that we provide any way for when

00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:14,030
an application is used on a on a phone

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,850
or a moral oral tablets and there are

00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,590
some UI components and capabilities that

00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,200
are available within the SDK that a

00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:24,420
developer can use to purposefully access

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:29,670
knowing that can be used on either

00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:31,290
a phone or forex happening all right so

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,850
for those of those of you might have

00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:38,670
seen demos I know we showed them here

00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:41,190
before on QA showing as convergence

00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,860
demos were as the screen size which

00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,300
changes the application are scales and

00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,810
show you more interesting different

00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,430
views yeah I mean so the vanilla is

00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,870
another level to answer that question in

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,560
terms of whether or not how its

00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:59,400
represented in terms of a desktop

00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,380
application as well so there's again

00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,050
there are a number of components

00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,940
available that developers can use to

00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:11,510
ensure their app scales and adapts to

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:14,610
being used for the point of mouse input

00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:16,170
as opposed to as opposed to pure tub so

00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,330
these are all things that we thought

00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:21,750
about in terms of wanting applications

00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:24,840
to run as neatly and as well as possible

00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,820
on any type of device and there's a

00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:30,120
phone or a tablet or any type of display

00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:35,150
with a not its cultural or obviously

00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:38,910
innovation all right uh let's keep going

00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,380
I think that one might be for you Chloe

00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,760
wolf a girl asks is there any update on

00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,100
the messenger app that gives plug-in

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,480
support for I am applications so

00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:51,750
presumably maybe doing something beyond

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,520
just SMS so I don't know if there's any

00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,930
any real update their other than of

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,880
course the you know we have that

00:47:54,930 --> 00:48:00,080
capability because of the telepathy back

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,300
end so we would like to see some other

00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,090
backends integrated for example telegram

00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,190
and some others but there's nothing

00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:13,110
imminent there but there are there are

00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:14,400
plans for the future all right um this

00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:17,280
questions kind of for both you guys

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,780
sponge wants to know um yes have you

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,310
both satisfied that the tablet doesn't

00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,570
come with a sim card slot in other words

00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:28,020
is this something that you thought about

00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:29,640
or that's really the you know eq's

00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,890
decision which product they like to

00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:36,620
offer and we will you know we're going

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,960
to see this convergence feature

00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,590
on other devices you know in the future

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,490
so some of those will have sim cards

00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:48,200
there you go um clima fergo asked what

00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,540
size the tablet need to be for desktop

00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,840
mode to occur which is there any

00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:57,410
restrictions on on desktop mode now

00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,790
there's no restrictions okay for what

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,010
it's worth I'm you can do it on the on

00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,360
the nexus for today right so it may be a

00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:06,890
little bit difficult to use but you can

00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:09,200
certainly do it right I suppose the only

00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:12,590
limitation is your eyes right right it's

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,680
in the times of your finger the size of

00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:20,330
your finger it's figa sizing your finger

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:22,880
with the tablet support styluses it does

00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:24,380
not it's a I don't believe that does

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,230
Richard you get correct me I'm sure it's

00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:32,660
a capacitive screen yeah that's right

00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:34,610
yeah it does um next question will this

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,890
tablet be viable of my local currys pc

00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:40,760
world in other words they want to know

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:44,030
about retail presence well reach our

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,360
presence at this stage is gonna what

00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:52,600
from launch is directly from vco so it's

00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:55,520
it's an online distribution model okay

00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,190
um last question is talking about

00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,750
porting so obviously we've had a break

00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:01,760
dad for phones for a while and we've had

00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,160
some rather successful community ports

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,930
actually is there any plans for

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:16,700
community boards for tablets um I was

00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:18,380
seen any parents um we've I'm just

00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:25,720
thinking uh no i have ever seen anything

00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:25,720
specific i did see a thread regarding

00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:33,170
his own easy product but i can't i can't

00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,790
honestly share if that's something

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,720
that's got got real traction at the

00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:40,910
moment but there's no reason at all why

00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,310
we within the community and what we do

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,290
can't focus on another tablet products

00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,840
but

00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:50,050
but I haven't seen anything specific

00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,900
that I can try but I can share

00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,030
unfortunately I think what I would what

00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,130
I would say is well and browse bounce

00:50:55,030 --> 00:51:00,340
the question back to the person who asks

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:02,530
is that essentially there is nothing if

00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,930
there's someone who wants to do / tablet

00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:07,330
part there's nothing stopping them I

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:11,080
mean but in reality the challenges that

00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:13,480
up until now and we didn't have a retail

00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:17,200
product with with the tablet interface I

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:20,140
think once the one cm10 is Anthony's out

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,730
this this will be this can be used as a

00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,980
reference as well for doing any any

00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:27,310
community ports I mean ports are always

00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:31,750
subject to how which we charter is

00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:34,150
available but in any case I think if

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,860
there's a in same way that we do with

00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:40,090
the phone if there's a tablet that can

00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:42,070
run cyanogenmod mm where we can part 12

00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:44,800
I think the community should be able to

00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:47,440
to look at ways of porting I wanted to

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,990
that article yeah and as I was like

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:53,530
before when our SDK is going to be

00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:56,350
enriched with particular things that

00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:58,390
allow that kind of that kind of device

00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,130
to run ability so there's there's more

00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:06,340
help out there to help people they want

00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:08,920
to do this kind of all right um next

00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,570
question is wondering now that there's a

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,180
convergence tablet will be more effort

00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,980
in click affianced amplifying by using

00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:18,550
desktop applications in other words will

00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,440
we see convergence you know sort of you

00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:23,130
move forward and push forward by by

00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,720
actually having a convergence device

00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:30,160
very much so yeah that's absolutely

00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,600
where we're moving forward doesn't know

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,490
if you do the reference points to answer

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,750
that part it's other than the fact it's

00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:43,240
and in fact say yes that's really going

00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:46,390
on I agree the Eric yes um declan's is

00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:49,630
asking about firewalls of asking about

00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:52,630
the UFP firewall be over all the tablet

00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,830
again presumably you have you have the

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,110
command line available you have the full

00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,980
archives to the archives you can install

00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,560
it

00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,330
so funny yeah I mean it's a usual caveat

00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,720
that if you'd install it in the system

00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:08,140
image side your updates I don't wipe it

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:11,980
out if your install it in the visiting

00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:15,850
the home for the x apps and I think it

00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:17,740
can work for real edit drive that yeah I

00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:21,130
suppose the only limitation on

00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:23,380
installing it on that side is having

00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:26,190
access to this model stock right yeah

00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:29,609
but I think that's um there's been some

00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,720
blogs about doing things now they resume

00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:36,070
have your through the Imperial you

00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:39,520
archive in there all right we've got

00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:42,220
about five minutes left think with good

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,130
bunch of questions to nothing should be

00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:48,790
one or two and n go with them I think

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:51,040
I'm starting I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:53,410
and pick cover loved ones myself I mean

00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,240
some of them are have been answered

00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:59,530
further two other ones that we've been

00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:04,540
we've been discussing so I'm fine anyway

00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:06,760
um guest 3 4 5 is asking will be Q and

00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:12,790
major phones get the ability to run x

00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:15,880
applications in future updates so that

00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:20,380
that's well it is a hardware

00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:23,440
requirements so the existing phones that

00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:25,390
are out there right now so for

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,770
exceptional convergence feature the

00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:32,170
convergence features dependent on

00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:34,840
fundamentally the ability to connect the

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,850
phone to a monitor and use HTML those

00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,700
pieces of existing phones they don't how

00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:41,650
I capability right now in the future any

00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:45,780
of them to phone that has the ability to

00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:48,010
HDMI support can have converged us

00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,990
there's no issue with in running on a

00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,940
lot on that hardware but I can't

00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,760
currently those particular devices don't

00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:57,810
support the convergence features so

00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,810
that's another right

00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:03,750
the next the next question from speech

00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:08,230
is house updating the pre-installed apps

the tablet if they are not in the store

00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:20,140

00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:28,780
updated with how would you mind

00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:31,000
repeating that I think sorry the system

00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:37,990
update system image updater is going to

00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:39,430
take care of that a shorter okay doing

00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,890
that question with another question from

00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:45,940
sponge what are the bronze will be

00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:52,630
getting Fuji 25g on the phones farther

00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:53,500
for the American educate so what sorry

00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,190
what is the problem about getting

00:55:53,500 --> 00:56:00,190
support of the yes I'm just happy or

00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:02,230
American or the US market support he's

00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,520
wondering if it's you know if we're

00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,890
concerned that we've missed an

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,810
opportunity and is there a way basically

00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:12,580
he can enjoy a a device here in the US

00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,920
well the you know both the big Q amazing

00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:17,740
films that have all the devices will run

00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:21,790
in the US we just don't have a US

00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:24,040
carrier or none of the OEMs have decided

00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:32,500
to offer it in the US yet but the phones

00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:36,880
will work in the US yeah he's he's just

00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,950
lamenting the lack of of LTE basically

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,020
support which is which is kind of a

00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,690
hardware that that's a I suppose a

00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:50,250
complicated although the mx4 you know

00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:53,710
world's quite fast hear us yes does have

00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:57,190
all right so next question I'm going to

00:56:53,710 --> 00:57:00,580
be one that's been asked recently from a

00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:02,980
che is there a chances will get an x86 t

00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,859
stroke of the u.s. that will be on the n

00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,930
10 I think the question is rather like

00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:08,670
will we get to classic running on the

00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:15,099
antenna

00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:17,410
yet if the problem that the real oh the

00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,969
key to the whole support story and the

00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,749
convergence feature is the fact that

00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:25,239
unity 8 can do this single unit e 8

00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:28,869
input on that just beats the tap

00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:32,759
tightness or on base level in window

00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:32,759
mode and nothing else can do that

00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:46,119
alright so I think with your time for

00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:55,359
yet another question um let me see we've

00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:57,729
got some good ones here well I think

00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,019
that's not this is an ID 120 to wrap up

00:57:57,729 --> 00:58:01,749
so we've been talking about do you want

00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:04,839
to online summit coming up in from the

00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:08,099
3rd to the 5th off of main which we've

00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:10,599
just literally started planning today

00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:13,420
given to the skin will this week will we

00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:18,640
see either pass or richer that the next

00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:20,319
one tone and summit well speaking for

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,369
myself I do participate in the online

00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:28,719
service and they have been to the last

00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:31,599
several so i will probably be there I'm

00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,999
very happy to attend I think given

00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,529
anything else would be making about some

00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:37,299
convergence products is probably going

00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:39,369
to be a very valid reason for me to be

00:58:37,299 --> 00:58:44,019
there so wrong so yeah I'll certainly

00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:46,739
make myself available excellent nothing

00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:50,349
with this we can wrap you up for today

00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:51,849
