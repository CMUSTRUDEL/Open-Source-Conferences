you stay up to date on all the all the

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,850
sessions to them on google for their

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,780
ride last week was a little bit

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,540
different we had a whole bunch of ubuntu

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,590
online summit sessions that went for

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,570
three days from Tuesday to Thursday and

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,030
I wanted to like while we wait for

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,150
people to arrive and like think of their

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,720
amusing interesting questions I thought

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,729
I'd maybe mention a couple that might be

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,189
worth other people going back and

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,220
looking at because it was what something

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:36,630
like 70 sessions and you know you have

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,640
to pick out a good once i personally the

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,920
ones i'm most interested in going to use

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,689
the ones that i have you know less

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,479
visibility or i'm gonna have a look

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,030
through the cloudy so very kind of ones

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,610
especially stuff anything related to

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,530
snappy or anything like that because you

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,570
know it's it's not something i'd work

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,490
with every day so i want to be able to

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,630
pick up some some knowledge from some of

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,750
those but to the ones that that i was in

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,490
that i found super interesting

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,560
personally one was the session about

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,129
deco because that's going to be the

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,050
default email client in in a bun to

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,420
phone soon

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,120
and we took a little bit about some of

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,860
the outstanding tasks and I just wanted

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,990
to mention it partly because it was it

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,340
was really enjoyable to have a chat with

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,900
Dan who's the lead developer of deco and

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,970
James who works on the design team and

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,020
there's a lot of our usual interface

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:37,620
stuff I wanted to use this as a way of

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,860
like putting a call out to anyone who's

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,810
interested in getting involved dekho is

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,570
a good is a good way to get involved for

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,390
a number of reasons it's a it's a

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,760
high-profile application as a lot of

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,730
eyeballs on it a lot of users already

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,050
using it so therefore they find a bunch

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,970
of bugs it's working on something that

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,310
has a really good lead developer who's

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,080
really attentive and you know response

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,150
to your questions so if you you know if

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,310
you need help Dan's really good at being

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,560
there to to respond to that and they've

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,400
got a an IRC channel hash deco on

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,530
freenode and we've got a design team who

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,120
respond to your design questions well we

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,820
regularly catch up with them every week

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,440
but also because it's it's got a number

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,660
of technologies that you might be

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,880
interesting to a bunch of people you

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,670
know the usual email related stuff like

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,250
I'm app and smtp and stuff but also it

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,930
touches online accounts so there's a bit

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,450
of online account stuff in there which

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,040
is you know interesting to those who who

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,510
want to maybe create their own online

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,360
account to plug in for some other

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,600
platform but also the UI is done in qml

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,190
and there's back end in c++ so you know

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,989
there's a lot of different technologies

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,890
in there that that might be interesting

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,560
to people especially as CEO email is an

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,150
app that lots of people use every day so

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,209
it could be interesting and the other

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,310
one I wanted to mention was we had a

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,480
kind of design roundtable with their

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,150
myself James and Kevin Vader and Keven

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,160
showed off a couple of the tools that

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,470
he's got on github for designing

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,810
applications and I think it's it's worth

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,150
having a look at those because they're

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,639
really good if you want to

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,229
create mockups of apps for a buncha

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,690
phone he's got a nice inkscape tool that

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:33,660
was built on something that another

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,850
another designer Lucas had created

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,750
previously he's updated it for the new

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,100
look and feel of a new phone and you can

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,440
like drag and drop all the components

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,610
into various places and mock up where

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,139
you'll scream might look like really

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,419
good if you're a designer and not a

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,070
developer and to mock up or you want

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,199
your application to look like it's

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,880
really quite cool and he also had

00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,520
something that I've not seen before

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,610
which was these print out sheets where

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,560
you you open the thing up in inkscape

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,010
and then print out niet a4 or letter

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,930
size page which is actual size for the

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,120
phone so you can like you know scribble

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,310
with a you know old school pen and

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,080
pencil of what your user interface might

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,810
look like or you know design a game or

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,639
whatever directly on on paper which I

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,440
thought was really quite cool as well so

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,960
hello yourself Daniel were there any

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,800
interesting topics that give it to you

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:29,389
wanna mention sure and yeah I basically

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,919
went to all the stepping sessions cause

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:37,020
and it was it was really interesting and

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,949
some of the sessions were more more

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:45,510
technical nature for example we talked

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:50,130
about frameworks so framework snaps are

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:52,800
a way how you can share functionality in

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,659
a snappy system with multiple apps for

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,750
example you would have like a like a

00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:02,280
bluetooth framework or something or a

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,849
bluetooth was one of the examples which

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,099
came up and they are very very close to

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,340
landing the bluetooth framework in the

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:14,039
store next up is going to be a

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,740
connectivity framework which is going to

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,630
be based on network manager so it's

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,220
really nice to see that more and more of

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,300
these frameworks find their way into

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:28,169
this door and the great thing is that no

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,880
matter which device or which vm you're

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,340
going to be on all of them are going to

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,900
benefit from these frameworks so bring

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,770
the functionality once to the store

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,310
every

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:41,879
one can use them just you okay with the

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,289
the tutorial the snap craft and snappy

00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,389
tutorial and there was a section in

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,220
there about about frameworks and you do

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,900
a snap be installed darker and darker it

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,030
turns out is a framework on that whole

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,069
internet be so once you've got the

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,560
docker framework on you can put near

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,639
docker images on their and your

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,229
application is deployed by doc I thought

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,180
that was really quite cool and that that

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,129
that kind of cemented for me what a

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,409
framework was all about actually it was

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:06,930
it's like oh ok yeah that makes sense

00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:10,889
now we know there was lots of other

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:14,490
discussion as well because the framework

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,930
is like a big hammer and like what you

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,090
looking at the nail and you have a big

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,759
Hemi you tried to solve it that way so

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,710
people were asking like it can I shoot

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,020
my libraries in a framework how does it

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,030
all work and it was just interesting to

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,130
see how how everyone tries to figure out

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,419
how do I make use of this how hoes is

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:38,460
going to work for me and we had another

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:40,560
session which was about a plan for how

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:46,830
we can bring the phone and the desktop

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:51,120
to a snappy system and really yeah so I

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:55,770
like it was like ooh and Kyle was sorry

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,349
something look at it for his last name

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,300
and they did some analysis like they

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,979
figured out like what other gates we

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,810
would need to change and in which order

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:08,250
and how do we get from here to there

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:11,580
which compatibility layer we're going to

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,099
keep so on and that was also very nice

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,710
because the snappy folks they they were

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,219
listening and paying attention to what

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:25,529
the needs are going to be so um it was

00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:27,960
nice as well and we had a bunch sorry I

00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,909
was muted for me and that's some way off

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,889
isn't it the the movement of the phone

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,839
too snappy it's not it's not happening

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:41,430
in the in the short term is it not a

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:44,099
next few weeks yes yeah we had a bunch

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:48,270
of demo sessions as well we had Ted

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,310
showing off the captain plugin

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,040
catkin is to build tool used by the ross

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,530
community what's really nice is that the

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,140
most community who specialized in

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,240
building robots and n and making

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,950
machines and everything they all use it

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,060
they're all working with ubuntu already

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,890
so that's very nice already and if

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,370
they've got a lot of feedback how how

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,860
they cook how step craft could be more

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,470
tailored towards all these robot apps

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,200
which which currently exists and it's

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:24,120
going to be nice there you can basically

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,970
get them very easily it's all nice yeah

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:32,550
I look forward to our snappy powered

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:33,930
robot overlords yes yeah it's quite cool

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,630
it's it's great because you hear about

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,190
these things and I ear that the the raw

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,080
stuff the robot arrest stuff is

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,330
completely out of my visibility I don't

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't know you know robots just like

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,140
not something i get to see and so when

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,730
you hear about this development it's

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,900
quite exciting especially when you hear

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,310
that they're actually using able to

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:56,190
already it's a is really quite cool it

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,600
was just thinking about booked you on on

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:04,230
fridges and drones and elsewhere and

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,110
yeah to be everywhere yeah lots of other

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,960
snappy stuff and and and one was also

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:15,600
nice was to see jane do a Q&A as well

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:18,780
hmm it was brilliant yeah like if you

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,970
like lots of time to kill go to summit

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,880
on ubuntu com all the sessions were

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,160
recorded so you can say look at them

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,960
yeah actually i was chatting to a couple

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,300
of friends on online the other day and

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,970
they were saying they like having the

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,000
videos playing on a on a second screen

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,310
while they're working so they can make

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,440
and carry on working and and i just have

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,300
the videos background noise you don't

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,370
have to like constantly pay attention to

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,470
them and then when something interesting

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,390
you know triggers yeah you can like

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,760
rewind in there and really listen to

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,310
that bit is sir that's quite cool and

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,920
yet they're all archived so you can

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,780
watch them anytime anywhere on youtube

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,570
if you know of anyone who actually has a

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,540
problem getting access to them we'd be

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,399
happy to make them ave

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,139
little by some other means I know some

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,440
in some places youtube is blocked or

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,449
difficult to access but yeah if there

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,000
are there any specific videos i'm happy

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:14,589
to download them from youtube and

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,240
reupload them somewhere else because

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,430
they're all like you know Creative

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,230
Commons licensed we don't we don't

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,259
restrict redistribution of those videos

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,209
that are on the the Ventura on air or

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,370
the YouTube developer channels just like

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,690
in it grab a memory share them or you

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,519
there someone else can grab them and

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,930
reshare them if they want the you don't

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:37,480
have to wait for me to do Oh actually

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,319
yeah driving some questions yes I think

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:45,720
each other and I think the first one was

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:49,120
fun put in when wounding phone in Russia

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,339
I just took into my Google+ feed and

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,199
there were at least two or three people

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:59,560
mentioning that it was going to be next

00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:03,160
week so yeah there you go ah it's a 17th

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:07,029
of november i think and i only know this

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,709
because i've also seen it google+ it's

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:16,329
not yeah we we don't add that's yeah i'm

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:20,440
seeing and it's the bqe five is

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:24,610
launching in russia in ya next week so

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,240
that's good uses man brilliant and

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,430
there's a bunch of folks you didn't use

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,170
question and kept letters in front of

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,350
that question but i'm going to pick them

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,420
up anyway and any pending agreements

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:41,889
with us carrier to exploring for booty

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,290
phone sprint t-mobile and yet these are

00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:47,620
announcements that are very likely going

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:52,810
to be done by other carriers themselves

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:56,230
and we're doing the software so I icon

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,790
and now yeah that question comes up

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,180
quite a lot and it was asked last week

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,180
at us and I think Jane Jane answered

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,060
that one directly but yeah we you know

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,350
ah oui we don't have visibility of those

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,610
kind of that kind of information and but

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,200
the

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:20,589
the general feedback is those

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:23,560
discussions are ongoing now the question

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:28,029
from salil how can I contribute to go to

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,329
community the good news is we devoted an

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:34,930
entire website just for this question if

00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:37,870
you go to community w to calm and you

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,720
should very easily get inside interview

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,940
to various branches of you good

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
community and just find out what might

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,529
interest you and how to get in touch

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,019
with if the folks there makes funny this

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,750
we we have that we have that term will

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,490
find a task le cheese' it's a good like

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,380
you know a set of steps you can

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,769
questions you can answer to figure out

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,079
you know how how you could contribute

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,250
your run to visit it's bizarre cuz you

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,899
know thinking about it if you take a

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,050
step back and look at that find a task

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:10,480
it's it's a very prescribed set of

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,490
things that you know we would like

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,600
people to contribute in a bun to like

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,490
you know documentation translations

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,380
coding bug triaging new there they're

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,620
the same things we've we've wanted

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,779
people to contribute to for ya eleven

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,730
years now and you know people do

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,980
contribute in all those areas but then

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,430
there are places outside of that that

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,079
you may have skills in which is not

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,029
listed on that website and if you've got

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,760
a particular skill you think we might

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,649
you know benefit from you doing

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,779
something then by all means get in touch

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,390
and say hey I can do this would you be

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,519
interested so don't feel like if it's

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,709
not listed on the community website we

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:54,399
don't want it that's not the case so let

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,899
me give you a couple of examples um out

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,930
of the blue sometimes we see people

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:01,899
creating little promo videos like you

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,329
know ten seconds something nicely

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:07,570
animated in blender with a couple of

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:09,790
logos and maybe a screenshot or two and

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,949
it looks really cool and most of us who

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,690
work at canonical either don't have the

00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,300
skills or don't have the time to learn

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,920
to get the skills to do it or we just

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,089
don't have the creativity in the spark

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,160
where is someone out there in the

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,529
community who has the time and this then

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,070
the blender skills to do it great knock

00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:28,910
yourself out go for it

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:31,400
or if you're you know particularly good

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,700
at icon design or something maybe there

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:38,330
are community applications that that

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,970
need a new icon designed or you know or

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,710
a revamp in some other way maybe you're

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,570
really good with color schemes or

00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,100
something you know picking better color

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,770
schemes for apps that kind of stuff so

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,870
don't don't feel like community da Vinci

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,400
calm is these are the ways you must

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,950
contribute to a bun to and nothing

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,570
outside this box you can get that where

00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,640
we welcome all kinds of contributions

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,920
and sometimes we discover people who are

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,340
contributing to a bunting in ways we not

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,890
even thought of were you know ways that

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:17,270
you could contribute and yeah we welcome

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:22,160
them all cool okay I what's the next

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:24,950
question was yeah custom from s0 ah on

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,320
the what's new in 1510 statement there

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,330
was unity a preview I upgraded yet no

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,740
unity aids didn't make it to movies

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:37,160
candidate you might have to install the

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,760
packet all again there is a there's a

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,230
few unity eight packages that you can

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,550
install the unity eight sessions in

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,780
there and then there's a couple of

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,660
others which let you log out and log

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,610
back in under a unity a yeah i think

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,400
it's called unity a desktop session or

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,370
something right right so the fact that

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,360
the the release notes say well Daniel

00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,190
goes and finds the name of the package

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,790
the fact that the release notes say

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,520
unity eight is either is is available

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,439
and that might mean it's in the archive

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,939
yeah we've packaged it up and we've got

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,920
it working and it's in the archive and

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,930
it's available for you to install we

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,900
don't necessarily put everything on the

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,400
CD or on the ISO or if you upgrade you

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,589
don't necessarily get all that extra

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,720
stuff thrown in because you know might

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:24,380
not want it I mean it takes up this

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,150
space and you know it's not one hundred

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,110
percent ready yet so that's why it's a

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:33,220
pre d yeah the pic is called unity ate

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,100
their desktop their session dish meal

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,590
cool I'm

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,840
some caveats it doesn't work on every

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,080
video card so you're going to have a

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,370
happier time doing this on an all intel

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,200
machine or on an nvidia machine where

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,690
you're using the nuvo drive at the open

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,510
source new go driver I don't think it

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,880
yet works with the nvidia binary driver

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,410
I know nothing about AMD I'm sure

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,990
someone in the IRC channel can mention

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,440
whether it works with AMD cards I just

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:07,820
don't know I don't have any AMD kit

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,039
sorry okay next question is from

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,929
nightmare he says the Linux community

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,580
gives canonical in a bun to a lot of

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,169
stick about their involvement or lack

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,450
thereof in the development of mimics

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:20,100
what innovations or technologies has

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,960
when she used from other projects

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,179
recently I'm not sure I understand that

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,970
like I mean they're one way to answer if

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:34,340
you have a look at just the number of

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:37,559
packages in ubuntu it's like 30 or

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:42,570
40,000 that should give you an idea of

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:45,240
how many projects were adopted by by a

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,580
good too I mean what would you always

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,330
that's at least how I read the question

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,820
but would you always did was supposed to

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,650
integrate the best of of open source

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,260
software and make it available and

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,630
that's what we've been doing since that

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:06,059
year based on the great work of Debian

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:08,130
who do the same thing so I think it's

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,480
very hard to mention even the most

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:15,120
important ones it's just right and and

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,700
you know I I could I could pick off like

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,900
two or three for example on the phone

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,210
that are different from the ones that

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,320
are on desktop which is different from

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,360
those that are on the server so I'll

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,000
give you an example from each right we

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,799
contribute too cute upstream on the

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,110
phone we contribute to a genome on the

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:43,110
desktop and things like alexion lxd on

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,299
the server in the future all of those

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,690
will be everywhere but you know if you

00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,720
think of those separations

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:53,220
now so yeah there is some contribution

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:58,030
but I tend not to get too worried about

00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:00,250
the negative things people say next

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,260
question is from a pucker or pooka I

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,510
don't know how you pronounce that he

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,300
says i just installed ubuntu on my

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,760
virtual box the main OS is windows 10

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,430
it's my first time to see linux OS some

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,970
tips to learn what is terminal what do i

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:18,760
do with it ah that's good question ah

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,210
you know it's it's funny when someone is

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:27,310
like new to linux and says what should i

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:30,690
do i'm new to it you know my part of

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:33,400
part of me thinks it was a long time ago

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,040
that I was new to linux and i'm trying

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,050
to think back you know what what you

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,290
know what i was excited by the terminal

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,510
let back then like in it 12 years ago or

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,250
however long it was i was excited by the

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,980
terminal i was excited about things like

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,140
being able to remotely run programs

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,410
using you know remote x or something

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,510
like VNC or whatever at the time and and

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,570
that kind of stuff I found exciting and

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,090
then and then it moved on to actually

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,820
can I use this thing and I think that is

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,070
the is the is the best thing to do is to

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,830
just use it not I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,020
you know a lot of a lot of type of

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,130
people like say here are the best 10

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,500
things to do after you've installed

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,060
linux or these are the tests 10 best

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,070
things you should check out on linux i

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,450
would say just do what you normally do

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,940
you know whatever it is you normally use

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,250
your Windows machine for try doing that

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,260
on a Linux machine rather than try and

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,300
orchestrate some scenario work that you

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,300
might do on Linux just do what you

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,700
normally do so you know on on my Windows

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,340
machine I used to play a lot of games

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,680
and now a lot of those i can now play or

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,450
linux so you know I now have steam on

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,320
both so i can play those games are on

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,330
steam in my spare time i make silly

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,430
little computer games and some of that I

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,530
did on windows with windows tools and

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:53,250
now there are tools on Linux that let me

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,860
do that like unity 3d and G develop and

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:59,290
God oh and loads of others so really

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,490
it's up to you it's not it's not

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,620
something that anyone else can

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,710
so you should do this with them I just

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,429
think do ever you do with a computer

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:12,280
personally what do you think Daniel you

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:14,530
know it's just looking on the ubuntu and

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,890
accepts the east side for a tour or

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:20,500
something and the tool exists you can

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,809
just look it up and see if you get some

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,330
inspiration that way but basically what

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,210
hope you said but if you really try to

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,450
to use it like I don't know write a

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,360
letter and print it out and and I don't

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,830
know go to your favorite websites and

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,370
then make all the stuff work you

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,679
normally do you can be very easily going

00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:45,940
to learn like this is the way I would do

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,460
it on on on kubuntu and that's it and a

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,260
great thing is that that to do and all

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,570
the other flavors of Hulu do they come

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,150
with a great community so if you should

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:58,270
should run into problems you will find

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,679
somebody to talk to very easily and the

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,690
really handy thing about doing it in

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,340
virtualbox on your windows install is

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,620
that you don't mess up your windows

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,780
install so it's not anything is going to

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,429
be a catastrophe and you with virtualbox

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,660
you can take a snapshot of what the

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,210
system looks like so you can do your

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,010
install do your updates then take a

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,050
snapshot and then you can muck about

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,809
with it as to your heart's content and

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,820
if you mess it up you can just revert in

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:24,220
virtualbox back to the previous snapshot

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:28,590
and your system suddenly starts working

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:31,270
again and so yeah it's yeah he can

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,860
basically break it if you really want to

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,750
you know all those things about what

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,370
happens if i run this command you don't

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,080
have to feel worried about because it's

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,390
not your main machine it is in a virtual

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,280
box yeah maybe in the future once you've

00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,870
paid with it get a lot more you feel

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,270
more confident maybe you'll migrate your

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,540
main machine or a second laptop or

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:53,010
something like that across but yeah just

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,010
use it how you would normally use it

00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,380
pull another question from put in are

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,990
the installed apps on the buncher with

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:15,290
no session when click install install

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:18,300
not installing ah so yeah that's tricky

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:21,780
you have to set up the Ubuntu one

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,400
account or what a little room well the

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,800
question how you install apps on Apple

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,750
to with a mere session so that's

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:33,900
assuming unity Aten mere there is there

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,900
is an app store and in that app store

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,290
there are a small number of applications

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,700
and because the the the App Store is

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,910
mostly focused on the phone at the

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:50,340
moment most of them are phone related

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:53,540
apps and many of them are built for the

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,090
phone chipset arm hf and not built for

00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,180
desktop chipsets like Intel and AMD x86

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,280
compatible and so if you look in the

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,130
store on a desktop running unity 8 in

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,930
there if you open the app scope and open

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,670
the store and sign in with your blond to

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,800
one account you might actually find this

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,610
very even smaller number of apps

00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,200
available for you to use and if there's

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,410
anything particular you do need which

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,020
are on the phone we can maybe make a

00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,370
desktop build available in the store

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,540
that's that's certainly possible we've

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,120
done that with some of the apps so for

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,090
example the file manager there's a mhf

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,910
and an AMD 64 bill from the command line

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:37,320
you can use you should be able to use PK

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:40,740
con to install apps we generally don't

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,350
install apps using click directly use PK

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,440
con install local allow untrusted and

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:48,090
then the name of the cliq package that's

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,330
the way I do it anyway I wouldn't I

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,250
wouldn't use click to install but I have

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,500
seen some bugs about not being able to

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:00,720
install click on the desktop and I think

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,100
those are a Palmer related so um yeah it

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,700
could just be a bug that you're

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,700
experiencing

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,520
ok

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,929
if law us have any future tablets that

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,120
lend themselves to running into personal

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:19,440
but it's something that could have a

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,440
compatibility list installation guide

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:28,870
yeah it I keep my eye out for intel

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:32,110
based tablets as well I I have one on my

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:37,240
desk right here and I would love to be

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:39,460
able to install ubuntu on there and part

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,809
of the problem is it's difficult getting

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,030
past the fact that they need to be

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,730
routed and you know depending upon what

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,700
I rest is already on them I'm led to

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,490
believe that ones that run Android out

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,200
of the box are generally harder Intel

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:58,360
tablets that run Android out the box are

00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:02,490
harder to get non android OS is running

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,410
on them whereas windows-based tablets

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:10,200
like some of the dells and some others

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:13,419
some of the cheaper ones are more easily

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,070
coerced into booting ubuntu that you can

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:17,080
install oven too but then there's still

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:23,980
issues of you know Wi-Fi drivers and

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:27,070
stuff like that um so yeah I don't have

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:30,610
a good answer for you there and I would

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,830
like for it to be possible to just have

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,710
a USB stick that you could boot on an

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,030
Intel tablet and you know and go and

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,940
actually that would be that would be

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,790
really quite cool I know Jenna will cook

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,429
has one and while you answer the next

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,309
question I'll ping will and find out

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,610
what Intel tablet he has and then tell

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:53,290
you what it is you're thinking and

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:59,890
another option would be like more and

00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:01,720
more laptops have touch capabilities so

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,360
if you have one of those lying around or

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,600
coming easily install a recent version

00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,240
of ubuntu on it and have 58 running

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,490
there is also a good way to to test

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,490
things yeah

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,970
another question from food chain what is

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,550
the difference between stable RC

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:27,440
proposed and devil Jenna and how to

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:31,130
change channel and basically the

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:35,720
channels are there for what their names

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:40,280
say so the release team tries to to only

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:43,910
put stable jane channel stable changes

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:51,590
to the stable channel and the other

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:54,860
changes have less less QA steps before

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:59,180
them so I see proposed is what what

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:02,360
lands after our other automated tests

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,970
have been run but as far as I know they

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,150
don't have all the manual tests run by

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,220
their QA teams that right someday I

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:13,670
actually yeah they do some of them do

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,470
require manual testing so they do they

00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,880
do go through QA so yes so we have a

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,440
stable channel so if you went out and

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,720
bought and a buncha phone right now it

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,400
will be on the stable channel and you

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,490
would get an update every six weeks or

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:31,630
thereabouts-- if you were to change

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,630
channel and switch to the RC proposed

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,500
then RT proposed means Artemis release

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,730
candidate and proposed means you know

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,010
somewhere it's a proposed image that may

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,630
become a stable image in the future and

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,900
we crank one of those out every day

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:54,770
sometimes twice a day often not at

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:58,040
weekends and those images contain all

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:01,730
the things that landed since the last

00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,590
image so for example last Friday there

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,240
was a bunch of updates to a number of

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,610
things like the system settings was

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,280
updated you see eight was updated and

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,740
Mia was updated so those things had bug

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,190
fixes and new features land those things

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:20,480
go into either the main oven to archive

00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:23,600
or a PPA and then though the archive and

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,750
the PPA consumed in the creation of a

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,920
new image for the phone and so if you're

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,680
running

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,420
phone with the RC proposed channel then

00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,750
overnight when that image is finished

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,700
being made you get a little notification

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:44,360
that says there's a new system update

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,670
available and you tap the button and you

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,550
get a new update and that happens every

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,710
day sometimes twice a day with all the

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:55,610
things that are new since yesterday and

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:57,740
then after about six weeks we do a full

00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,840
round of testing on the whole image so

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,820
everything's tested as it lands so those

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,920
system settings a unity eight and miR

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,510
that were updated on Friday will have

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,780
been tested but then there's another

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:11,120
final round of testing before we say

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,910
that that image is good and that can go

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,860
out and that's where you see Lucas who

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,710
sends out his daily emails to the event

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,440
a feminist sends out an update that says

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,780
right we've we've pushed out an update

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,060
to the stable Channel and so those

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,040
people who've got a retail phone will

00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,410
then get the same kind of notification

00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,650
but they've got batched up all the

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,870
updates that happen in the six weeks I

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:42,020
care between it's a bit like running

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:44,480
ubuntu ubuntu release and then updating

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,370
it like six months later you know you

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,050
get all the updates that happened in the

00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,210
six months in between one release and

00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,880
the next right whereas if you stick on

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,740
the development release then you get all

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,740
the updates drip fed to you throughout

00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,680
that six-month period there is also a

00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,960
channel which is you which is based on

00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,460
Wiley or Xenia but we don't we don't

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,780
recommend anyone uses thats the only two

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,910
channels we generally recommend is

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:13,130
stable and the RC proposed yeah no just

00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:17,540
check the link on my I see if you go to

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:21,590
develop a boon to come start that device

00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:24,200
is the image channels and you feel good

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,530
to get a long explanation with along

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,870
with nicey-nice diagram and instructions

00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,960
file to change channels it's all on that

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,850
page and going back to net loss question

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,210
about Intel tablets I just pinged will

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,299
and he said the tablet he was using was

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,850
the acer aspire p3

00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:45,950
and you may have seen will cook is the

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,190
desktop team lead and he's made a few

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,559
videos if you find will cook on youtube

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,779
you'll find him and he's made a couple

00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,669
of videos about showing off unity a mere

00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:58,869
running on an Intel device and I think

00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:05,779
it was the acer aspire p3 he was using

00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:07,999
so we kind of know that word okay Booker

00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:10,399
has another question is it worse or

00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:12,320
better for a beginner on xubuntu 1404 I

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,809
have Python version 2.7 to updated

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:20,389
Python 3 our beginner and python is my

00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:22,460
first programming language so I think we

00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:25,009
should be available on 14 and for as

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:29,090
well you just might have to additionally

00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:33,940
install it if you want all your code to

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:37,009
be future future proof news typing food

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,730
just do it and we are planning to move

00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:42,259
to python 3 only in 1604 I mean we keep

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:47,389
saying that we're going to at some point

00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:50,590
but I think the plan was where you going

00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:53,929
to get it off the offer desktop image

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:56,989
right so that would be if you'd written

00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:58,820
some stuff in 1404 now and you'd based

00:33:56,989 --> 00:34:01,429
it around Python 227 and then you

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,320
upgraded to 1604 maybe your scripts need

00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:05,179
tweaking to make them work on 1604

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,220
because that's Python 3 by default but

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:09,230
probably Python 207 would be in the

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,559
archive still it just wouldn't be in the

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:15,139
Deaf dish the default image right yeah

00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,419
right because now it doesn't make sense

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:20,210
if you write new code for it not to be

00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:21,679
patently right I guess the only the only

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,270
thing is if you're following tutorials

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,940
or guides that were written for Python

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,659
toodles them so maybe try and find item

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:31,659
three equivalents to those guides yeah

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,659
good

00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,990
not when when will the would do phones

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,720
have the new kernel and new booty

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,730
version 1604 maybe so that's a good

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,080
question so there's two separate

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,990
questions a new kernel is is harder to

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,040
do bit easier to answer we're kind of

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:58,250
tied to the kernel that is required for

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,260
the Android drivers remember that while

00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,560
these things are running a bun too there

00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,230
is a container that has the android

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,550
drivers in it and for things like the

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,920
gps the Wi-Fi and your other sensors and

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:16,340
anything that needs a binary blob or a

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,860
and on a specific driver and we're kind

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,020
of tied to that kernel version so while

00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,110
we can back pull fixes and bug fixes and

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,500
security updates to that Colonel we

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,410
can't easily just say right on the beach

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,360
you let's go to linux kernel thought up

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,460
to we just can't do that because that

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,140
would mean trying to forward port a

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,030
whole bunch of stuff that probably won't

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,010
work when build against that can all

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,260
work with that Colonel so we're kind of

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:46,100
stuck so the sum of the devices are

00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:49,040
running kernel three of four I think and

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:54,020
some of them are running 3 10 but that's

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:57,020
what we got from the harbor been there

00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,230
so that would be a BQ orem or mesa

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:03,050
that's the colonel we got from them so

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:06,950
that's the kurma question the the are we

00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,020
going to update 1604 question so phones

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,300
are delivered on a different cadence

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,820
than the desktop so the desktop cadences

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,990
every six months as you know 1504 5010

00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:20,690
1604 phones come out and land like

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,330
interweaved with that that cycle they

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,970
don't they don't you know if we went to

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:28,940
meizu or BQ and said you what's the next

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,130
phone we're going to ship and and then

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:34,190
say to them let's ship it on you know

00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,980
April the 23rd when 1604 comes out or

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,180
whatever day it is that might not line

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,180
up with their marketing and their

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,920
manufacturing so you know we have to be

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,630
a bit more flexible about how what

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,750
software we deliver and when it has to

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,310
line up with our releases

00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,380
because it doesn't realign up with the

00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,240
desktop release at all really so what

00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,970
we've got on the phones at the moment is

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:59,640
actually vivid which is 1504 plus what's

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,340
called an overlay PPA and the overlay

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,950
PPA has all the new stuff that we can't

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,880
put in the vivid archive because vivid

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,720
is frozen when vivid came out so what

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
you've got on the phone is actually

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,470
built from 1504 plus a whole load of

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,250
packages that came after 1504 that came

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:22,110
in a PPA so we probably won't go to 1604

00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,870
we'll carry on doing that with vivid and

00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:29,430
the PPA and then sometime next year I

00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:31,140
expect we will move forward to adding it

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,090
with every 16 and for all or the next

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:38,600
release I don't know which not my

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:42,920
decision I hope that makes sense cool

00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,090
next question is from a bunch of fun de

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,040
when can we expect the first commercial

00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,590
Bunty phone that supports convergence

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,930
and who will be the partner you can

00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,810
expect that probably I think next year

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:57,090
and the partner is BQ we've already

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,920
announced that so we've already said the

00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:03,630
first partner for converge devices be

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,060
cute ooh yeah so if you want to test out

00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,160
the converge stuff you can go and pick

00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,690
up a secondhand Nexus 4 they let you

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,730
they're not currently sold at the moment

00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,370
but if you want to play with it and

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:17,580
develop on it or for it then go and get

00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:20,190
yourself a nexus 4 and we cranked out an

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,760
image every day and you'll find the

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:26,130
updates deliver new magical convergence

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,100
stuff all the time but if you wanna wait

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,790
for an actual device then yeah not this

00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,790
year next year

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,990
I'd met our house google phone sharing

00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:43,930
in China India has them in good adoption

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:46,089
um short answer I don't know I have no

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,680
idea of sales numbers I don't have any

00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,559
idea of sales numbers anywhere in the

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,859
world so singling out China or India is

00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,569
even harder because I don't know any um

00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:58,300
but I think there was a question about

00:38:55,569 --> 00:39:00,430
sales numbers that if you go back to

00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,599
jane's cue a and i think mark addressed

00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,280
this as well when people were talking

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,359
about you know i'll be okay with the

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,329
sales number stood at the moment ubuntu

00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,920
for phones is very much an enthusiastic

00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:17,230
lat former developer platform you know

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,270
we're not selling it in in retail

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,490
outlets in shops in the high street in

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,880
you know major Western countries where

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,530
people might walk in by the phone

00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,059
thinking you know i can use everything i

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,069
normally use on my current phone and

00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,780
then get disappointed and find out they

00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,790
can't ended up taking it back to the

00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,579
shop that will be a worse experience for

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,660
everybody involved you know the person

00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:39,700
who brought the phone would have a bad

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,030
experience the shop would hate us for

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,480
like you know them getting the returns

00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:49,059
we wouldn't like that and so you know

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,119
we're working slowly and we'll we'll get

00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:55,660
there we will get there but yeah I don't

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:58,390
think sales sales numbers or lack

00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:02,470
thereof are a massively important issue

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:08,650
for us right now yeah now just thinking

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:12,700
back to the previous online summit we

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:15,400
had a chat with the founder of PQ and he

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,040
said he was just generally super happy

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,650
with how everything went like the I can

00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,440
help people you see the phone was

00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,910
received the interaction with with the

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,430
bunch of community and everything else

00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:32,680
so I think that that's that's more

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,380
important than than numbers right now

00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,299
right and the fact that big you you know

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,609
came to us and said we want to do

00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:40,900
another phone and then came to us and

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:43,420
said they want to do a converged device

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,040
and now they're selling their phones in

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,220
india as well where they previously

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,720
weren't

00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,460
and next week they're gonna start

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,710
selling their phones in Russia where

00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,230
they previously weren't kind of tells a

00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:57,740
story to me that they're happy people so

00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:01,490
you know keeping them happy is way

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:06,349
better than us producing huge sales

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,720
numbers you know as long as the partners

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:16,540
happy and Mark and Jane are happy I'm

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:18,859
happy oh let's question is from Putin

00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:22,790
some people install apps on the phones

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:26,090
using apt-get is it safe if not is there

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,950
any safe way to use apt-get install well

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,730
it kind of depends on your definition of

00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,980
safe you know if you make your phone

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:36,920
read write and then you do at get

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,170
installed Tao say uh yeah it's not going

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,970
to burn your house down or you know eat

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,859
your cats or anything like that so it's

00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:47,540
relatively speaking on the grand scale

00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:51,290
of things is safe however we never test

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:53,839
that so we r QA only of a test the

00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:56,750
read-only image and the OTA updates and

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,820
the cliq packages we only ever test that

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,460
scenario so as soon as you make your

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,150
phone read write and apt-get install

00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,970
stuff you're going off-piste and going

00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,730
down a path that we never test and so if

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:14,000
it does fail like for example it pulls

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:16,780
in a package that you know causes the

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,670
phone no longer to boot or maybe

00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,230
installing one package causes loads of

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,210
other packages to be removed which

00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:26,180
causes it not to boot or you get no

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:30,500
display or something then you get to

00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,570
keep all the pieces and you can get out

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,990
of that problem by reflashing your phone

00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:39,200
so you can it's not like I've not heard

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,390
of anyone who has 41 of a better word

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,869
bricked their phone by doing this

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,580
they're mildly inconvenienced by doing

00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:50,180
this if it breaks and they have to

00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:52,880
reflash their phone and you know but

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,800
that's that's that's part of you know

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,540
going off-piste and doing something a

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,800
little bit crazy with your phone but it

00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,180
is your phone and if you want to do that

00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,180
knock yourself out

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:10,490
Andy Schumer asks is there a top-level

00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,180
cooperation support involving canonical

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,890
and Mycroft at you OS Ryan sipes sounded

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,090
hopeful that things would work out but

00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,770
he seems that canonical should be

00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,840
working hard to get such a promising AI

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:28,040
working on the phone and desktop as a

00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:32,510
first class system um so I think this is

00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,760
tricky because you know Ryan and the

00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:39,230
Mycroft guys are working hard to deliver

00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,849
a product to their customers and I think

00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,020
they would love to see the integration

00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:45,320
of some of the things that they've

00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,780
developed on urban to desktop but we

00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,030
also are busy developing things for our

00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:53,480
customers that's you know you bun to

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:57,380
users and over to phone purchases I'm

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,119
sure that we would accept appropriate

00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,010
contributions into the desktop if they

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,200
fit with our design and they fit with

00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,430
their coding standards and they can fit

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,119
in the archive then that would be

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,770
awesome I don't know that we have a huge

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,800
amount of resource that we could

00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,390
allocate to you know helping Mycroft I

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,700
know the microphase have spoken to

00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,500
people in canonical and you know I I

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:22,010
don't know that there's any more that we

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:25,130
could do really I'd love to hear from

00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,450
from from the microfiber is anything

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,130
more we can do it if they need any help

00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,359
you know we'll do what we can or if

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,030
there's community people you want to

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:43,280
help I'm sure they'd love that as well

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:45,589
ah next question is from Sally is there

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:50,000
any way I can run my applications or

00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:54,140
software from the terminal hmm need more

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,849
detail i think is that a phone related

00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:01,460
question um in which case yes I think

00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,869
you can I mean on desktop yet you're

00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,150
open a terminal you type the command and

00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:07,760
it works on the phone it's a little bit

00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,430
different there's a program called

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,130
ubuntu app lon

00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,839
and a 12 app launch can be used to

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,210
launch applications from the command

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,630
line it has a couple of command line

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,220
parameters one of them is the app ID and

00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:23,950
there's another parameter where you

00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,990
point to the desktop file so that it can

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,400
pick up the icon and other parameters

00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,050
from the desktop file but yeah I

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,130
wouldn't do app launch if you're doing

00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:35,710
this on the phone if the next question

00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,240
was a bit of a meteor question was how

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,030
we figured out if the question was

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,540
concerning use on the phone or use on

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:46,569
the desktop and we applied our best

00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,970
guess like if you want to we ask your

00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:55,210
question or get it re answered depending

00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:56,800
on the other use case bring it ah met

00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,450
nor asks have you considered asking

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,619
people to clarify that question that

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:05,170
word is that the one you just okay

00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:09,579
dragonbyte up how does or will canonical

00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:13,420
earn money with you with the phone mmm

00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:16,540
not my department I make free software

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,790
yeah I I I don't know but I would

00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,950
envisage similar waste away the ways in

00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,880
which other companies make money with

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:26,109
selling hardware devices with partners

00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,299
I'm sure you can use your imagination

00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:30,069
and figure that out but I personally

00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:34,480
don't know the details but I'd imagine

00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:37,720
is yeah but that was uncertain and I see

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,670
the same way oh good like what we what

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:44,020
we do with OEMs for example is that

00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:47,380
there's a to call a per-unit device see

00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:53,369
something and it's probably something

00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,369
similar yeah I'd imagine so yeah yeah

00:46:54,030 --> 00:47:01,720
okay next question I'm kind of lost now

00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:04,559
we're done with the first batch of

00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,559
questions

00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:29,359
but all of them yep we go home now I am

00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:31,550
home yeah yeah so you know you don't

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,369
have to save your questions up for this

00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,500
