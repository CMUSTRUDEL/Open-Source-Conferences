hello everyone welcome to the last

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,460
session of today's the bun to online

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,800
summit this one is going to be a Q&A

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,740
specifically about the convergence work

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,460
that's going on bringing the code bases

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,539
for ubuntu phone ubuntu tablet and about

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,920
to desktop all together in a single code

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,590
base that will work for all of those

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,810
form factors with me today I've got some

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,340
of the engineers and managers who are

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,900
going to be responsible for that work

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,390
and I'm going to let them introduce

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,110
themselves one at a time starting with

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,110
Kevin gun

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,530
they're a my name is Kevin gun and

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:49,010
actually in managing two teams managing

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:54,649
the mere team and the unity a team all

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:57,729
right next we've got Saavik hey this is

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:04,399
me how high saavikam RC I am actually

00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:07,729
managing dingy team under kevin and then

00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:11,530
finally we have will cook hello i will

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,530
and i managed to complete desktop

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:17,390
alright so the way this will work is

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,210
that we're in the hash ubuntu hyphen u

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,369
OS hyphen convergence IRC channel on

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,619
freenode that's where you will go to ask

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,119
all of your questions start them with

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,159
the word question and all capital

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,350
letters so that they turn bright yellow

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
for me and I don't miss them we will

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,610
answer them in the order they come in

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,479
until we run out of questions or we run

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,490
out of time whichever comes first

00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,490
alright we have one question already it

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,979
is from our friend Daniel Halbach he's

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,289
asking is something still missing to let

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:56,869
us install clicks in a unity 8 desktop

00:01:48,289 --> 00:02:01,179
session so we are good so yeah this is

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:03,890
absolutely had trouble with basically a

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:06,020
as far as I can understand a Miss

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,420
compatibility between package pitch Oh

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,120
point eight and one pointer which has

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,609
now been solved and these days yes you

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,570
should be able to install clicks on the

00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:19,940
on the on your desktop the only

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,310
requirement though is that those clicks

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,470
I do actually include binaries for the

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,989
architecture that you run on so if

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,799
you're you're probably running and the

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,959
64 on your on your laptop then the

00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,959
clicks that are uploaded the store have

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
to be multi arch which means that they

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,030
have to actually include binaries for

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,889
arm a check for the phone and for am 64

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,790
for your desktop and then they should

00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,950
show up

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,379
so that's actually Daniels next question

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:56,370
are we planning to use fat packages for

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:59,790
most of the apps soon well probably

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,549
another question to us um but so this is

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,890
something that is solved in a different

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,840
way in snaps or in the snap the world

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,900
you will actually have a per

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,629
architecture snap this is basically

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,629
because we know already that snap

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,000
packages will be big because they have

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,040
to bring their all of their own

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,650
dependencies and so bringing them all

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,930
for multiple architectures on top of

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,430
that would be would be probably too

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,139
difficult so today you know every app

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,480
developer can do this for themselves

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,480
just bring it bring it in your Pike

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,609
uploaded this door make sure you say in

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,500
your manifest that this is a multi arch

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,159
and which outlet which are actually

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,349
supposed supported and so this will just

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,349
work and there goes my god

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,230
your immediate magni hug sorry one more

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,390
from daniel is the Xenia overlay safe

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,930
for use in the Zinio desktop I'm

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:06,140
assuming he means the overlay PPA no

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,200
surely yay which is for historical

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,800
reasons called stable phone overlaid and

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,880
yes this is totally tape this is this is

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,209
where we will be landing all the

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,810
packages like most of our workloads

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,080
today land at the same time for vivid so

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,140
for the distribution that our phones are

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,240
based on right now and in parallel the

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,270
London signal so there's basically

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,220
nothing more that will that will land in

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,430
the overlaid and what lands for the

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,430
phone

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:47,380
all right zigga is asking how do you see

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:50,259
snappy affecting convergence I don't I

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,110
don't think it affects convergence any

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:55,750
different then it would affect you know

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,530
if we were doing phone in and of itself

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,539
just because today we work off of one

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,419
code base that is truly transforming

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,220
between form factors it's it's kind of a

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,599
no hit that the fact that there's a

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,180
long-term plan to move over to snappy

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:17,680
technologies is that you know that's a I

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,539
guess an independent issue I think it's

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,090
a bigger impact on developers than

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:24,550
actually right right I think that the

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,000
fact is that our teams actually work

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,159
closer to what snappy built out from

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,530
right so clicks are something that that

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,389
and clicks in the phone the whole update

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,280
story of the phone is what snap you came

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,830
out of and we are still in that world

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,190
and so basically snap before us is

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,949
probably just a new way or new way of

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,990
packaging thing just gonna land exactly

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,479
it's the second version and so this

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,719
maybe maybe will you coming from like

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,250
the traditional never base desktop maybe

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,280
you have something take you that you

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,259
know that we're not aware no I thought

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,940
you pretty much covered it and going

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,400
back to a question that dial art earlier

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,880
which is about when's snappy personal

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,460
don't happen so the concept behind

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,949
snappy personal is it like a bun to call

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,710
but it's got some extra goodness in it

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,620
that you would need for a desktop so as

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,919
a bad example it might include like the

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,479
gtk libraries and the cube libraries and

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,030
a few other bits and bobs that you would

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,380
expect there to be on a desktop machine

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,110
so you know depending on what we do with

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,419
that and there is no there is no planter

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,560
to do much work on that the moment we

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,669
still need to think about it we still

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,969
need to work out what it's going to do

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,069
and how to work but once that work is

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,500
done and we've made those decisions then

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,330
it should be very very easy from our

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,400
perspective to put a desktop together it

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,480
will just be a case of taking the unity

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,430
eight block and the mere block and

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,460
you know plugging them together and out

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,140
pops a desktop so I yeah I don't get my

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,210
much different so currently unity eight

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,340
works with click packages it expects

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,280
click packages and the places that click

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,610
installs to what work is going to be

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,240
involved to get that to work on a snappy

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:21,430
and the the hybrid snappy and debt based

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:25,490
packages desktop in the future who apps

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,550
apps package that snaps natively will

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,560
actually come sooner to the unity 8

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,540
desktop than they are going to come to

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,900
and to detach devices for a few reasons

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:42,770
some of those are kernel versions others

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,060
are you know what what the patch stock

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,960
currently is built upon and so there is

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,180
there's relatively no good reason why

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,960
what we call snappy the dimension on

00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,380
classic would not work on unity H on the

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,660
desktop there's a bit there's a bit bit

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,480
of clamping that we need to still make

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,100
happen between them but but think that

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,540
this this will happen the soonest that

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:15,050
absolutely that you can install as snaps

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,250
that you can install on on unity seven

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,220
today will finish work on the mt 8

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,250
desktop moving the phone to stop is a

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:29,540
little bit further away just because if

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:33,560
you know more important work still and

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,720
that's what Saavik was saying about the

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,570
plumbing needed to be done on unity a

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,919
desktop to support that snap experience

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,870
is mainly around interfaces so if you've

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,900
attended some of our other sessions

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,370
yesterday encore interfaces the the

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,920
technology is the same basically where

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,380
we have a unity 7 interface and Alexa

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,630
x11 interface today we just need to add

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,130
in interface is specific for paths that

00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,740
those snaps are going to look

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:11,020
or for unity 8 in mirror okay Daniel

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,970
wants to know do you know of people

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,890
using the typical unity 8 developer

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,270
desktop already for example using it

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,490
with the terminal and the web browser

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:25,100
and if so what's the feedback you've

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,690
been getting well are quite a lot of the

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,970
unity edge developers are using it to

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,380
you every day in order to do their

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,580
development well they're not getting the

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,720
development there necessarily but

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,950
they're they're playing with it all the

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,460
time I think from development point of

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,140
view we're still kind of working at

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,150
exactly how confinement is going to work

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,760
how you're going to be able to deal with

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,250
a confined environment where you need to

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,390
get down dirty into the guts of the

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,770
machine so i don't i personally don't

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,020
know of anybody who's using it to do

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,930
development inside there but I'm

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,680
presumably you can fire up vim in the

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,500
terminal and and crank out some code I

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,580
don't know so your guys doing much in

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,460
there so obviously you know we do most

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,010
of our work actually on devices next to

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,640
our laptops right because we mostly

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:22,130
develop for that's our main focus this

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,610
devices that can be desktops but are

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,520
actually the form factor is a phone or a

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,380
tablet but this is getting closer and

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,630
closer like hangouts is a highlight of

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,060
like whew whew last week's that you know

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:38,300
your web RTC improvements in the Ubuntu

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,780
browser may mean that you you are able

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,600
today to use welp angad's Tokyo or

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,640
whatever whatever other web RTC based

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,360
system that that you want on top of that

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:55,340
and IRC clients something that we used

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,160
daily for we have extra known on the m10

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,490
tablet so you can use that really this

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,350
is just someone needs to pull the

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,630
trigger on themselves and just switch to

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,760
it it's we haven't we haven't that

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,710
there's just things that will not work

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,930
right for you there will be a few bits

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,140
missing but overall it's you know it's

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,610
getting ready for you I think just just

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,840
to add to what sabich's saying to you is

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,300
we actually want people

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,340
to do that right we want to get a ground

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,500
swell of people starting to do that so

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,810
it'll help us get focus on things that

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,270
need to get fixed all right so then on

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,720
that topic how would a typical ubuntu

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:36,860
desktop user runnings inial start using

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,820
unity eight today apt-get install unity

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,890
no was it unity 8 desktop session me

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,750
package name correct do that and then it

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,060
will pop up in your greeter as an

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,860
alternate accession drop down the list

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,450
will see a number right there click on

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,920
that and you're into your user yet

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:57,830
session if you have free open-source

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,100
graphics drivers ER and it won't work

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:04,730
with commercial graphics drivers yet

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,380
though so Daniels next question is do we

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,820
have any updates on when we might get

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,820
support from the proprietary driver

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,730
developers like Nvidia and Andy yeah so

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,670
there's there is actually active work on

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,230
going with our partners and again up you

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,210
know every time I do one of these public

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,410
sessions I'm always hesitant to talk

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,870
about dates and that kind of thing

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,460
because that is there you know it is up

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,380
to our partners to decide when they're

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,630
ready to release and they have their own

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,210
roadmaps and that sort of thing but they

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,770
are being pushed you know from the

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,210
industry to have a model that fits

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,720
basically mirror and Wayland right so

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,370
that that's really helped get them

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,680
situated to where we can do some

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,150
integration activity and that's that's

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,600
really all I can say is that work is

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,600
happening

00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,200
alright the next one is from Dale is

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,630
asking is snappy personal image still

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,940
viable and I think maybe he means is it

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,180
is it going to be a standalone image or

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,820
is it going to be a combination of

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,370
snappy Ubuntu core and additional snaps

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,410
to provide that personal computing

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,330
experience yeah it's going to build off

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,300
of so it'll be a superset of the snap

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,460
model that when two quarters using now

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,250
there's some discussion amongst the team

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,980
members about how exactly you know do

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,260
you do you just make a big fat OS snap

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,420
that's different than the OS snap on a

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,150
good to core or do you break it out and

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,150
have yet another snap let's say like a I

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,590
don't know a shell snap or something

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,750
there's questions like that that we have

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,400
to answer but it's going to follow

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,400
architectural e the same model

00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:51,479
alright yeah i think when we originally

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,899
started using terms like snappy personal

00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:56,339
we didn't have the OS as its own snap we

00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,139
were like we're on the phone where we've

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,229
got a system image and then we just a

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,749
big in ideas on top that right all right

00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:05,910
siga wants to know how we plan on

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:07,979
supporting multiple monitors with

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,419
different DP is in a way that is

00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:14,609
transparent to end-users and so this is

00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,939
something i think this is this has been

00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:20,879
solved even by 87 million we can choose

00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:24,059
a different scale on a different on

00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,279
different screens and then if you have

00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,109
multiple multiple screens that have

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,559
different scales then the app will have

00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:33,389
to be rendered per screen so if you move

00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,949
move an application between screens it

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:38,309
will have to be rendered at a different

00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:42,059
scale on top of that the compositor will

00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:44,399
apply tricks too because some talk it

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,189
will support scaling to any random

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,350
number others will only support integers

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:53,369
and even other apps won't support any

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:58,109
scaling at all so this will ultimately

00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:59,970
the compositor will do the rest of the

00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:02,399
work right so if we tell if the user

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,399
says that they want their display at

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,339
scale 2.3 whatever that means and

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,639
whether if the app returns to us okay i

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,489
can draw at 2.32 purush mice here's me

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,529
rendering at 2.3 that's fine if the app

00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:18,720
comes back and says i can only scale at

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,399
2 point 0 then the point 3 on top of

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,699
that this cut the compositor will just

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,350
scale it you know zoom in and so it's so

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,329
it still looks in place and then on top

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,359
and ultimately when the appt goes and

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,819
well it doesn't go as in it has no

00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:35,639
answer and we will have to assume that

00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:38,459
it's rendering at scale 1 and just you

00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,850
know zoom in so this will be talk it's

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,589
moving in and to support this more and

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,619
more more and more cool kids today

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:51,379
support this then this will be you know

00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:51,379
well an ongoing effort basic

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,680
okay I'm glad we've got steven webb on

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,649
here for this next one that's from

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,009
daniel he's asking how well do

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:08,180
traditional x11 apps run on unity 8 what

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:11,809
is still missing for them the answer to

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:15,019
that is well complicated we're working

00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:18,769
at parting tool kits so that they run

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:21,139
natively on mirror instead of X 11 but

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,720
it turns out there's a lot of stuff

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:26,749
that's going to be missing because X

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,759
itself is expanded so so much over the

00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:33,470
decades we have a subset of stuff that

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,170
we know has we've tested and it works

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,559
great using the libertines container

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:43,819
system on unity 8 and some of the other

00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:46,249
stuff it's got problems still there's

00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:48,259
there's issues like multiple windows not

00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,269
displaying properly and that sort of

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,670
thing and we've got a plan to get this

00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:55,509
all fixed over the next couple of cycles

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,639
it's not there yet we're looking at

00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:02,959
needing more work on window management

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:06,709
on scaling on a various keyboard and

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,689
accessibility support but fact is you

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,819
can actually get stuff up and running

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,709
now I have on the machine I'm talking to

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,529
you and on I have a whole lot of games

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:18,159
installed that run on X 11 and they work

00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:21,740
with my touch screen and it just works

00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:24,649
but there's things like for example if

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,659
you try running the you have to run

00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:29,630
it in single window mode and not in

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,220
multi window mode and yeah we've got

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:36,289
stuff in the works it's just not there

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,240
yet these things take time how about the

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,539
things like copy paste does that work

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,520
across between native mirror and XP your

00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,980
apps that's another one of the things

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,070
that that is on our agenda to get done

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,500
in the next cycle you know a lot of

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,049
these are not useful until that's that

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:58,669
kind of thing is in there but it's hard

00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:01,250
slogging and we're making progress it's

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,399
all the terror works great well that

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,589
it's the important one right

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,599
ninety percent of everybody's time I

00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,219
mean I would like to just highlight

00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,950
there though you know I mean it's it's

00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:15,309
always an argument about you know

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,169
getting a feature out that's useful but

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,049
maybe does it have every single thing

00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:23,349
that a person would want it right but it

00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:25,989
allows us now with you know the m10 out

00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:27,519
and having X apps on there it does allow

00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:30,969
us to gain a certain level of confidence

00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,889
and pipe clean our own activity and get

00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:34,749
it to a point of stability so that we

00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:36,580
can incrementally add these features and

00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:38,529
feel confident about it rather than just

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,940
trying to do a big bang you know here's

00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,729
every single feature in the world and

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,409
have a mess on our hands there's also

00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:48,700
one more thing I wanted to add one of

00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:52,299
the reasons for mere was to go away from

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,789
Sam paradigms some old style paradigms

00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:57,879
in for example window management that we

00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:02,499
know now don't work well and so this is

00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:04,210
why like I don't see ourselves basically

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:07,539
because this is something that we could

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:11,080
in theory do is pass x windows up from

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,849
through X mirror up to unity 844 window

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,219
management but this would actually

00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:17,229
require us to bring again those window

00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:19,899
management paradigms into unity eight

00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:23,070
that we've gone away from in the first

00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:27,960
place and so I see us rather

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:31,929
implementing real support for parole or

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,710
we're in the new new approach that we've

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:38,679
kept you've designed if a few years ago

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,200
by now in mere rather than just you know

00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,269
copying what X was doing and and then

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,249
just you know pushing them through this

00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:48,460
is why X mirror is the back in the

00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:50,139
interim solution for which we probably

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,379
will never have you know a hundred

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:56,619
percent feature parity with with X 11

00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:59,049
with x 11 shells with x 11 environment

00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,999
and but our goal will actually be to

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:03,239
bring all of those natively into

00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:08,049
interred in you brave new world

00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:11,200
absolutely okay so today if I were to

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,629
switch log out and log back into a unity

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,629
eight shell on my laptop and I want to

00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,900
try running a traditional desktop app

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:21,490
that

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,500
yus that's python and gtk what's what

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,790
approach should I take to try and get

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,790
that running under unity 8

00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:36,070
I think today the best is truly working

00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:37,989
right through X mere libertine if you

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,440
don't know there's been sessions about

00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:43,269
it but so just a brief brief outline is

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,320
technically a technology that allows us

00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:49,330
to create a container with the minimal

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,690
ubuntu installation basically unit and

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:55,299
then you can apt-get install any

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:58,059
application out there and long-term Matt

00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:00,309
right now today but we are working on

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,080
employment on integrating that into the

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,059
rest of the index episode that you will

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,049
launch the launch it in the same way

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:10,119
that you launch any other apps and that

00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:13,600
you know long-term this will be as

00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:17,379
simple as we can make it but it will be

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,049
it will be a X application running

00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:21,820
within its own window management inside

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,440
X mere and that will be your whole

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,840
window so in case there are multiple

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,889
windows displayed and from that app the

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,989
things make it funky ok so if I already

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:35,259
have it installed and I already have you

00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:37,029
know my standard Ubuntu environment on

00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,830
my laptop do I still need to put it

00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,989
under libertine to get it to run under

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,609
unity a torque in it yeah yeah so I

00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:45,340
think you're getting in a question which

00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:47,529
frequently comes up so there is no X

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,600
when you're running your unity a desktop

00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,759
session right so if you just fire it up

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,950
straight away there's no X involved it's

00:21:51,759 --> 00:22:00,039
all mirror that's that's all you're

00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:02,220
seeing there ok so I do I'd still need

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,749
to put that libertine container to get

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,299
clear capable where is in your future

00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:10,210
reason early Burton is actually the

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,659
security part of this whole story under

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:17,619
unity a 10 year we don't want any apps

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:21,330
to run inside your home directory inside

00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:24,460
your you know your system and confined

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,279
this and then basically like having

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,509
support for that on top of allowing you

00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,369
to actually have libertine like

00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,950
libertine is actually a superset of what

00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:34,950
you can do with today's technologies

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,470
right so we would rather focus on you on

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,929
you getting it through there then like

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,860
supporting it natively both you know

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,799
just install

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,780
it's on your on your main system and run

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,600
from there just because you can you can

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,970
do the same in a better way inside the

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,520
inside the container right there there's

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,010
there's nothing is like with the

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,110
exception of qml apps that you opt get

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,120
installed which are there aren't many

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,059
and like most of them are actually

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,670
available in clicks already right

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:11,440
there's not that much that you can gain

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:13,420
here okay so do we have documentation on

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,910
how to set up this libertine container

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:20,919
Stephen there is some documentation it

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,900
would be best if people who are good at

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,140
writing documentation help us write some

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,000
better documentation but yes there's

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,890
some stuff on the wiki on how to set it

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,480
up okay moving on then we've got zigga

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,669
who's asking do you track the

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,200
performance of mirror and unity eight in

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,440
an automatic manner during the

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,010
development cycle so the answer is yes

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,020
and that's constantly growing right so

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:50,200
you may be familiar recently we had a

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:54,250
pretty nasty regression happen with the

00:23:50,200 --> 00:24:01,210
spread um on I think it mainly exhibited

00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:04,380
itself on the e4 and drilled down found

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,270
out that that was a basically a GPU

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,520
quark is what I would call it right so

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:12,700
we were using the device in a in a way

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,020
that was accepted by spec but had a had

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:19,419
a funky performance response so as part

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,290
of that we fixed it and then we added an

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:25,660
automated test as part of our CI and so

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,250
we have we have automated test as part

00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,590
of CI and then those just keep getting

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:34,059
added to every time we you know stumble

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:37,679
across something like that so I often

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:41,290
see in comments people speculating on

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,660
performance of unity 8 vs unity 7 do you

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,130
have any metrics that shows both

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,770
performance and like resource

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:52,320
requirements and memory usage for a

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,320
unity eighth session compared to unity 7

00:24:52,790 --> 00:25:00,480
we don't and I mean that's it's a little

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:02,910
apples and oranges right I mean it's not

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,500
sure it's a completely fair comparison

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,710
and that that doesn't only go for

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:13,620
necessarily the toolkit part of it but

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:17,190
even you know how how the you know our

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:20,700
current system is more secure right so

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:22,110
we've we've taken pains to have some

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,480
intermediaries between certain

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,610
activities that isn't you know that's

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,790
not an excuse for every single thing and

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,010
we're we are actively looking at some

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,020
what we call key performance indicators

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,810
right so the dash scrolling and swiping

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,390
and trying to dive down into what

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,700
exactly are the bottlenecks there that

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,830
we could improve on so but i but i think

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,650
it's you know it's maybe a little unfair

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,430
to to try to compare when you've got you

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:53,580
know a qml app versus the pure see app

00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,040
for instance i think also we probably

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,170
just need to choose a few a few

00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,240
scenarios right that you can come /

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,920
because what does it mean to come per

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,960
performance of two shells that actually

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,060
look look differently by now right there

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,070
you know they are implemented

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,170
differently because they are supposed to

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,940
look differently but things like you

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,510
know probably we can we can go on and

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,700
and look at things how much how do we

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,860
render video right if you open you know

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,600
if you open if you a video player how

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,180
much does it take you to composite that

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:30,660
all right and things like that we can we

00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:33,840
can definitely add measurements for and

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,930
that all said when i run open up libre

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,880
office or the through x mere it

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,100
seems to run just as fast as when I'm

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,290
running it natively I don't have numbers

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,680
but that's the way it feels it doesn't

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,680
feel slower

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:52,610
all right sergio is asking has anyone

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:55,990
test running the snappy plumbing on Anna

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,990
bunt to phone or tablet

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:06,820
I don't think this is part of our effort

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,480
right now and the we will we will need

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,710
to get to that unless surgery can

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,990
explain more on what do you mean by

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:19,179
snappy plan we'll see if it comes back

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,610
with more details on that night I can

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:25,440
only guess you might mean like taking

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:28,120
the snap experience that you can have on

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,770
the classic unity seven today and then

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,740
just taking that over putting it on the

00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:35,020
phone and the answer is no but it's

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,030
something that I think we got on our

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:43,960
list of stuff to cook tinker with an

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:45,730
experiment with ok I'll may hos asking

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,039
what do you think is the future of steam

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,740
in a bun to do you see a future for

00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,080
games that snaps or see a big snap of

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,169
steam with the games inside it and I'll

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,210
also add on to that will steam games be

00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:03,730
running natively on mirror or will they

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:06,520
have to go through XP I think that

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,159
you're more likely to see steam as one

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,870
big snap this is our experience we've

00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,840
actually got it up and running in a

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:18,370
libertine container so they're running

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,669
through X mere mostly because many games

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:25,450
and including the steam client itself

00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:27,880
just assume X and do all kinds of things

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,090
they shouldn't be doing proper

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,070
environment but because steam actually

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,590
installs most of the games inside itself

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:39,940
as opposed to on to your system it's

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:42,480
almost acting like a snap now so I would

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,870
say it's more likely to be one big snap

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,870
for all steam

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,500
which is really steams I think ideal way

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,110
of doing it they want to be the one that

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,620
delivers and manages all the games in

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,620
stained

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,270
alright the next one is from Chloe

00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,100
Wolfie girl and it's actually kind of

00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,650
two questions so I'm going to break it

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,710
up the first one is how long will it be

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:13,400
until keyboard shortcuts work and here

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,540
I'm assuming she means in unity 8 and

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,160
when will we have the same kind of

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:22,290
keyboard navigation that we have in

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,450
unity 7 like minus 2 months roughly or

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,400
more than that actually so most of the

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,270
keyboard shortcuts that you have an 87

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,760
as in the shell ones so I'll tough out

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,700
the fourth to kill an apt super have

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,120
superb something so all of the features

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,700
that are therefore ugh as should have

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,490
corresponding corresponding keyboard

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,770
shortcuts on top of that there's apps

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,820
that need to implement their own

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,340
handling of keyboard shortcuts if

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,590
there's a particular shortcut that

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,390
you're missing 48 your apps please file

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,920
the back and we'll take care of it as

00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,080
soon as possible alright the second part

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,410
of her question i'm not entirely sure

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,450
what she means but she says win with x

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:09,180
11 on the desktop can we just apt-get

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,280
and have the icons in the app scope or

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,220
is there still a lot to go through

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,150
before that works i'm not sure if she

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:23,400
means installing snaps on unity 7 or

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:26,880
installing deb apps in unity eight but i

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,080
think for the case of unity 8 you

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,690
mentioned before that they would go

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,580
through the libertines container in

00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,970
order to get into like the app scope and

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:40,590
be launched Apple in unity eight right

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:42,180
exactly that's our goal action we're

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,370
never never going to have Deb's

00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,560
installed and just run in unity ages for

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:50,940
Zen oh that's that's the thing in the

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:53,250
past ok have yet we actually do today

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,170
even even on the even and attached

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,720
devices that there's a few leftovers

00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,250
that we were not able to package up or

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,470
didn't have the time to package up as

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,280
clicks simply because of confinement

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,770
reasons etc but that doctors always tell

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,350
temporary we want to want to have

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,730
everything packaged up as clicks for the

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,440
phone simply because of

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,400
liberally reason so we can for example

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,700
issue a software update of just web

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,890
browser if we find a you know a security

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,040
to in there for example and without

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:30,220
having to rehabbing to deploy a whole

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,040
system update so all of those we want to

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:37,840
package up us as clicks or flight there

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,809
s snaps and then so right now we do pick

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,000
up desktop files from you know apt-get

00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,130
install the applications but this is

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,980
something that you want to go move away

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,600
from and go as mentioned before go

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,630
through burton because this is just a

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,419
better way for us in the long term and

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:59,620
there's basically nothing that you lose

00:31:55,419 --> 00:32:03,150
or gain compared to compared to up get

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,150
installing metal natively

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,710
all right Daniel is asking can we have a

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:13,440
meta package which pulls in the unity

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,780
desktop session the clicks scope and all

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,340
the good stuff we expect to have in a

00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:23,100
for unity 8 desktop yeah so I think we

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,900
have I think that the UT 8 desktop

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,790
session mere package is supposed to have

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,450
the cliq scope and the browser in it

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:32,790
already if that's not working then

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,860
that's a bug anything above and beyond

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:39,390
that then we can certainly think about

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:41,820
and looking quick a bit 1610 but for 604

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,920
it shouldn't be there it was not think

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,080
that the bug i'm pretty sure it's all

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,480
there I don't recall installing the

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,100
quick scopes separately and it was there

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,200
last time I tried it yeah it is browser

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,000
was there for me too but I have the

00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,450
browser installed as a dip package on

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,520
unity 7 also so i'm not sure where that

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:08,690
one was coming from we also plan to put

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,510
everything into the seed for the iso for

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,630
1610 if i'm not mistaken right so we had

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:19,740
install right I really so it will be

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:22,290
part of the default I so insane 10 it

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,910
will be a non-default session yeah we're

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,950
really you know and I know a lot of

00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,400
people have chuckled it you know we keep

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,660
showing up saying it'll be there but um

00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,040
1604 it really should have been there

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,320
right we just ran out of time and

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,430
there's a lot of bureaucracy that we had

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,070
to get through and then there were some

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,190
of these lingering bugs so but that

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:44,220
should all I mean it's there are orders

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:46,890
yeah like I consider that being there if

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,720
it's in the archives and available don't

00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,810
think it has two had to be on the I soda

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,370
to meet that goal well I do wonder that

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,660
will be every one step better because

00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,140
you won't have to install anything at

00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:03,090
that point is that why we're targeting a

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:05,750
larger I sir sighs next time no not what

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:08,460
not the main reason but as I don't know

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,640
yeah then the most important thing to

00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:15,780
say about it at UTA not being in 1604 by

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,880
default is well yeah so first of all as

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,730
we say it's not feature complete

00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,570
but who wants something in the nests in

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,860
an LTS release that isn't you know as

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,050
good as it possibly could be so

00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,880
releasing NLCS when it's not one hundred

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,770
percent efficient is a stupid idea so

00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,330
that's why we didn't do it because doing

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,330
that would have been a stupid idea oh

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:40,500
hello faronics users I'm talking to you

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:46,920
oh man there is stoking the fire now

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:49,050
we'll all right uh move folio I'm not

00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,880
sure how to pronounce that it's asking

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,390
will we be able to sync stuff like

00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,220
contacts files installed apps etc

00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:58,730
between our devices running ubuntu in a

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,990
way which is easy for normal people

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:07,220
implying perhaps that we're not normal

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:10,260
people meeple you go and yeah well I

00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,600
that's obviously a go right I don't

00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,050
think this is like especially like up

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:18,990
sinking these are things that have to

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,930
happen you know one step at a time we do

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,400
have support for four contacts and

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,130
calendar syncing with google and the

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,310
guys are working right now on storage

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,650
framework and a corresponding backups

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:35,400
framework built on top of it that will

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:38,340
support any storage solution that you

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,840
well that you build support for into it

00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,430
right so it would be modular it will

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,250
have you will you will be able to add

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,940
support for it for other things and

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:51,210
applications will be able to to use the

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,700
system so when this happens you should

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,410
be able to the app should be able to

00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,900
just give give data to the backups

00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,830
framework and that will get stored on a

00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,600
backup framework of your almost storage

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:07,920
solution of your choice beat owncloud

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,280
dropbox or or carriers or carriers

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,850
storage backup buchans and then pull it

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,280
down again on another phone so some some

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,820
thinking syncing can can be built on top

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,820
of that as well

00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:25,869
okay on thicknezz asking is there anyone

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,549
looking at theming across different form

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,650
factors would it be possible for

00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:34,170
community to hack on a different theme

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,170
for unity eight and the SDK apps

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:42,980
so there is something support built into

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:45,870
the you IDK tube into the toolkit I

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,470
don't know the details details on how

00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:52,620
it's extendable what are the plans there

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:54,960
etc them it gives me the slight

00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,720
difference this is something that we've

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,450
talked about before the difference

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:05,280
between the original winter model and

00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:09,710
how apps are delivered today on to your

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,660
devices is that they may or may not

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:15,650
respect any theming choices that you

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,320
that you do anyway and on top of that

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,620
application developers like to control

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,820
exactly how they're up looks like and

00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,480
because of branding because of whatever

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:31,140
reasons so I think the we've come to the

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,930
conclusion that this is not a sorry but

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,170
this is not a very important thing to do

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,000
and this is actually like more the

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,190
theming that we've built was actually

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,910
more a tool for developers to be able to

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:47,160
create a theme based on the on the basic

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,530
the basic themes to to grant their own

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,380
apps and and not for users to choose

00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:55,200
between between themes to be applied

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,570
across their apps that said we will like

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,310
if nothing else for accessibility

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,490
reasons we will have to support and

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,140
high-contrast themes and some of some of

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,990
the living that you choose will probably

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,700
be applied to apps but it's it's

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,380
ultimately the app developers choice

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:15,690
what they want how they want to look

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:18,270
like alright daniel has a challenge for

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:20,580
you he's asking if we can ask the

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,480
engineers or maybe engineering managers

00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:26,700
to do a 10 days with unity 8 challenge

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,370
and I'll add on to that what exactly is

00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:33,410
the minimum set of features that you

00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,410
need to do such a challenge

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,530
what Daniel what Daniel means is for us

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,130
to just go and run you need for 10 days

00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:45,530
and find what not working so to be

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:50,780
honest these days I think I could do my

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:53,240
job on in g8 by now I think that I'd you

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,119
know you've been transferring firefox to

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,190
the unity it account and that would be

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,920
like you know ninety percent of my of my

00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,740
workflow email might be slightly

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,920
trickier but I can do the Judaism on web

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:10,430
or transfer tobacco I haven't tried

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,589
adecco on a desktop yet but you know it

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,800
has been a vergence layout now so that

00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:16,760
should actually be pretty good and it's

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,890
worth saying when we were putting

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,290
together the original list of packages

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,160
that should be in the puritan container

00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:28,280
we specifically spec those out so that

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,869
you know most users man in Street should

00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,310
be able to do sort of eighty percent of

00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,650
the things that they would need to do on

00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,510
their desktop with that with that step

00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,329
faculties in the container plus the core

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:41,180
apps so yeah it should be absolutely

00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:44,990
possible to do attend a challenge with

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,430
would be immune to yet as it is now so

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,609
yeah I think we've been pretty good

00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,609
shape

00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:58,630
okay sounds like a challenge there for

00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:01,000
you guys then zig is asking stating

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,970
rather mirror is more secure than X and

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,040
this allows some invasive things how do

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,530
we plan to support screen capture

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,099
accessibility tools and other things

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:15,540
that traditionally use these rich and

00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,540
unsafe features of X 11

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,940
good question help us answer yeah well

00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,220
the mere does have some privileged AP is

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:30,490
for implementing those things but

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:33,870
they're not available to regular

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:36,520
applications and have to go through

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,860
authorization API is that sort of thing

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,650
I don't know what the plan is for that

00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:46,450
but the hooks are there so there's some

00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:49,330
security and design considerations that

00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,580
need to go into figuring isn't if it's

00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:58,600
possible to safely expose bridge to be

00:40:51,580 --> 00:41:01,210
crossed yet ok I think is just so what

00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,030
one thing and especially on a touch

00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,060
device or on a phone as this has been

00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,600
done before but a lot of all that stuff

00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:12,100
is actually we have to design how does

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,710
accessibility work on those kind of

00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,680
interfaces right because traditionally

00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,720
no alt tab or tab tab tab tab and you

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,180
get you know you get the content right

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,920
out and but that you know you don't have

00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,000
a you don't have a you don't have

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,410
physical feedback on a on a phone touch

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,470
device right so this is something that

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:34,390
we have to look into it from also from

00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,310
from the site of how does it actually

00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:41,970
how it is actually supposed to look like

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:41,970
or feel like or here Ike sound like

00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,819
okay Daniel is asking where would you

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,099
suggest volunteers should go to get

00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:53,599
involved in order to get us to a

00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,599
converged world faster

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:05,830
you know um we're probably at the point

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,000
where you can try it out file bugs this

00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,580
is this i think this is the most

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,950
important thing right just you know log

00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,560
into a unity session do a 10 date

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,900
challenge for yourself now I'm file box

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,060
with us so that we can so that we can

00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,060
find what are the most pressing things

00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,800
that didn't work for you so that we can

00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,170
prioritize them so that we can build

00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,720
them into Oh them into our road maps and

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,820
obviously help with you know apps file

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,300
file box against apps that don't work

00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,670
well yet when you we say resize them all

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:42,520
those kinds of stuff right just try it

00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:44,970
out all right and what project should

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,440
they file bugs on is there one kind of

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:51,010
gateway project for that that we can

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,830
then redirect bugs I mean you know use

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:57,300
your best judgement I think most people

00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,500
tend to use unity eight as the basis for

00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,270
you know I don't know where to file it

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,950
out but I know this is unity eight so it

00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,920
ends up there and then we'll we'll

00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:08,730
figure it out and get it to the right

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,730
person

00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:18,380
okay oh where is asking will I be able

00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:21,800
to cast my laptop screen to my TP so

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,980
that the whole wireless display that

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,330
we're putting into phones and tablets

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,250
now is that going to be something we can

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:33,740
do from the desktop and there is

00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:37,520
everything that we've built is built in

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:39,860
a way to support that that said I I'm

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,450
not sure like what's the current status

00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,790
of support for gstreamer or on that for

00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,540
that matter hardware encoding on you

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:53,390
know on unlocked up GPUs but this is

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,670
possible the solution is build so it can

00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:59,330
soup so it should support that and so

00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:04,250
long term yes you know some some

00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:06,020
enablement know and I've required yeah

00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,910
we're a little hesitant to comment too

00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,390
much there's another team that owns a

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:13,340
fair amount of that but it has been

00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:17,360
built in a way that we want to be an

00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:20,060
support any like each and every single

00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,550
piece of that puzzle is replaceable and

00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,220
so you know encoding the video you can

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:27,230
do you can do this tumor with software

00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,180
you can the gstreamer with hardware or

00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,970
you can do you know it something

00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,150
something custom all together streaming

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:37,700
to miracast is rtsp but you can do again

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,380
a different pipeline or a different

00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,840
different streaming solutions all

00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:44,510
together so it is built in a way that

00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:49,510
all kinds of combinations should work

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:49,510
long-term again salmon ableman required

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,299
alright Omer is also asking have you

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,640
have there been any thoughts on starting

00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:59,579
with a hybrid snappy based system on the

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,980
desktop for example snap Yvonne to core

00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,380
plus the remaining system components on

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,329
a read/write container and that sounds

00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,809
an awful lot like what libertine is

00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,809
isn't it

00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:24,010
yeah sort of only less so I can't leave

00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:27,940
you to expand on that a little well it's

00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:33,970
it's yeah I guess it could be seen as

00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:38,110
that um yeah I just never thought of it

00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:42,580
that way before so in other words I

00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,790
haven't started that but so on the the

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,710
current um tablet it's not snappy yet

00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:51,250
obviously it's still click but you've

00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,930
got the read-only system image and then

00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,880
you've got click packages but then

00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,790
you've got this other space where you

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,610
can install traditional desktop stuff

00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,440
that's not that that's in a safe little

00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:05,170
container where it can run unconfined in

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,880
that container absolutely so it does do

00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,710
sort of what's described their the

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,770
difference is that you can't really

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:15,220
install system level stuff and expect it

00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:18,790
to start working on your system in the

00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,620
same way because you're contained you

00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:25,840
don't have actual system level access

00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:31,480
outside of the container right so it's

00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:33,310
not only is that getting to read but it

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,150
makes this kind of frown right like I

00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:39,610
don't think we necessarily like that

00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,740
yeah you'll you'll be disappointed if

00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,980
you try using it for anything except a

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,450
typical application as opposed to you

00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,690
know you want to run a web server or

00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,690
something

00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,580
alright the next one is from puppy and

00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:59,210
he wants to know if we can switch from X

00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:03,550
chat which is unmaintained now to hex

00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,550
chat in the the libertines container

00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:12,960
that would actually been be in purity in

00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,970
which is a a curated libertine container

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,380
that's distributed on some of the

00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:23,160
devices and well I'll repeat what I said

00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,860
earlier is that our aim is to get rid of

00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,540
the Puritan container entirely and just

00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,480
allow people install whatever the heck

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:33,450
they want in a libertine container so if

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:39,180
you want xjet install hex check that's

00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:40,800
coming not right away but soon so what

00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:44,940
is the difference between libertine and

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:48,210
puritan then a Puritan is just a pre

00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,130
rolled curated container containing a

00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:55,410
bunch of applications it gets installed

00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:57,420
on on it for example on the tablet it is

00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,370
a regular libertine container it just

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,010
has some stuff already stuffed into it

00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,660
for you and when we install it we

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,690
actually install it and read only memory

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:12,650
so you can cook and actually install

00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:14,940
additional stuff into it that's all okay

00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:17,250
Daniel's asking what are the next big

00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:22,710
blocks to land can you share what's next

00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:24,900
on your road map we can we can share

00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,330
what previously on the road map so the

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,060
last few weeks were actually about one

00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,670
question that was asked before different

00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:35,010
DPI's in scaling and so a huge effort

00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:39,090
went into us actually being able to

00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:42,360
dynamically change and the grid unit

00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:45,810
size so the thing that we have in ubuntu

00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,940
UI toolkit that we used to scale

00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:50,910
applications to a particle display and

00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:53,430
so this we've done this to enable Wi-Fi

00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:58,170
display for for the upcoming device for

00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:00,720
major pro 5 because Wi-Fi display on it

00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,910
meant that the density of its screen

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,930
meant that if you connect an external

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:09,810
screen that was 10 atg and it was say

00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:12,180
for example a 50-inch TV then essing

00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:14,940
then you could probably fit around four

00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,220
or five icon app icons on the screen and

00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,050
that was all and so this was actually

00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,660
what we would just landed today

00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:24,620
support for that is going into OT 11 so

00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,030
Wi-Fi display in a way that with the

00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,910
proof the pro/5 you will be able to use

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:35,100
your desktop streamed wirelessly to do

00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:37,170
hopefully any miracast device but there

00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,960
are plenty of quirks around that so you

00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,780
know we will have to we will have to

00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,780
make sure that we enable you know the

00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,940
most of them so if you try it please let

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,060
us know what doesn't work with your

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,210
Wi-Fi display next that only Wi-Fi this

00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,580
player will that work over slimport

00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:58,080
wired connection yes the like the

00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,150
different scaling that were over

00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,510
slimport for whatever devices do have

00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:06,300
that but this is so that the impact of

00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,340
it actually depends on what the devices

00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,250
original original scale was so for

00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,230
example for the m10 tablet things were a

00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:16,190
little bit bigger than we wanted them to

00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:19,620
be roughly one-and-a-half bigger um

00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:23,790
similarly to my co things were probably

00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:27,450
like one in a 1.6 or 1.7 bigger whereas

00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:29,850
for turbo four for the pro/5 it was like

00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:34,080
three times as big and so this is

00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:37,350
basically something that that that the

00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,900
pro/5 required from us which before we

00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:42,330
could say okay this is not working so

00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,360
yes this will work for overseeing poured

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:47,430
over any output as far as as far as the

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:51,240
applications as far as the shell is

00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:53,760
concerned Wi-Fi display is just another

00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,450
display we don't know what the medium is

00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,650
whether it's air or or no or copper

00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:03,450
doesn't really mean anything to us and

00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:09,680
on top of that we're basically gearing

00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:12,570
up to to bringing in 88 up to par for

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,300
traditional window management so we are

00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:19,920
enabling all kinds of stuff we will be

00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:22,260
enabling will be enabling workspaces and

00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,580
they will work slightly differently than

00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:30,110
than what you know on in seven details

00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:32,670
to be to be determined all you know

00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:37,230
proper window management and so

00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:39,540
being able to do have well on that topic

00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:42,000
actually apps today can already launched

00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:45,210
multiple top-level applications under

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,829
ng8 so this is enabling the web browser

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:51,000
to have multiple windows the first the

00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:53,549
basic use case for that the first use

00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,160
case for that is incognito or private

00:51:53,549 --> 00:52:00,780
mode on on the phone so that you can

00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:02,520
have separate separate window which is

00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,799
incognito instead of replacing your

00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,720
current one as it works day but on top

00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:09,240
of that we will need will need more

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,040
window management that that's built in

00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:16,970
and menus indicators we work so

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:19,530
integrating indicators and menus

00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,210
basically I think our focus as you've

00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:25,530
seen over the neck over the past few

00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:27,180
days the topic the theme of of our work

00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:30,059
right now is convergence and getting

00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:34,380
getting everything going on that side of

00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:35,880
the power spectrum so you can note

00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,040
several of the things with unity eight

00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,710
that I've been looking forward to the

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:44,040
one that I haven't heard any news on

00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:47,339
lately is how that the dash is going to

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:53,460
work in a desktop environment right now

00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:55,440
there is no there's no that like no

00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,359
defined designed for it to behave any

00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,109
differently than yesterday so right now

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,510
it is going to be a window um we are

00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:05,460
there are some people in on the design

00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,619
team looking into how this would work

00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:12,329
differently but this is where we are

00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:14,220
right now and this is it's working there

00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:16,799
are you know much bigger topics to take

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:20,970
care of on for us to take you know to

00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:22,950
pay you to make pork on a desktop and

00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:28,109
convert the environment so this is what

00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:30,510
we are focusing on first rate okay how

00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:32,400
about you Kevin are there any big blocks

00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:35,670
about to land in the mirror side of

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,589
things um I'll let Stephen back me up

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:40,799
but at least one that I was thinking of

00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:44,280
that we've been chasing for a long time

00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:46,020
is power D and our screen blanking

00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,940
architecture has been

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,400
sort of the bane of our existence and

00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:53,400
created a lot of bugs and so that's

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,530
coming to the end of an overhaul so that

00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,540
should roll out soon so hopefully

00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:01,080
that'll clear up a lot of those bugs and

00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,790
then another thing in mirror is what we

00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,820
lovingly refer to as new buffer

00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:09,500
semantics and it is just that it is how

00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:11,490
the mirror handles buffer mapping in

00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,160
referencing from the client and it's

00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,660
going to enable us to do two things one

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,000
of which is to implement some

00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,010
performance improvement ideas and then

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,650
the other thing it's actually required

00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,890
for us to take the next steps on Vulcan

00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:29,100
integration and Steven I don't know if

00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:33,420
you have anything else now that those

00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,740
are the big things yeah all right we'll

00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,360
how about from you i know this is still

00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,850
a little bit early for the full desktop

00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,370
integration site but do you have any big

00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:44,010
plans coming up well i think the most

00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:46,170
exciting thing will be mainly inclusion

00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:48,180
requests of unity 8 desktop session

00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,040
mirror or associated components and then

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,710
seeding it into the desktop image for

00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,420
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:58,240
very nice and that brings us to the end

00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,859
of our session so I want to thank the

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,140
four of you for coming on in answering

00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:04,089
all these questions thank you everyone

00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,520
in IRC for asking all of those questions

00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:08,980
and be sure to come back tomorrow for

00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,099
the final day of the up unto on lines of

00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,910
it see you guys then I thank you all

00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:14,910
