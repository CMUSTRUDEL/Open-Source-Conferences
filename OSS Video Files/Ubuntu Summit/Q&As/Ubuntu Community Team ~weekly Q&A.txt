hello and welcome to our regular Ubuntu

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,910
community team Q&A my name's Alan Pope

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,490
and this is daniel hall back olo and

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,770
we're here once again to answer your

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,130
questions about Ubuntu anything related

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,350
to a bun to and the things around it if

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,109
you want to ask questions then the best

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,310
way to do that is to point an IRC client

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:33,390
apps freenode and join the ubuntu hyphen

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,950
on hyphen air IRC channel if you don't

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,899
want to install an IRC client or you

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,809
rather use a browser then just go to 12

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,300
on air calm and you'll see the video in

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,340
the top half of the screen and the chat

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,410
box underneath it pick our username

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,480
connect and then you'll see the same

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,910
chat everyone else does ask you

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,710
questions in there if you prefix them

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,930
with the word question in upper case

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,989
then that gets highlighted in our IRC

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,199
clients so we can pick out the questions

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,940
from the chatter we welcome questions

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,500
from anywhere and everywhere about

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,400
anything and everything we can't answer

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,930
everything and so if we can't but we

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,939
know who might know the answer then

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,470
while one of us is filling for time the

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,110
other one might go and ping someone on

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,960
IRC to find out the answer this happens

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,490
surprisingly often and or alternatively

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,650
we might point you in the direction of

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,369
somewhere else that's a better place to

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,560
ask your question if you want to know

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,140
more about the sessions and when they

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,790
happen the best thing to do is follow

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,250
the various social media accounts for

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,729
which one air is a Twitter account open

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,680
to an air that's a google+ and you can

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,930
also just subscribe to the YouTube

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,270
channel if you're watching this later on

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,860
then unfortunate you can't ask questions

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,770
but you can at least listen in to

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:54,350
everybody else's um have I missed

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:58,860
anything out the low of that's fairly

00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:02,240
accurate good good so how you already

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,890
been up to you then Daniel good good um

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,340
yeah I'm working on on Stephie stuff

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,060
have been helping people looking at up

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,620
stealing some things looking at some

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,190
build failures like

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,140
all kind of stuff already Giuseppe

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:24,030
things are good and I might look at some

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:28,349
training materials next so coming in the

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,579
next few weeks awesome I spent a bit of

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:34,560
last week in Germany in Heidelberg and

00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:37,079
we had a snappy sprint where a bunch of

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,170
canonical employees who work on or

00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:42,599
around snappy and snap crafts got

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,290
together had a whole bunch of hourly

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,989
sessions where we discussed various

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,049
parts of improving snap crafts and

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,209
snappy and the roadmap and plans for

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,730
future development of snappy and snap

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,140
crafts and one of the fun parts was we

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,579
got to invite a bunch of community

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,000
people along as well so people from VLC

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:07,980
elementary Linton Marte there were

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,989
external people who weren't part of any

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,750
particular distribution of people from

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,810
the KDE project there was was really

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,370
good to have such a mix of people and

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,880
some of that some of the sessions were

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,799
quite fiery as one in particular where

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,769
there are lots of opinions being thrown

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,000
around the room and you know people with

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,669
different perspectives from different

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,709
desktops different projects all weighing

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,450
in on how they think things should work

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,629
and how things should be improved in the

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,389
future and you know at the end of it we

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,680
figured out all the what I think most of

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,169
the right answers to all the questions

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,370
we had in the room it was a it was

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,519
awesome it's really good to hang out

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,680
with such a bunch of cool people and so

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,000
that was good should we crack on with

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,730
some of the questions we've got quite a

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,980
few yes unbelievable I think this is the

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,519
first time we've been on time and we've

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,949
had like a few of questions before we of

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,980
it though excellent so let's get

00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,379
cracking then so the first question for

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,049
a bunch of questions that have been

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:13,919
pasted into the IRC channel are from

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,299
blue baby bear who says that won't be

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,010
able to watch light they thought they'd

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,090
leave some questions in IRC and then

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,709
they can watch it later on that's a

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,830
brilliant idea you can always drop by

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,410
the one to on-air IRC Channel and throw

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,210
questions in there

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,040
just before we go live and then you know

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,140
we can we can look at them later so

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,720
first question is up until now nobody's

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,900
seen the new dashboard design of unity 8

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,870
in desktop mode what are you hiding yeah

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:45,440
Daniel what are you hiding with any bit

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,700
odd so all right so I asked for

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,110
clarification on what dashboard we know

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,480
I think what they mean is the dash you

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,830
know the the application launcher and I

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,320
think I don't think it's necessarily

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,950
that we're hiding anything you can

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,840
generally just pull the latest trunk of

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,280
unity ace and all the associated package

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,070
build it run it and you'll see what the

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,800
current state is and it is true that the

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,540
design has been iterated on a number of

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,950
times I don't know what the current

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,780
state of that design is because I don't

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,980
work either in the design team or in the

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:19,070
unity 18 but if you were to drop by

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,370
Ubuntu unity which is the IRC channel

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,070
that the unity developers hang out in

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:28,250
their most welcome in providing

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,690
information and support and you know

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,110
details about what they're currently

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,750
working on so maybe that's the best

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,370
place to ask that question but I don't

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,100
think there's any hiding anything I

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,500
think it's just stuff not finished which

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,200
is usually the way and you don't even

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,310
need to to pull the sauce like obviously

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,980
if you're interested in the source you

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,960
can do that but stuff is also automatic

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,450
all the approved medical presents are

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,669
automatically landed in the distro so

00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:01,130
even either you're on on yakety 1610 or

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,990
do you need to use the overlay PPA and

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,410
then you can just try it out you get

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,710
almost daily updates out of everything

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,290
sweet next question also from blue baby

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,240
bear will there be an indicator in unity

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,300
a grand app is accessing my microphone

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,040
webcam or recording my screen hmm that's

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,410
interesting i'm not i've not seen any

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,110
indicators that do that third party ones

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,700
I've seen ones that tell you when you

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,020
know your caps lock is all or something

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,580
like that which is useful for laptops

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,800
like mine where there's no light on the

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,410
caps lock key now that's an interesting

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,830
suggestion yeah there's and there's a

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,770
buck report for it and I can't remember

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,770
what

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,949
the state of it is but this is being

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,810
considered making up one of the trip one

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,460
of the tricky things about this one one

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,780
reason why people like to have control

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,190
over that is obviously the privacy they

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,800
don't want something recording them when

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,330
you know they don't want them to or the

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,729
web cam being used when they don't want

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,789
to and it's a bit tricky because having

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:02,009
an indicator and just means you've got a

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,500
piece of software that sits there and if

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,970
your machine has been compromised and

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,710
it's using your webcam without your

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,030
knowledge then it could potentially

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,860
suppress the indicator as well so I

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,190
while it might be useful for some use

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,509
cases I'm not sure it's useful for all

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,789
but yeah interesting I don't have not

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,889
seen that bug report but I'm sure

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:27,330
someone in the chat will look it up and

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:30,120
next question I will a bun to you with

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,479
unity 8 and snappy eventually lead in a

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,569
rolling release on the desktop what do

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:40,740
you think Daniel the Infinity depends

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:44,310
what you're after if you're after you

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,219
know up-to-date leave applications so

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,880
stuff that other packages don't depend

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:54,389
on I think them that's very much going

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,969
to be like it for example we've seen

00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,120
interest from from the VLC people like

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,120
they are maintaining a snap now and for

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,490
them it it's perfect they could even

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,409
hook it up with with their CIS or

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,810
whatever they release something you

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:13,740
automatically they publish a new version

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,509
in the store and I could imagine that

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,289
we're going to see more and more of that

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:21,120
so we're actually very close already so

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:26,669
this this doesn't even depend on on

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,919
unity aid that's a separate topic yeah I

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,399
think I think it's kind of getting close

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,969
to being possible to be rolling if you

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,700
want it to be like you still can run a

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,909
traditional stable you know things don't

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,979
change every day kind of and yeah I

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,390
change I don't you break but you know

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,490
just things don't get updated all the

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,550
time you can still do that with the

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,089
classic debian desktop and and even you

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,009
pretend

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,499
we could with a snappy based desktop if

00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,089
you stick to stable channels because we

00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:59,759
have a concept of channels where you can

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:02,309
choose just subscribe to stable updates

00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,439
only or you can choose something less

00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:07,829
stable something that may be updates

00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:10,910
daily or maybe more frequently and so I

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,680
think it's possible to get close to a

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,110
rolling style release with snappy in and

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,800
unity a yes but I don't think it would

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:23,579
be like the default for everyone right

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,649
yes Ellen said you can use channels so

00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:30,689
for example if you were interested in

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:32,730
let's say the from from from get

00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:37,079
and you could just use the their edge

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:40,170
channel and the nice thing is that even

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,829
if the newer should depend on a

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:46,889
very recent gtk arg hip they can just

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:48,959
bundle it for Ford a snap and it doesn't

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,439
break everything else so just in case

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,679
there's an issue somewhere that's that's

00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:59,819
not a problem so I think snappy with the

00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:02,670
concept of of bundling libraries gets

00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:04,290
rolling right because you don't want the

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,870
crack of the day for everything like

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:10,589
right yeah and even if you did choose

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,300
one-day to try out give you know I mean

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,220
we using give as an example but it could

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,870
be anything you know firefox download or

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,509
whatever but if you try an application

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,939
on their edge channel and it turns out

00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:24,660
it's not for you you know it's it's the

00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:26,189
cheese has been moved too far then maybe

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,410
you could just uninstall it and

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:31,410
installed a stable one and when you run

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,300
install it's all gone it's not like

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,670
there's little bits of libraries all

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,879
over your system you uninstall the snap

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:42,149
it's gone which is really really nice

00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,459
that's a nice I think the people who

00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,929
like to have a clean system where they

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,540
know exactly what's on the system they

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:52,679
know where it is they know where it came

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,029
from people who like that and I'm or you

00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,429
know fussed about those kind of things

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,079
will appreciate the ability to you know

00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:00,360
atomically put something on their system

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,690
and if they don't want it atomically

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,980
remove it

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:10,600
which is cool is next question is from

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,160
blue baby bear again can we have a space

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,660
where we can ask questions without being

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,240
live on this gene like the forum thread

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,090
or something sure if you make one and

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,440
tell us where it is we'll look there

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,540
maybe we create a google doc or if you

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,150
don't like Google create a doc somewhere

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,340
else maybe use an ether pad anything you

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,350
like just get it if you've created a

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,030
bunch of questions and you know you want

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,800
to put them somewhere place them

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:38,080
somewhere give us the link and we'll

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:41,050
have a look at them ah next question if

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,480
allowed apps can access my whole home

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,940
directory wouldn't it be better if every

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,800
app gets its own folder in home and one

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,200
folder that shared between all snaps

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,450
maybe also secure file picker solution

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,220
which lets you decide which file the app

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,040
is allowed to see I'm no expert that was

00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:02,140
just a full this sounds familiar doesn't

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:06,130
it it does it because that's kind of

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:09,460
what happens when you when you so each

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,970
snap is when you install a snap it's

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,490
it's delivered to your machine has a

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,920
read-only squash FS file which gets

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,650
mounted and so you can see the files

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,790
that are in it mounted under the snap

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,820
directory off the root of your

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,440
filesystem and so you can see all the

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,080
files that are in there but in addition

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,760
to which you can have a writable area in

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,980
your home directory which is also called

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,250
snaps they'll be such home slash your

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,170
username / snap then the application

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,480
names as set pro athlete a separate

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:44,410
folder for each application which is

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,870
writable so yeah we kind of do have that

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,820
there are also interfaces that allow you

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,680
to access other parts of the system and

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,800
there will be more of those as time goes

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,200
on as requirements are known for each

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:02,320
application and set of applications to

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,940
access those things together right yeah

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,790
absolutely I wasn't quite sure how this

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,790
was going to be integrated into the UI

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,550
at some stage so the question was also

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,860
about your file picker so I I'm not

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,050
quite Shh I don't know what

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,430
solution is there yeah I know there were

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,220
some discussions about that at the

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:25,120
sprint last week about how how you

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:28,030
resolve that so that how the camera

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,070
application can save files to a location

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,550
that other applications can pick up and

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,990
how the email client can pick up the

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,250
photos that you just took with the

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,630
webcam that kind of thing I think

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,360
there's there's still someone going

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,960
discussions about how that how that will

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:49,600
play out but yes that's kind of on the

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:54,670
road map okay neck neck fish next set of

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:57,130
questions is from Simon red yeah all

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:03,730
right first one is when is that we keep

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:06,430
going to become an abuja member so yeah

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:11,910
we asked him that as well I it's up to

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:14,560
him so you know we we like everyone who

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,650
works on a bun to you if they feel it's

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,110
appropriate to apply for membership and

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,450
we don't pressure them too much to do

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,710
that but it seems like a good idea there

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,770
is a little bit of peer pressure within

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,320
the team to nudge people to become an

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,900
event remember but it is possible to

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,790
work on a bun to for a long time and

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,410
even work at canonical on a bun to you

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,660
for a long time and not being a bunting

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,790
member and it's possible and there there

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,550
are a few people who yeah I'm just never

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,260
applied for membership and David is one

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,240
of those people who spends his time

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,870
actually working rather than applying

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,640
for membership so you'd have to ask him

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:59,440
that yeah please do ask him

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,920
cool next question from salmon what is

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,390
lubuntu planning with bugged a smiley

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,800
face um I don't know what is Labonte

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,140
this sounds like a rhetorical question

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,260
that Simon knows the art to do and he's

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,290
asking if we know the altitude and I

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:23,230
don't know the answer to that you can

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:29,170
sign on the show to talk of bar none I

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:33,730
think of almost lost Daniel but everyone

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:36,910
know when it is what to do yeah I leave

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:40,450
a comment in the IRC Simon and will will

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:46,050
mention it next question from Simon what

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,050
is your stance on dropping I 386 support

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,880
what do you think about that I think you

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,800
talked about this like last week or the

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,570
week before it was a similar question it

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,980
looks like the general feedback is that

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:05,590
it's still some time to go on till there

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,480
it looks like like a few people still

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:16,180
are still running 32-bit machines and

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:18,580
but because at some stage they can say

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:25,180
on an LTS which is supported for another

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:27,760
five years I don't know like I President

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:31,090
64-bit for you know ten years or

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,830
something so yeah I mean all of my

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,430
machines i use on a regular basis a

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:39,030
64-bit except one of my servers which is

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:42,270
32-bit but as i understand it the plan

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:45,700
the current discussion is around and

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:49,150
having still keeping 32-bit server

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:53,410
packages and server images because there

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,610
are you know small VPS is small services

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,340
don't really benefit from running a

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,170
64-bit version and so it makes sense for

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,430
there to still be a 32 professional so

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,410
it only gets completely going away um

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,199
that's me you know I I think it's not a

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,029
terrible idea to move things forward

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,059
I can see why some people are upset

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,949
because you know it's the thing they run

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,049
on their system and you know when you

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:22,120
take that away that's frustrating but

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:25,539
like you say there's a link the support

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,089
on the current version which has i386

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:30,940
packages and I 386 images so it's still

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:35,470
supported for a while I don't know what

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,210
this is going to me to 32-bit

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,200
applications I mean they should still

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,760
run and stuff like wine and skype and

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,850
all that stuff ship keeps your work

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:51,399
behind on 60 so it's not too much of an

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,649
issue yeah typically when we when we

00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:55,630
deprecate something there's someone or

00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:57,820
some people allocated to figure out you

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,289
know the impact of this is and figure

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,990
out there any packages that would be

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:06,130
broken by this and no doubt that will

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:10,870
happen as we work towards removing I 386

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:14,620
images looking from you don't realize

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:22,480
this is um how much work it takes to

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:25,630
have a tip ah tens of thousands of

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,059
packages sometime just one of them

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,590
trails and others depend on it and it's

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:35,440
something intermittent and you have to

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:36,669
go in other things with me in assembly

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,860
or something and you need to figure out

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,750
how to port this like it there's so much

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,740
stuff involved you to get get it working

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:50,080
it it's just crazy yeah so and it's also

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:51,760
we understand desire to to hit list it's

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,470
also from the QA point of view you know

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,860
multiple images that you have to test

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,669
and you know if there's a fewer and

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,429
fewer and fewer people who are actually

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:05,139
using this the amount of workload in

00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,789
order to test something that's used by

00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:09,700
such a small number of people becomes

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:13,029
disproportionate and it seems like not

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,850
not worth doing so that that's a factor

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,320
as well and

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,730
squishing from Simon there's been a lot

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,400
of talk about snappy but how do I get my

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,789
hands dirty with debian stroke a buncha

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,230
packages you know all about this don't

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,940
you Daniel is it have you flushed all of

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:33,400
that information out of your hand now I

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:39,030
forgot all about it good movie no take a

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,030
look at packaging gucci.com we have a

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,640
patient and that should give you good

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,600
start and then there's the remote to

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:58,150
mailing list and an IRC channel so you

00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:01,270
can also find health care cool um Simon

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,250
is the master of leading questions next

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,539
question is what do you think of LX

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:09,190
cutie I have no opinion of it I think

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,789
it's great that it exists but I've never

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:17,049
seen it so I've never used it I can plan

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:18,100
on using it on any of my systems so good

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:27,429
that existed i'm sure there are plenty

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:31,000
people did you like it same here and the

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:35,830
new butta bug day if you go to food tube

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,570
drop em East I should move into a can

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:44,289
you read all about its today so you're a

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,210
little Poochie fan and I want to get

00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:48,789
involved or you're just generally

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,460
interested in helping out with with bugs

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:55,480
and getting started now is a good time

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:59,470
and they're also going to have on air

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:04,030
session later on it should be between 19

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,250
and 20 UTC which is just a few hour so

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,020
if you still awake at the time to get

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,190
what they have to say and I'm sure

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:15,130
they're going to tell you how to get

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,780
started cool and next question what is

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,830
going on with the code of conduct

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:23,500
revisions so I guess this is the

00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,750
question is related to comments that we

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,540
made about the coca-cola needing to be

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,370
updated for

00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,330
to explicitly define what we think is

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:41,240
acceptable behavior right right and yeah

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:44,600
there were a few comments before by MPT

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,850
if you follow thomas e easton the mayor

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,770
to burn up the discussion move on from

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,000
there we also talked about it at at the

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:56,030
unlined summit and it just takes a long

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,720
time to you I just remember when we went

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:03,200
from the code of conduct from version 12

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,370
virgin too it took ages to just to get

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:13,430
it right to you know back and that's

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:15,230
what's still happening okay uh-oh Simon

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:22,760
this is good one what IRC client do you

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:29,240
use and why so I use ur c or IRS SI and

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:33,830
i use it because i like it by using hex

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,080
Chet because I don't like you know /w

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,850
something stuff but you know plenty

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,160
clicky stuff and I just could use to be

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,380
you know to the to the keyboard findings

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:50,200
and everything they're the same except

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:54,410
gnome and accept and all the others so

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,900
yeah what I'm used to yeah the reason I

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,970
like se is because it runs in a terminal

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,440
and so I can get access to it from

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,870
anywhere which is quite nice but it's

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,030
also a bad thing because it means

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:09,970
sometimes I access IRC when I shouldn't

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:12,920
like two weeks ago I was on holiday and

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:16,220
someone pinged me on IRC and i replied

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,130
to them and it was work related and it

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:23,660
could have waited but you know i am a

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:27,290
danger to myself so yeah it's good at

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,300
mad um someone asks have you ever had

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,420
snappy popcorn it's really good I had no

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,520
idea snappy popcorn existed I've heard

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:38,000
of it somewhere work but haven't tried

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,420
it I have however many years ago had

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,720
redhat kernels which was some

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,990
promotional popcorn given away at some

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:51,230
trade show many many years ago and I

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,470
think maybe this it was even before the

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,540
bun to you existed I used to run red hat

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,600
then I ran Debbie and then I ran a bun

00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,610
too and I picked up somewhere some red

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,500
hat kernels and it was just like one of

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,510
those microwave popcorn things that had

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,280
red hat branding all over it put it in

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:12,680
the microwave and you get popcorn yeah

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,390
so yeah it's good it's a good branding

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,500
thing to have snappy popcorn so yeah

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:22,700
that's a good idea we should do that

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:26,060
next question is from clunker who asks

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:33,560
how does snappy handle a palmer and

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:38,060
selinux policies so all the other stuff

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:46,160
is integrated into napkin fine and Lefty

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:53,090
itself and you can add additional imma

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:59,020
policies in the polymer what the fight

00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:02,390
is called sorry about that but yeah you

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,160
armor is booty right now is the way to

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:12,220
to to get exceptions also to how

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:14,720
interfaces are defined and selinux is is

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,270
most talked about that the at the sprint

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,620
is well right yeah I wasn't in those

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,920
sessions but I believe there were

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:25,930
discussions about having snap work on

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,930
selinux enabled destroy yet

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:36,700
that's the answer them yep I don't know

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:43,270
where that's where that has progressed

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:47,380
yet but I'm sure it will um the next

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:51,640
agent at Haysom government with the best

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,380
in the community so last week when i was

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,000
in heidelberg i was sat next to someone

00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,539
and while they were talking to me i

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,370
couldn't stop looking at his beard so i

00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:08,080
would nominate Evan d'andrea as ty deist

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:10,360
beer in the community it's I as his

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,580
mouth was moving I'll I stopped

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,940
listening to what he was saying it was

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:24,659
just so nice yeah Evan gets my vote

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:29,230
don't have one canoe okay next question

00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,610
Danielle asks or daniel l asks a when

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,460
will you see eight me the default

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:38,200
desktop environment any chance until the

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:41,080
next the bunch of LTS so we get this

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,720
question a lot and I think mark struggle

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,909
has answered it and specifically one of

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,460
his Q&A is where he said when the

00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:50,620
community decides that it's ready so

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,520
that's the short answer is when it's

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:59,309
ready whether that will be before or

00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:08,230
after the next LTS I do not know guest

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:10,120
396 53 the 30 9650 third guest asks what

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,640
is the production time table or roadmap

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,520
the ramp-up looked like for us

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,490
accessible a bunch of phones I do not

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,380
know sorry it's a question we get a lot

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,619
on here and I just don't know about the

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:35,580
future of phones in the US

00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:37,169
at all sorry next question Andrew asks I

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,470
heard at the snappy sprint there was

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:42,869
talk of content sharing example content

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,399
shared runtimes platforms can you

00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:48,299
explain how these will work and how we

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:51,509
can expect snappy GA cute to do content

00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:55,919
sharing snaps hmmm you know much about

00:27:51,509 --> 00:28:03,809
this and so basically how it's going to

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:06,029
work is that in your when you put

00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:08,279
together basically content step I don't

00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,639
know if that's the final name for it but

00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,340
let you say it's the compact that right

00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:16,289
you you put the library in there you

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,989
know all the files it needs everything

00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:24,960
and and you you set the the the snap

00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:31,429
type to content or whatever it's going

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,429
to be cold and you can you can then

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:38,609
declare that the other snaps basically

00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:42,629
depend on this or that they need this

00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:45,299
content to be wrong so it kind of like a

00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:47,879
library snap where you could have a

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,999
common set of libraries let's say for

00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:53,309
example the elementary desktop has a

00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:56,009
bunch of elementary applications and

00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:57,840
they have something some library some

00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:00,599
components which are specific to that

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,489
application and only that application

00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,159
needs and those would be inside the snap

00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:08,249
of that application but then there might

00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,799
be a whole bunch of common libraries and

00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:13,830
features that would be used by all of

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:17,309
the applications and so that could be a

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:20,340
common content library snap the others

00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:22,859
will depend on absolutely so basically

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,149
it's going to be a snap like any other

00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:27,749
it's just going to be of a different

00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:37,049
type and and that that's all there is to

00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:38,220
it cool um next question and Nick 011 do

00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,980
you know who from the a bunch of

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,309
community not only canonical is coming

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,740
to the

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:51,360
ubuntu that Rubicon EU millions of

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:55,980
people and having in November in essen

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,139
in Germany is the next one and um I

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,779
don't know who's going because I don't

00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:03,149
think we've you know audited everyone

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:05,870
who's coming it's going to be more of a

00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:10,470
if you want to come along you come along

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:12,120
excuse me um but I know there are people

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,529
obviously who are organizing this but I

00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,369
don't know who from the community is

00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:18,840
choosing to go along however someone

00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:21,299
from the community has just replied and

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,240
said they're going so there's one to add

00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,669
to your list of people who are going you

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,210
can also take a look at Luke on dot org

00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:33,690
and then browse through the list of

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,309
upcoming pecans and then have a look at

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,139
the fish speakers who are going to be

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:40,379
there because there's quite a few

00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:44,580
already and canonical non-canonical

00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:47,549
people loads of them so and we're going

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,249
to be there as well by poking yes I'm

00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:54,389
going to be that absolutely never miss

00:30:50,249 --> 00:31:01,980
trip to Germany absolutely ah next

00:30:54,389 --> 00:31:03,889
question um html5 question could happen

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,929
to benefit from the recent layoffs at

00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:09,950
cyanogen uh well it's unfortunate that

00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:12,720
sound Jen are letting people go and

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:16,230
those people I hope they find gainful

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,149
employment or contracts somewhere soon

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,970
because it's a horrible situation to be

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:23,190
in I don't know if we're looking for

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:26,789
people who are working in the areas that

00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,619
cyanogen people working I don't know

00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:31,379
exactly what the demographic of people

00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:36,330
who've been let go from cyanogen are but

00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:38,580
our recruitment page is pretty easy to

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,129
find if you google canonical careers

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,990
you'll find it its top of the list so if

00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:45,960
you know anyone who has been let go from

00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,759
surgeon throw them the link there may be

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,789
roles there that might be interesting to

00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,789
them

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:59,559
next question Steven B asks when will

00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,340
the mx6 ubuntu edition be available

00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,300
that's a question you're going to have

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,370
to ask mazing and I don't know is the

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,170
answer again as we always say we don't

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,330
do product announcements on this Q&A

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,760
that's up to manufacturers so you'd have

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,850
to ask the manufacturer I'm afraid and

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,530
in this case there that's a major

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:23,420
product guest 3965 three asks I've

00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,059
enjoyed writing desktop applications on

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,920
the electron framework has the snappy

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,730
team considered how such JavaScript

00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,920
desktop applications could become snaps

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:38,050
you know this don't you don't know and I

00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,929
know that somebody packaged items

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:46,730
somebody else packaged what was it also

00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:54,800
something electron related it was Jamie

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:57,110
Bennett it's on his blog and there's a

00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,170
makeup did he make a part for it or was

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,320
it just like centrally packaged with one

00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:05,150
llamo I think he packaged one of them

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,900
and it's something you could probably

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:12,770
very easily reuse and I think a lot of

00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,230
these electron maps use use nodejs so we

00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:17,140
have a plug-in for that and it's quite

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,000
easy to use you can basically just go

00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,100
note packages and then specify the list

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,710
of packages you need and it will pull

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:29,030
them all in and do everything for you so

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,490
things are looking quite good and and if

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:34,340
there's anything we need to add two to

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,550
support to make your election stuff work

00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,230
just let us know yeah absolutely there's

00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,910
the best place to have a look catchy for

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:44,179
examples is a snappy playpen if you look

00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,280
on github snappy playpen and look at the

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,620
atom what I think Adam is in there I

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,780
think so I think Chris wine made the

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,400
atom one and that have a look through

00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:58,010
there and you can also join us on get er

00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,380
get a dot IM there's a snappy pipe n

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,090
chat room there if you want to continue

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,179
that conversation there

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,559
and then feel free to do so I think

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,929
there's been quite a lot of people

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,190
who've been interested in packaging up

00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,710
electron apps because there's quite a

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:16,010
lot of cool things this you know desktop

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:19,909
chat applications like slack and like

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:21,379
get ur and so I think it's it's kind of

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:25,429
a popular thing that people would want

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:27,740
to see exercised well with snappy so

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,589
yeah and get in touch with us if you

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:35,080
have any trouble and will certainly put

00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:37,760
you in the right direction Andrew asks

00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,740
as snappy is going cross distro are

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,740
tools that are a buncha prefixed

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,720
expected to be implemented / distro will

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,210
they be renamed merged into the snap

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,980
tool itself such as there is a bunch of

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,750
app launch just fedora need to implement

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:55,790
this or would it become something like

00:34:50,750 --> 00:35:01,180
Snap run I think we're going to app

00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:05,150
launch is related to unity eight and the

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:09,470
lifecycle management stuff we do on the

00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:11,300
on the phone right yeah what's the

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:16,250
what's the launcher that gets cooled by

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:18,380
wineries in snap in I think that's

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,520
that's all the stuff that comes from

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:27,109
step confine ah there it is ubuntu core

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,609
launcher Rio he's cool so yeah I don't

00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:35,210
know which package provides won't you

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:37,550
call launcher an out it's called above

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,190
the culture so I'd imagine we would need

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,290
to have something known but to you

00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,810
specific there yeah I'd not noticed that

00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:47,839
one good spot Andrew but yeah in general

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,970
we are genera sizing the names of

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,349
everything so that it's not a bunch of

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,020
specific so that it's clearly an

00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:56,270
upstream project not specifically a bunt

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,680
to obviously originated here and you

00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,800
know we drove the development for the

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,470
most part so far but it's it's certainly

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,510
if you spot any more of those

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:08,030
occurrences of them to inside a bunch of

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,430
isms I would think we probably know

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:13,369
about them but if not we should file a

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:16,210
bug and make sure that they're made more

00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:22,610
generic for other distros

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:24,700
and next question blue baby bear asks is

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,340
your possibility for canonical to make

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:32,180
react native compatible with a bunchy I

00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:35,420
have no idea what react native is saying

00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,970
you you needs a good idea and what

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,620
people did in the past was to get in

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,530
touch with her with the people who

00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,570
provide the software so still remember

00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:48,470
there was was one initiative where where

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:51,980
people mailed people from Adobe 222 hot

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:54,950
stuff to to linux and I think that's

00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:57,340
usually the the best option oh it's a

00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:05,030
JavaScript framework for building apps

00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:06,650
okay pink from facebook I look at it if

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,350
you know someone who has used it and

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,730
used it intensely then yeah it could be

00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:15,230
useful to package up and I don't know

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,300
how it needs to be made compatible with

00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,920
a Bunter probably already is because

00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,080
it's a JavaScript framework that

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:27,440
probably just runs in a year in a

00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:28,970
browser context and daniel l asks any

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,700
chance microsoft office suite will come

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,760
to a bun to by 2020 since canonical

00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,470
works with microsoft now so microsoft a

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,250
massive company they have lots of

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:44,240
divisions and we work with bits of

00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:47,510
microsoft on certain specific things so

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,660
it's it's not like you know we walk into

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,130
their offices and you know we're talking

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,750
to one set of teams and then we could

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,270
just stroll over to the microsoft office

00:37:53,750 --> 00:38:01,010
guys to start telling them what to do it

00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,900
really doesn't work like that so yeah I

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,080
know I don't know that Microsoft Office

00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,890
would work on linux it may well be you

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,750
know Microsoft seem quite Linux friendly

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,220
at the moment so maybe that will happen

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,830
I don't know but I think that probably

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:23,390
has to be driven from their side there

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:25,010
are tiny bit bigger than us t brand asks

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,880
is it possible to build a snap out of a

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:31,099
Deb which works only on 12 1404

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,869
so you've got if I understand the

00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,329
question you've got software that's in a

00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:38,000
Debian package that only works on 44 and

00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:40,250
you want to make that work on a snap

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,170
based system I think that might be

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:49,490
tricky some will work fine because there

00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:52,039
maybe they don't have many platform

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,579
dependencies but I suspect anything that

00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:58,250
depends on like lipsy or the version of

00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,440
Python or the version of anything else I

00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,500
mean I'm getting the implication by you

00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,480
saying it only works on 1404 probably

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,250
implies that you've tried it on 1604 it

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,220
doesn't work so if it doesn't work on

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:14,119
1604 chances are it won't work as a snap

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,920
on 1604 it might be possible to bundle

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,069
in whatever library it depended on in

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,500
1404 into a snap so actually you're

00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:25,309
running on the 14 0 for binary with 1400

00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:28,309
for libraries on a 1604 system that

00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:30,019
might be possible and it depends if

00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:34,339
those libraries then depend on anything

00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:36,230
that's you know only in 1404 it would be

00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:38,150
an interesting exercise to try I'll be

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,220
interested to know what it is that

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,779
doesn't work on 1604 I imagine it's some

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,759
third party thing that they haven't

00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,970
released a version of 1604 or is

00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:48,529
something unmaintained or something but

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,119
yeah give us a shout I'll be interested

00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:52,119
to know what it is and if we can help

00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:58,390
more questions incoming we have 20

00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,759
minutes left so get your questions in ah

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:05,289
Simon asks what's going on with

00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:05,289
canonical and LibreOffice

00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:11,190
it's like the most broad question I have

00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:16,890
ever seen on this Q&A I think

00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:18,360
everything's fine ah yeah I don't know I

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,030
don't know what context that question is

00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,520
let's let's say it's to do with

00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:26,580
LibreOffice snaps because that's what

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,740
we're talking about a lock yeah gun is a

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,750
comfortable guy who works on LibreOffice

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,060
and he's been making LibreOffice snaps

00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,130
and I think he's been making release

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,810
candidate ones as well so you can try

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,760
out new versions of labour office

00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,750
without messing up the version of

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,330
LibreOffice you already have installed

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,790
which is a great use case well snapped

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,350
so yes that's one good thing that's

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,350
going on with canonical and leave office

00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:55,410
next question when we having a bunch of

00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:59,070
phone in the US yes see previous

00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:01,020
question what is the something you wish

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,600
should be improved in the ubuntu phone

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:07,530
something technical not the way things

00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:12,770
work like the above question what do you

00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:21,870
think I mean um i think for me its speed

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:24,750
and hmm technical the way things worked

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:28,110
like sometimes i could just imagine like

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:30,090
a quicker workflow for things sometimes

00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:37,560
it feels like I'm tapping around quite a

00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:43,410
bit does it but I'm um yeah I'm usually

00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:46,080
happy with with any phone so I went away

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:49,920
on a road trip of the weekend and I took

00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:53,700
my trusty music gun who it is I took my

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:58,320
trusty e 4.5 with me and I had it loaded

00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,390
up with about 250 songs and we plugged

00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,440
it into the cast area in the car and

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:05,730
just set it on a shuffle play of all

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,920
these songs and it was a playlist that

00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,020
all three of the people in the car had

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,580
collaborated on so we'd all like

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,980
contributing music put it all on the

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,720
phone and then just started playing and

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,029
just let it you know played one track

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,869
after the other

00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:25,249
and we were away for three days so he

00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:28,969
started on Thursday morning and by

00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:31,429
midway through Saturday the battery on

00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:33,949
the phone was fifty percent so for like

00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:36,049
three days has it been solidly playing

00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:37,279
music so i used to say battery life but

00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:40,309
I don't think battery that's a problem

00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:42,739
for some use cases I think I'd agree i

00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:44,900
think speed i think the one thing that i

00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:47,089
know people always do when you hand them

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,140
a phone is they start swiping up and

00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,939
down with the thumb and they start

00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,349
swiping left and right and sometimes

00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:54,529
they're going through phone jitters a

00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:58,459
little bit in like scrolling in both

00:42:54,529 --> 00:43:00,709
directions so i think speed will be the

00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:03,469
ones they make it like super fast super

00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:06,789
slick that would be lovely please make

00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:06,789
that happen Daniel thank you very much

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,339
Simon asks how do I apply at canonical I

00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:15,009
assume that and there's a big grinning

00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:18,099
smiley face I assume that means

00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:20,569
career-wise and the answer is you go to

00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:23,299
your favorite search engine you type in

00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,890
canonical careers you scroll down until

00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:28,400
you find the right hit which is

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:30,409
canonical com / careers / all vacancies

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,579
or something like that you find a job

00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:40,729
you want and you press apply you fill in

00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:42,489
the form and wait next question Simon

00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:45,489
asked what email client to use and why

00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,489
Daniel

00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:51,440
using thunderbird used it for a few

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:56,720
years of sometimes using mud on the

00:43:51,440 --> 00:44:01,580
server as well but it I use gmail and

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,710
browser but if I am on a dodgy

00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,230
connection I might use mutt or if I'm

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:11,960
remote I might use mass as well I quite

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:13,460
like that what is cool when fast someone

00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,880
else what's the status of the snappy

00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:22,330
play pin is awesome a status i think it

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:25,040
is yeah yeah yep awesome is the answer

00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:27,140
if you had to choose favorite flavor

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,140
besides vanilla ubuntu what would it be

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,520
ah well what flavor out if you weren't

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,810
running a bunch of unity what would you

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:42,050
be running Daniel unity a dearth on

00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:46,340
stage ah good answer likely thinking so

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:50,000
i have ubuntu with unity on the machines

00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:56,650
the one exception is a thinkpad i have

00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,020
on my desk which i will show you this

00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,000
glorious thinkpad here runs a bunch

00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:06,590
amarte as if you couldn't tell from the

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:13,340
sticker and it say something all t40

00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:17,060
something piano x61 alright very old and

00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,500
it runs a bunch amarte perfectly so if i

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:30,560
wasn't relevant to you with unity i

00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:35,720
would probably run Marty what's next and

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:38,420
we want to know in which rooms we are so

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:45,110
I'm in a co-working space and this is

00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:49,040
the small conference room with two

00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:50,660
exciting very small quiet since people

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,390
next door they all chatting on the phone

00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:57,590
off no organizing stuff so that's why

00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:59,680
I'm sitting here awesome and do I risk

00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:04,849
lifting up my laps of the way

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:07,700
I'm in my den which is also my kids

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:09,680
playroom so there's mess everywhere so

00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,839
I'm instead going to point out the

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,700
window and say look I've got sunlight

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,900
coming in through the window and that's

00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:20,270
as far as you can create chaos the funny

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,359
red so there's a there's a picture

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,099
cartoon I've seen where someone talks

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,800
about cleaning their room and they

00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:30,079
create a cone of clean out from there

00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,940
like everything's pushed like they're so

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,599
everything you see here is fine anything

00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:41,630
just there there and there is not back

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:42,920
for this room right now Simon asks have

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:49,130
you have you used any other UNIX

00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:52,609
distribution I have so in a previous job

00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:55,910
I used to use red hat linux and because

00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:57,800
they were I was administering giant SI p

00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,280
systems and they were running with

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,660
oracle and red hat linux I couldn't tell

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,170
you what version of Red Hat it was a

00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:11,930
long time ago um and in another customer

00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:14,359
i was using IBM AIX on their big big big

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:19,010
big systems that whatever they called

00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:21,440
the beam but IBM boxes one of his lame

00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:25,520
friends not mainframes they were like

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:29,299
just giant like not own a big things and

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,849
that was AIX and I used hp-ux as well

00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:36,470
and I think that's all of them i don't

00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:38,960
use any others my view scholar unix for

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:42,200
like five minutes but i did wash my

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,339
hands afterwards so that's okay what are

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,480
you doing a few like in university there

00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:50,780
were a few machines where we had

00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,420
accounts and i can't remember what they

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:57,079
were running i remember that at some

00:47:53,420 --> 00:48:01,970
stage i tried to install one or two

00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:05,510
different bsp but that's about it yeah i

00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:08,240
think i might try to BST yeah but didn't

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:11,770
really get on with it in that when i was

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,519
at college the computers i had were and

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,959
they were

00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,989
your system which is no longer around

00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:19,069
and it was called prime and the

00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:22,099
operating system when it was called

00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:27,249
primer less and if you ever google it

00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:27,249
its pr1ma prime with one in the middle

00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:40,069
yeah that was good fun gosh oh my age

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:42,890
now move on what's next it's michael are

00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:45,799
asking it's a list of correspondence

00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:49,669
between sdk version and OTA for example

00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:55,849
as he gave 1504 but for corresponding to

00:48:49,669 --> 00:48:59,179
OTA 11 i seem to remember there was some

00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:02,929
spreadsheets somewhere that was linked

00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:05,569
to from somewhere I'm developer who to

00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:07,999
come but I can't remember off the top of

00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:09,949
my head where it is I don't think I've

00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:14,809
seen anything that correlates those two

00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:18,229
all I've ever seen is like well no I I

00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:21,049
haven't seen anything that answers the

00:49:18,229 --> 00:49:23,439
question that you're asking now it would

00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:25,849
be nice if we had such a thing angry

00:49:23,439 --> 00:49:29,779
maybe putting it up on the Bluetooth

00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:31,519
dash appt thurs devel mailing list and I

00:49:29,779 --> 00:49:35,779
think we really should have something

00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:39,319
like this yeah 10 minutes left so get

00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:43,249
your questions in we often run out of

00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:45,769
time brother running out questions CID

00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:51,559
asks what is still to be done in unity 8

00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:54,919
to become the default oh gosh well you

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:56,899
tell us try running it and use it as

00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:58,699
your daily driver and look for the

00:49:56,899 --> 00:50:02,899
things that are missing and let us know

00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:04,549
what it is that's missing because you

00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:06,619
know we know about some things like you

00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:09,789
know certain bet window behaviors and

00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:12,169
another typical use cases of a desktop

00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:13,999
but there might be things that you know

00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:16,789
you do on a regular basis that don't

00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:19,189
work in ut 8 or what weirdly or you know

00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:20,989
I'll just plain broken so really I would

00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:23,649
say now is a good time start testing

00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:27,400
unity eight you can actually install

00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:29,859
xenia lore yakety and log into a

00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,900
t8 session so you don't have to

00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:34,029
completely destroy a machine in order to

00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,609
use unity a you can just install them to

00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:41,740
log into a unity 8 session and then use

00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:43,960
unity 8 you know for a day and record

00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:46,960
your experiences and yeah write a blog

00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,329
about it or write it up as a you know

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,180
some kind of document somewhere and

00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:55,270
share that with us and we can learn from

00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:59,740
that yeah and if you want to file bugs

00:50:55,270 --> 00:51:02,859
you can use the unity ate fish desktop

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,369
tech business but it's useful for best

00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:10,510
reviews of 58 and maybe your body's

00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:12,869
already filed like they're quite a few

00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:19,119
known issues and they're being worked on

00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:21,460
cool ah Nick 011 asks what do you think

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:26,650
about the new iphone with no headphone

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:29,500
jack kind of reminds me of when i first

00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,809
bought a laptop that had no serial port

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,549
on it and I thought oh my god this is

00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:35,430
ludicrous how am I ever going to work

00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:39,369
with a laptop without serial port and

00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:41,829
then i bought a USB serial dongle and i

00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:44,619
use that and then over time I just

00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:46,930
stopped using it because there's nothing

00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:49,900
I ever connected it has a serial port on

00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:51,339
it anymore so it's one of those here

00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,400
it's the uncomfortable transition

00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:56,740
between the older than you and sometimes

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,369
you need an adapter after a while

00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,950
everyone forgets about it like you know

00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:06,220
before there was USB there were parallel

00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:08,829
ports and serial ports and CGA ports and

00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,539
you know all this kind of stuff things

00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:13,260
move on I think people get far too upset

00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:16,710
about changing its changing connectors

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,710
stuff changes

00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:26,640
and also it's an iphone so i don't care

00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,140
um sid also asks there have been talks

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,000
about the possibility of creating your

00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,950
own aggregator scope while you're on the

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,390
phone just dragging that service you

00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,890
want combined what's the state's let

00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:38,250
this neat feature i would love to

00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:41,330
customize some scopes myself hmm not

00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:44,160
heard about this feature you need them

00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:50,010
one for David Calais I think he knows

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:51,840
about these things ah other question

00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:57,060
yeah let's just skip that pretend that

00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,580
never happened next question Steven B

00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:04,110
what features are you excited about for

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:11,190
the 16 10 release so I I'm quite

00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:14,220
interested in unity 8 in 1610 and

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:17,940
testing that and using it more robustly

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:20,700
I try and stick to the LTS releases on

00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,340
my own main laptop all the time and then

00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,980
at some point in the cycle some shiny

00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,230
thing makes me decide to upgrade and

00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,330
then you know maybe later I regret it

00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:33,060
and reinstall back to the LTS because i

00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:36,720
like the stability LTS fine I'm really

00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:38,700
looking forward to trying unity 8 on

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,820
something more powerful than an

00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:44,310
arm-based phone I want I want to I want

00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,130
to actually use it productively on a you

00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:49,260
know core i7 with loads of RAM to see

00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,700
how it works with a normal death as a

00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,030
normal desktop environment rather than

00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:56,960
just a phone UI and I realize I can

00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:59,940
already do that in 1604 but obviously

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,180
1610 will have newer stuff so that's

00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,180
good

00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:13,660
next question CID asks cheers back never

00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:16,029
talks about the inability for messaging

00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,940
GPS app telegram etc drawn in the

00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:20,339
background canonical want to provide

00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,670
services for these kinds of things

00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:26,829
what's the status about this so there

00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:30,900
were a big list of use cases that were

00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:33,279
compiled and as I understand it and the

00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,470
person responsible the architect of

00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:37,720
these things Thomas boss is working

00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:42,369
through each of those use cases one by

00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:54,730
one picking the most important ones at

00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:56,740
the top any more questions same we want

00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:04,359
to know what a typical work day looks

00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:06,849
like for us it looks like a terminal

00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:09,700
window with IRC in it i looks like a

00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:15,400
browser with loads of Google Docs and

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:20,349
Trello and email and hanging else is

00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:24,789
what it looks like for me yeah it's very

00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:28,660
similar here usually the text editors as

00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:31,240
well some build running somewhere stuff

00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:34,809
in the calendar but what I really like

00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:38,049
about my job is that not every day is

00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:41,140
the same like there's always crazy new

00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:43,270
stuff coming in or there's some conflict

00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,849
somewhere you talk to somebody on the

00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:48,490
phone or you organise something else or

00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:51,369
do something completely new like I don't

00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,950
know write a document where you the

00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:55,779
terms of entry for some contests are

00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,760
defined and then talk to the legal team

00:55:55,779 --> 00:56:00,250
about it and you know think about stuff

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,099
you never thought about so it every day

00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,839
is it's different somehow is the tool

00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:06,849
they use the same but the way we use

00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:15,839
them are very different every day yeah

00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:15,839
absolutely um I lost where we are um

00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:23,010
Nick asked is there anyone who has more

00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:25,570
phones than popy and are they sit proof

00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:29,290
yeah I learned not to put phones in my

00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:33,100
back pocket after the great mx4

00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:37,060
explosion buttock explosion of last year

00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:39,220
so yeah I I don't do that I don't have

00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:42,660
that many phones I don't think he says

00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:52,750
looking at six on his desk but yeah I

00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:54,460
like phones ah what's next let me wants

00:56:52,750 --> 00:57:02,710
to know about current affairs but I

00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:05,410
guess we can skip that one yes um Hannah

00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,240
Nene asks why isn't the miracast ether

00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:11,710
cast going to be implemented in the BQ

00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:14,730
aquarius see 4.5 so for those you don't

00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:18,700
know this is a feature in the pro 5

00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:24,340
which you can press a button and stream

00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:27,310
your desktop to an hdmi dongle and it

00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,320
works pretty well on this and it doesn't

00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,690
work on any of the previous devices and

00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:38,200
I I believe there's two reasons for that

00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:41,550
um one is it's quite cpu intensive to do

00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:45,310
and so this being quite a powerful phone

00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:47,110
it can cope whereas the e 4.5 is a

00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:50,080
significantly less powerful clone and

00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:53,260
probably wouldn't cope but i think the

00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,330
other reason is that some of the some of

00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,880
the underlying components that use

00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,800
depend on a newer version of the colonel

00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:04,510
a newer version of android kernel that

00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:07,930
we use which the BQ and the mx4 don't

00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:10,270
have and they would require back porting

00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,710
a whole lot of stuff I think Simon the

00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,450
guy who worked on this has provided all

00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,900
the patches so if someone wanted to try

00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:19,030
and do this or create a new version of

00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,410
Android kernel for the bqe 4.5 that

00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:25,119
could possibly bring the two together

00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:27,999
and but I don't I don't term

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,579
I don't foresee that happening anytime

00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:36,490
soon unless some community person gets

00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:38,410
on board with that ah Mary a grip says

00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,059
it's not the colonel it's the newer

00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:43,150
version of the Android how I knew he

00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:49,720
would know so they go it's something

00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:52,630
Android he hand wavy bits in android so

00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,519
we've exhausted all the questions and a

00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,769
