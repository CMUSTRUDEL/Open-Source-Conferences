hello everyone and welcome to marks Q&A

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,519
here at the ubuntu online summit if

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,139
you're familiar with these then i

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,000
probably don't need to tell you but if

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,610
you're new the way this works is we're

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,789
going to take questions over IRC we are

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,340
in the channel hasha bunt to hyphen u OS

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,020
hyphen plenary you start your word

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,029
question in all capital letters and

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,580
we'll get a nice highlight and we're

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,119
going to pick them out and ask them of

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,309
mark as we get through them but first

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,980
Marcus got some slides that he wanted to

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,719
share with us yes hello everybody it's

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,440
great to be back looking for to your

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,280
questions and fire away on IRC let me

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,520
just kick this off as a preliminary

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,100
couple of thoughts on where we're at and

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,539
what's kicking around I hope your online

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,210
somebody's going really well I was at

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,090
the OpenStack summit last week of course

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,399
the sex somebody essentially in many

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,800
senses was an outgrowth of the old

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,640
ubuntu developer summit the in-person

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,250
summit and there are clearly growing

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,630
pains growth pains at the OpenStack

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,909
summits just in terms of their ability

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,619
to handle the number of parallel

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,439
conversations in the detail of those

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,600
conversations and balance you know the

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,600
number of voices around the table and so

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,210
on so I was arguing quite strongly in

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,799
favor of OpenStack following Ubuntu

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,299
again online and adopting this kind of

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,920
virtual format which I think leads to

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,320
more thoughtful participation in the

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,700
right topics by the right people so I

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,630
hope you're having a good week and I'm

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,290
very happy to join you um Michael do you

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,259
have do you have that shared screen up

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,000
yep it should be great all right so

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,860
first of all congratulations everybody

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,450
on what I think is not standing LTS

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,280
release 1604 and I say that I think from

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,969
both perspectives as I look at around

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,070
the community I think there are lots of

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,320
communities parts of ubuntu that really

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,680
put effort into 1604 i think people

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,050
realize that the LTS releases are what

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,090
everybody else actually uses on in the

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,860
long term and so they're a great

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,970
opportunity to get your stuff

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,500
baked and celebrated and adopted so I

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,670
want to celebrate a bunch of the new

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,430
teams that came in and did that work and

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,230
the gun to meet community i think is has

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,220
done an outstanding job and is a great

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,700
example of new innovation and energy in

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,350
ubuntu but again I think all of the

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,900
flavors really took advantage of the

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,350
1604 from the canonical expected

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,330
perspective we were super proud to get

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,050
the various two-pointers mass to point o

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,150
Lex d 2 point 0 g g 2 point 0 into 1604

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,540
we're still shaking out i think all of

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,010
the kinks up to the point 1 release

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,459
which is where we we typically see

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,560
adoption accelerate so for everybody

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,940
who's who's part of that let's keep our

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,160
heads down sr Ewing and addressing

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,310
issues in the LTS through to the point

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,130
release and and and congratulations

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,180
again on that I want to welcome the new

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,880
tech board thank you to the developers

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:25,410
for participating in that election it's

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,880
a tremendous testament I think to the

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,700
importance of the project that we have

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,010
such thoughtful and insightful people

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,959
who put themselves forward for for that

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,100
process I want to thank everybody who

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,799
stood it was a great a shortlist

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,670
effectively of candidates and I want to

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,310
thank the folks who stepped down at the

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,739
at the end of their terms I couldn't be

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,299
more confident in the quality of

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,150
thinking and the quality of the

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:59,190
discussion and the decisiveness of that

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,540
group we continue to grow and I'm very

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,150
excited that we're starting the cycle

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,010
with with new projects out there that

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,640
are thinking about joining a bun tube

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,290
is fun and exciting and fresh and I bet

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,870
there'll be more I want to double down

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,959
on the invitation to folks to to join 12

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,269
and express your individual ideas about

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,970
what limits should be about under this

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,800
banner and if there's anything we can do

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,900
to support that either at the community

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,030
council level or the tech board level or

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,169
from canonical side of things please and

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:34,210
feel free to ask so two big things

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,580
changed in 1604 from the point of view

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,220
of every single instance of 1604 every

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,320
desktop every laptop every vm and one of

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,710
them is this is snappy now we are just

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,150
at the beginning of the snappy journey

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,530
we're just starting to see what people

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,750
will do with snaps I don't want to over

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,270
promise but I do think they are a very

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,520
important new primitive there a way to

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,720
essentially deliver a complete set of

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,030
software with all of its dependencies

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
and you can think about that lots of

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,389
different ways you can think about that

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,130
as a great new mechanism to deliver apps

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,260
to the desktop you can do think of that

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,270
as a great new mechanism to deliver apps

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,310
to the cloud you can think if there's a

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,010
great new way to just to deliver content

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,870
you know your your website to your web

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,300
servers effectively could be delivered

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,340
as a snap and there's still a lot of

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,500
work to be done but I'm super proud of

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,740
how these first pieces have shaken out

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,860
in 1604 we got real transaction ality we

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,020
got real performance in the way these

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,550
you know updates and upgrades happen

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,080
because of the way we're doing it I

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,820
think you'll see that lots of other

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,639
distros are going to follow and we

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,669
really see signs of of other groups that

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,190
are sort of have made similar outline

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:48,370
similar goals now starting to follow the

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,960
way we're doing snaps it's kind of a

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,280
pity that we will continue to see

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,289
fragmentation but I think that's

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,280
inevitable that's human nature and I'm

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,960
quite proud of the fact that we're

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,760
confidently eating and quite proud of

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,789
the way we are leading all of that

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,970
anyway that's a long way of saying have

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:06,610
fun with snappy snap craft which is the

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,990
build tool and it's super easy and super

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,570
user useful and there's a nice ecosystem

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,780
forming of parts what we call parts

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,360
which are essentially source code that's

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,750
been described well enough that you can

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,950
easily

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,930
call it into your snap the last thing I

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,160
want to talk about is Lex d I hope you

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,600
guys are playing with it and having fun

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,090
with it it is the world's fastest

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,560
hypervisor and you'd be pretty amazed at

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,710
who's using it and how they're using it

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,050
but I think this is going to be the new

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,090
hypervisor that makes a big difference

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,160
on your laptop it gives you essentially

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,290
a child on your laptop pretty much as

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,980
many little machines as you want of any

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,630
Linux flavor and very fast and and in

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,120
large-scale environments it essentially

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,880
is a new way to think about OpenStack or

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,150
visa sphere or docker essentially like

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,710
operating at scale so that's it i hope

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:05,110
we have some good questions flowing in

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,430
and with that Michael back to you all

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,650
right it does look like we've had a

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,150
whole bunch of questions come in so keep

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,760
asking them and we will get through as

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,870
many of them as we can the first one is

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,480
from Aurora Avenue who's asking says at

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,310
leweb you said that microstates like the

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,950
isle of man could lead the way in cloud

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,340
storage legislation what did you mean by

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,620
this exactly well I think we have a real

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,250
interesting set of questions in society

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,580
about data access to data and governance

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,580
of data and I think in the smaller

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,210
states it's easier to set principled

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:46,810
positions in that regard and so for

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,720
example I think there is a set of rules

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,419
out there which everybody would consider

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,270
our fair and reasonable governing for

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,820
example how authorities can get access

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:01,360
to private data how they get access to a

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,919
company data and so on and I think it

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,140
would be dangerous just to take a

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,470
black-and-white view of that to say you

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,810
know private data is totally private

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,080
sorry corporate data is totally private

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,060
and but I also think you know in some of

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,669
the larger jurisdictions in the world in

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,620
the u.s. in particular and there are

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:23,080
there appear to be lots of ways where

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,870
data can be grabbed in ways that i think

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,669
are unacceptable i would like to see

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,220
countries taking a position on that

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,630
trying to find that middle line and i

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,430
think smaller countries in smaller

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,760
countries it's easy for them easier for

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,780
them

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,020
to to be thoughtful about that and so

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,790
while we haven't seen it yet I do think

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,600
it's a hot topic there has just been a

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:48,040
data protection sort of a bunch of data

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,020
protection work that's landed from the

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,290
European Commission I'm a big fan of

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,510
Europe and I think that will be an

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,000
important body of work but but but being

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:02,050
large they go slower than some of the

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,260
smaller countries possibly can go all

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,510
right next one is from MacPhail says

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,400
congratulations on making it but to an

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,950
innovative and exciting platform for

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,130
development is there a plan to fully and

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,890
comprehensively document the SDK mirror

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,440
and snappy just now the documentation is

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,430
not as good as computing products yes I

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,110
think that's fair comment and the the

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,410
focus for us in the push to 1604 has

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,720
been to get the basics in place and I'm

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,130
very I think it's great feedback that

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,500
the documentation doesn't reflect

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,380
everything that's there and now I think

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,550
we need to go a little slower and

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,340
because we're in a stable release that's

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,300
natural and we need to do a better job

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,430
of documenting those pieces and I hope

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,490
that the SDK team is doing a good job of

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,260
that Michael maybe you can comment but i

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,510
definitely understand that the snappy

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,030
guys have been kind of flat flat out

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,330
trying to get to the 1604 milestone and

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:04,930
we can expect them to go more carefully

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,660
and slowly going forward yeah we are

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,990
keeping up on the SDK documentation

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,850
pretty well the toolkits behind that and

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,680
the services are evolving pretty fast

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,120
still so it's a constant game of

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,910
catch-up all right the next one is from

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,010
yon says do you see a bunt to four

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,600
phones entering the conventional retail

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:29,860
space like brick and mortar stores

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,420
within the next 12 months I don't want

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,640
to comment on timelines we do see it

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,090
getting there and we're also pretty

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,370
focused on on slowly expanding the set

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,250
of hands to which 12 is easily available

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,340
because we know that we're on a on a

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,050
curve and as we as we move up that curve

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,510
in terms of the completeness and the fit

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,580
and finish

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,550
polish of the experience and of the

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,650
product it becomes relevant for a wider

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,600
audience so so there's always a

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,860
temptation to sort of go you know

00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,480
straight for the moon shot but the

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,430
problem is if you miss a moonshot it's

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,020
pretty fatal so we know for example that

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,640
there are carriers who want to put us in

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,070
retail stores and some pretty big

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,750
markets we've actually held back from

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,240
that specifically because we don't think

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:18,280
the product is ready for that level of

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,530
audience right now my focus is on

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,050
generalizing the phone and tablet

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,390
experience into a PC experience so that

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,670
I and you and many of us can actually

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,320
run unity 8 on our desktops we weren't

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,300
exactly the same code that you would get

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,820
on a phone or a tablet but we're really

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,320
exercising the desktop experience we're

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,210
not quite there yet i'm waiting for the

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,950
signal from the desktop team to say that

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:45,890
it's it's it's good enough for you know

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,360
the advance guard to arrive and the

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,410
reason that's my focus is just because

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,680
there are so many more of us who use

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,280
linux on a open linux on a on a laptop

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,960
that are going to use it on on a phone

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,930
the next step from there is to get to a

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,730
an all snap version of that laptop and

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,580
that has some real benefits at that

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,710
point we really have a much better

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,710
handle on security because we won't need

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,870
X or we'll be putting X in a box and so

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:16,220
you know it goes in the same box as the

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,440
app that it came with and and and then I

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,840
think we can make that final push to

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,280
full retail exposure because we have a

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,840
really great convergence story would

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,060
have a really great security story will

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,620
have a really great update story and I

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,900
think we'll have something that you know

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,640
it's pretty unique in the world now that

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,860
may sound like a sort of very measured

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,630
process but I think it's important for

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,070
us to do this carefully right you don't

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,440
have to look very far to find people

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,440
who've aimed too high and fallen flat

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,090
all right so kind of along the same

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,580
veins we've got two different questions

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,530
once asking where you see the bun 25

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,570
years from now and the other is what

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,800
major technological innovations are you

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,930
hoping to see in the next 10 years sure

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,750
what at the moment I think we see three

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:07,910
pretty distinct

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:09,680
fields of computing we see the personal

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,320
computing which is initially defined by

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,900
the pc then mobile we think that's going

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,550
to converge we see cloud computing which

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,430
is pretty much the evolution of the data

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,350
center and then we see this new field

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,690
emerging which is you can call it the

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,510
distributed cloud it's more like a

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,610
million pieces of glass and you know

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,410
think of all the boxes on the wall

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,540
controlling your lighting controlling

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,770
air conditioning controlling the network

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,980
access to the network top-of-rack

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,280
switches all the way through to home

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,260
security robot drones soft driving cars

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,240
and so on in a sense each of those

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,520
things is a little server a little linux

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,870
server but the tricky thing about them

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,850
is they're not all in one data center

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,410
being managed professionally they're

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,360
there they're spread out all over the

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,330
world and that's that new thing that

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,160
people call IOT I'm not sure exactly

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,830
what the right label for it is so three

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,810
big domains of computing right now about

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,430
two-thirds of cloud computing runs

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,320
ubuntu and i think that's great you know

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,970
I think it's that's a healthy situation

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,500
I think there's a there's a lead

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,760
platform that everybody knows and then

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,740
there's other platforms that people

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,910
sometimes have reason to use and I think

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,520
that's great that's competition that's

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:21,980
healthy I think we can achieve the same

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,330
two-thirds leadership in IOT right and

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,330
that's an incredible thing that's that's

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,339
the new big wave of computing that's

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,290
essentially thinking about making your

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,630
home Reuters software defined as a

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,610
snappy device making your top of X which

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,640
software defined as a snappy switch we

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:41,000
run apps making Wi-Fi access points and

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,130
all sorts of robots and drones and cars

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,230
and things like that into snappy devices

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,940
that you can build software for and you

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,500
can manage much more easily than you

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,990
currently can manage the firmware on

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,300
that class of stuff right so I think

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,040
that's a huge focus for us right now I'm

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,320
pretty sure that in five years time will

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,460
be two-thirds of that market which is

00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
great it's great for a bunch of

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,300
developers they'll be able to write new

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,560
apps for that whole class of things just

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,900
as easy as they write apps to the cloud

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,089
today and then personal computing well

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,630
that's a wild card I don't think a boom

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:14,060
to on the phone is going to you know be

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,170
a lead product just because their phone

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,540
market is already done

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,029
mind right but i do think personal

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,260
computing will be disrupted again and if

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,519
we're lucky if we in the right place at

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,680
the right time with the right community

00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,350
then and we have that convergence story

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,329
behind us then I think we could be the

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,190
lead for the next wave of personal

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,600
computing just exactly what that might

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,490
be I don't want to speculate about right

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,910
now because because my focus is on the

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,230
the the IOT side of things but but

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,730
that's why I think it's important for us

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,680
to get the convergence piece right and

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:47,800
stay in personal computing because it

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:50,810
will be disrupted once again all right

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,089
area is asking where we see Ubuntu

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,310
Software Center rebuild to allow snappy

00:15:53,089 --> 00:16:00,380
and also things like Google Chrome and

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:03,199
paid apps very simply yes we want to

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,339
have a single front end to all of the

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,010
different ways you can get apps

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,170
effectively from from the Ubuntu

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,560
community from canonical from from third

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,320
parties and the software center is

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,279
supposed to be that central GUI to do it

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,810
and the the shift to using kinoma

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,660
software to being aligned with Cano

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,190
software i think was helpful it's

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,980
obviously not a perfect piece of

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,079
software but we I think was a useful

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,940
shift to keep us focused on the key

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,949
things that we need to get right all

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,709
right the next one is from Chloe Wolfie

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,750
girl she's asking what do you think

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:45,800
about the HUD and how would you like it

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,180
to be integrated into unity 8 that's a

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,519
super interesting question i think i

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,980
think the HUD remains a really

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,540
interesting piece of conceptual work

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,930
right how do you get access to rich

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,019
functionality without having to point a

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,110
clicky your way through a complex set of

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:05,000
set of menus as I look around the sort

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,069
of world of personal computing we see a

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,709
lot of people thinking about natural

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,390
language interfaces right and the HUD I

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,549
think fits into that realm of things

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,100
it's trying to find a more human and

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:18,350
direct imperative way of getting access

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,459
to stuff right now it's not a top

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,439
priority for me I think we have other

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,270
things that we need to clean up in unity

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,429
eight in the convergence story if you

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,880
have ideas on that then then then crack

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:31,760
on and I'd like to see what people do

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,350
all right Amara wants to know how you

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:39,380
plan on topping this year's MWC haha we

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,670
did have an incredible mwc and and we

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,740
saw that on all fronts you know we are

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:46,820
stand kind of had phones and tablets

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,530
down the one side of it it had cloud and

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,550
cloud infrastructure down that the other

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,260
side of it and then I OT and if you

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,900
think of just put yourself in the shoes

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,080
of your national telco your let your

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,940
your local telco and while the very sort

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,890
of visible part of that telco is the

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,180
phone and everyone sort of says well you

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,410
know the phone and a bunch of on the

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,090
phone is interesting and important how

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,380
you doing bear I just want you to think

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,010
about the rest of that infrastructure

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,560
for a while most telcos are moving their

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,500
data centers like their exchanges and

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,180
their core data centers to be clouds in

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,500
almost all of them are building those

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:30,050
clouds on ubuntu deutsche telekom AT&T

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:32,120
NTT bell canada verizon you name em

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,700
they're moving to a bun to for those

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,160
clouds so that's the heart of the telco

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,930
and then think about all of the edge

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,060
pieces of infrastructure all the towers

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,370
the cell phone towers that stuff driving

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,700
those antennas the top of racks which is

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,580
the rooters the the dsl gateways the

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,220
home gateways there were more of those

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,140
than there are phones and many of those

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,750
i think we'll move to snappy right to a

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,340
bun to again and then there's that last

00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,780
piece of that infrastructure the human

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,750
piece the personal computing side of

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,130
things i think we could do something

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,290
really interesting there but i just want

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,870
you to appreciate for a minute just how

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,940
much of that telco picture now ubuntu is

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,860
really relevant for and how exciting

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,830
that is for them for us for the

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,530
developer community and for people who

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,910
work in that industry and so that was

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,010
pretty exciting what could we do next

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,020
year that my top it and while i

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,180
definitely think we'll see huge growth

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,490
in the iot side of things it's the hot

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,840
thing ubuntu is there and it's the right

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,140
platform and so then everybody's using

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,360
to innovate and i think we'll see more

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,460
and more real production stories of

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,760
people with millions of robots or cars

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,350
or drones or GSM base stations or

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,980
software-defined radios at one form or

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,470
another

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,539
and that will sort of go from the proof

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,090
of concept phase to the real in

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,460
production of scale phase and who knows

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,139
what happens on personal computing like

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,259
I said we do have folks who want to put

00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:59,999
us in the retail store and we just want

00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:04,759
to be thoughtful about when the product

00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:04,759
is ready for that widespread visibility

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,129
all right area again says the content of

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,470
your recent talks and interviews seem to

00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:15,990
be largely focused on cloud and server

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,700
computing are you still as passionate

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,409
about Ubuntu in the personal computing

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,799
space as you were when you started the

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:26,970
project yes I think for two reasons

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,470
first you know we can we can joke about

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,399
the one percent right when most people

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,389
talk about the one percent they mean

00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,309
something different but when I talk

00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:34,169
about the one percent I mean people who

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,119
are passionate about free software on

00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,409
their personal devices and I think

00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,869
that's an enormously important audience

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:41,639
right whether you come to that because

00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:43,740
of security whether you come to that

00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,330
because of economics whether you come to

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,369
that because of freedom whether you come

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,460
to that because you're a developer and

00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:51,990
that's what you want to use every day

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,840
you're a VIP as far as I'm concerned

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:59,029
right I have been incredibly lucky in

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,409
life in no small part because of the

00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:03,389
activities of a huge community of people

00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,519
who work on free software every day and

00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:07,559
so kind of making sure that we have a

00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,830
great personal computing story for them

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,809
is I think an important thing for me to

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,610
do and there are other people at

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,820
canonical and in the able to community

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,649
to share that mission and so we work

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,919
together to get it done that hasn't

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:24,779
changed at all there is that outside

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,730
chance that we could be part of the next

00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,860
wave of personal computing and actually

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,320
move right to the mainstream but that's

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,970
only part of my motivation for for for

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,590
being there that explains unity eight

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,809
right I'd really do believe that the

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,759
future of personal computing is fully

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,889
converged and nobody else is going to

00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,499
build that as free software unless we

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:46,470
build it as free software so controversy

00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:48,389
be damned that's what we're doing but I

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,889
am delighted that a bun to creates a

00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:52,950
forum for all the different desktop

00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:55,610
environments to do their thing and do it

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,260
in a way that end users can consume and

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,500
will I have insecurities I think that's

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,360
important I have been talking a lot

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,400
about cloud and infrastructure because

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,340
it is important right it's important

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,440
that if you want a bun to to have a

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,600
future there has to be a sustainable

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,090
story around that and right now it's

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,980
it's pretty exciting in that regard to

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,470
see the level of adoption of a bun to

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,020
inside every day businesses began small

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,120
and in particular that's being driven by

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,570
the move to cloud computing both on the

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,190
public cloud and and with OpenStack and

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,270
and other private cloud infrastructures

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,890
so that's why I'm excited about it I

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,600
think it's important to us I think we

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,370
are defining the state of the art and if

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,490
you look at you jus if you look at the

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,190
XD I think these are critical primitives

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,390
for large-scale computer and they

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,890
wouldn't happen if it wasn't for

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,020
canonical it wasn't for the ability of

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,000
community if it wasn't for me kind of

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,970
you know being willing to get out in

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,460
front of that so so I'm pretty proud of

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,020
that work and it's topical right now in

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,940
fact most of my thinking at the moment

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:04,370
is going into snappy and I think you

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,450
know the cloud story really evolved 56

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,950
years ago we started to think about

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,630
computing its scale and how the

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,919
operating system needed to change and

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,440
the tooling that was needed to support

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,510
that and do jewel XD those things really

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,330
we conceptualize those five years ago

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:20,480
and they now bearing fruit snappy today

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,210
is in that early early stage and so for

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,340
me personally it's it's the blank canvas

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,260
right it's the really interesting stuff

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,730
where nobody's ever done anything like

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,919
this before and we have to figure out

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,750
kind of first from first principles

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,419
what's going to work what's going to be

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,540
important I think the key problems in

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:40,250
that distributed computing story our

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,690
security right security from lots of

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,090
angles you have got to be able to update

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,360
your home router for a G little sea

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,590
floor or a openssl floor and that's got

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,700
to happen automatically without you

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,080
thinking about it it's got to happen

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,120
without you having to go find the

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,100
firmware and download it and flash it

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,419
and cross your fingers and even a

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,850
sacrifice a goat under the full moon

00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:03,380
right it's got to be just work just be

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,970
reliable also for that really to reach

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,710
its full potential we have to add apps

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,030
and those apps are going to be untrusted

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,530
right we have to have apps from all over

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,600
the world to your home router

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,760
so how do we put those in a box how do

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,580
we how do we make those really secure

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,530
and then the cost of managing those

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,660
devices has to really go down imagine

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,770
your University you've got 3,000 access

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,140
points and they're going to run a bun

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,240
too that's great but if you need for

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,940
system administrators to run 3,000

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,920
servers right that's a lot of money just

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,570
to keep your Wi-Fi access networking

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,120
that's not going to work so thinking

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,280
about the costs of managing millions of

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,070
drones millions of robots millions of

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,650
things door knobs fireplaces hvac

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,540
systems access control systems keeping

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,610
that cost really clean and lean and

00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,930
manageable for every home or for every

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,330
business that's a really interesting

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:55,100
problem and so all of those things come

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:57,070
together for me inside snappy all right

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,170
kind of related to the previous question

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,360
Casares saying I'm very excited for Bo

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,150
to phone tablet and the new unity a

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,220
desktop what's the priority of the new

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,710
unity eight compared to server and

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,750
hypervisor I'm a fan of snappy but would

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,960
like to see the new 1610 with unity

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,940
eight right and well you will be able to

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,260
get 16 to 10 with unity a just like you

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:24,500
can get 1604 with with a mate or KDE

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,360
organ oh right it'll be there it'll be

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,770
an option and the team that's working on

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,510
that is committed to making that a

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,790
first-class option you ask you know

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,490
what's the priority for about 80 people

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,470
that is their top priority right that is

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,730
what they're focused on that's all the

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,040
pieces they're working on juggling all

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:43,670
the pieces to get that into into a fit

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,650
state and for the people working on

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,090
cloud it's not a priority at all and we

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,580
kind of have to be that way we have to

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,870
separate our areas of interest so that

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,180
we can have teams you just worry about

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,770
doing one thing really really well for

00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,170
the unity age and the desktop team

00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,180
that's their top priority right we know

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,350
that we have a big community that will

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,940
lead KDE that will lead gnome I'm you

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,980
know I'm super confident in there with

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,630
we're focused on unity eight and the

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,690
unity eight communities focused on unity

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,910
eight and that's their top priority and

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,120
I want to be running unity eight as my

00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:19,220
desktop for 16 10 I'm pretty sure that's

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,750
going to be a brittle and ropey

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,700
experience right just it's going to be a

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,299
1 point 0 brand new desktop environment

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,450
brand-new

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,269
story I'm also pretty sure it'll clean

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,159
up really quickly what the exact time

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:33,200
lines on that are difficult to tell I

00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,019
have said publicly I'd like the

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,970
community to tell us that 60 that unity

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:39,710
8 is ready to be the default of limited

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,779
experience I think I made a mistake

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,570
because I was so convinced in the

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,450
convergent story moving unity 7 into

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:51,259
position before it was before it was

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,429
ready in 1104 so lessons learned and I

00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,860
think the right way to deal with that is

00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,749
to make a great unity a desktop use it

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,570
ourselves and then let people vote

00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:01,580
essentially and signal that this is what

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:05,600
we want as the default unit Eve horrible

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:08,029
too all right changing gears a little

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,090
bit we've got three questions about your

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:13,279
previous adventures as a cosmonaut uh-uh

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,409
would you visit space again in the

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,139
future what was your favorite memory of

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:22,820
mirror and was going to space more

00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:25,190
exciting or more scary it's interesting

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,859
you know my favorite memories all have

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,580
to do with people and funny things

00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:32,869
people said stupid things that happened

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,940
mistakes you know that we can laugh

00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:37,159
about now but which maybe we wouldn't

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:42,739
have lost about and you're probably not

00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:44,090
so funny when they happen uh you know I

00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:46,129
remember very clearly there was an

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,679
experiment where they had some some i

00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:50,389
think was wheat grass growing and like

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,609
all i wanted to do for 10 days was gonna

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:59,299
make a crop circle and what I didn't and

00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:00,950
the there was one moment where I kind of

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,299
woke up in the middle of the night night

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,710
is an odd concept right you have your

00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:05,600
six hours where you're supposed to be

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,919
asleep outside it's like day night day

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,289
night day night as you go around the

00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,809
earth anyway I woke up in the dark at

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,830
night and looked out a window and as I

00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,330
looked out of the window there were

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,980
these eyeballs on the other side of the

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,690
window and it took me about half a

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,789
second to realize that it was sort of

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,129
internal reflection from one of one of

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,210
the many panes of glass but I literally

00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,999
I looked out the window and there was

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,429
someone looking back now shat myself

00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:30,859
briefly so I have those sorts of funny

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:33,230
memories of that I remember the time in

00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:35,330
Russia very you know very fondly it was

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,830
a great adventure lots of really

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,070
interesting as a cosmic community the

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,509
spell

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,809
community in Star City is very

00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:45,289
close-knit lovely people and a great and

00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:47,120
a great great time would I like to go

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,620
back hell yes but I'd like to a little

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,269
further than low Earth orbit and they're

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,519
fine people working on making that

00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:57,740
possible so when we stay focused on free

00:28:52,519 --> 00:29:01,220
software all right back to that then

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,710
Chloe is asking when will you use unity

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,149
8 on your desktop also do you use ubuntu

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,759
on the phone daily or do you still use

00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:10,159
alternatives like iOS and Android for

00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,769
apps i still use i still use

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,720
alternatives i'm using a bunch of on a

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:17,539
tablet more now the unity eight on a

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,070
tablet and i really want to get it on my

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:22,039
desktop it I was told it wasn't going to

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:25,279
be ready for 1604 and for good reason I

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:27,019
didn't really want to press press the

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,750
team given that 1604 is going to be used

00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:31,279
by so many people in so many desktop

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,529
environments I thought it was right that

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,700
we gave the team flexibility use their

00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:37,370
judgments to how much effort they put

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,169
into unity egg vs the infrastructure

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,809
that everybody depends on right gonna um

00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:44,539
KDE and so on so I thought that was the

00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:46,639
right call now i'm all about unity aight

00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:52,429
i want unity 8 on my laptop I expect

00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:53,840
I'll get it during 1610 and and you know

00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:57,200
I think a bunch of people will be using

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,000
it for 16 10 how fast it cleans up and

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,809
spreads beyond there is kind of up to us

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,639
right up to the community how much we

00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:06,440
swarm around that problem and make it

00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,970
work for each of us individually is a

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,379
function of how quickly it will become

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,379
useful for for the community at large

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,480
all right mushroom ensues asking you're

00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:20,299
just like in the middle of that what

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:25,340
what's your view on on unity 8 as a

00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:26,779
desktop Iser um it's recently gotten to

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,470
where i can actually start playing

00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:32,539
around with it um getting hangouts

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,940
working in the browser is probably one

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,220
of the biggest steps for me to be able

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,990
to start using it more full-time so i've

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,840
been using the Ubuntu web browser as my

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,700
primary for several months now and it's

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,399
working out really well so there's only

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,200
a few apps really that I need that

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,470
aren't going to run natively on unity 8

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,630
just yet

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,059
so I'm looking forward to it maybe after

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,330
the online summit is over I'll have some

00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:59,070
more time to play with it right well

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,350
there's a good awesome and it is it is

00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:04,350
available as a session you can install

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,150
on 1604 already so you don't if anyone's

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,900
interested in trying it out you don't

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:13,850
have to wait until 1610 to do that so I

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,669
did just get my my new XPS 15 which is

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,919
absolutely amazing loving it and so

00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,929
that's what I intend to get unity eight

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,400
up and running on not because it needs

00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:26,210
those kinds of give you resources that

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,780
so that i can run flats on a laptop but

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,880
but as part of the install for that i

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,130
went digging around looking for unity 8

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,120
on 1604 and was told not quite ready yet

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:42,299
but i will move to it as soon as I can

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,500
yeah so I'm still on a lenovo x 220 so I

00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,230
don't have a touch screen I'm looking

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:51,030
forward to seeing just how well unity

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:53,520
eight works without touch input alright

00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,260
the next question is from mushrooms he's

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,360
asking will we see a bun to branded

00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:05,669
hardware on a bun to store like home

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:08,220
routers my shirts etc um I think the

00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,860
great thing about Ubuntu is that enables

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,730
people to go pursue their interests and

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:17,970
it and and we're more effective as that

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:21,659
enabler than trying to crowd them out I

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:24,140
love that we have people who use ubuntu

00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:30,600
to deliver great devices from laptops

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:33,870
system76 through with with ubuntu core i

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:38,010
imagine a huge range of devices smart

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,240
screens robots drones you know all kinds

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,169
of things that are going to become

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,240
important to us i don't think i don't

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,429
think it helps to split Canonical's

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,230
attention down to the level of

00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:53,909
individual devices right you know if i

00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,530
look at top-of-rack switches there are a

00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,880
whole bunch of top of racks which is

00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,280
from a bunch of different vendors that

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,470
are now starting to usable into core

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,149
snap people and to effectively as their

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,249
base operating system and it allow

00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:07,229
then to compete on the hardware it

00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:09,509
allows software developers to

00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:11,700
essentially deliver applications that

00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:13,859
can run on any of those switches that's

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,960
a pretty incredible thing and I think

00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:22,589
we're best focused on you know staying

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,179
in that enable minh role i will add

00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:26,039
though if you want shirts we do have

00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,789
those already you can get those from our

00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:32,969
online store that in fact i'm wearing

00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:35,190
one right now that's the sub sub sub

00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:37,589
asks what's your favorite open source

00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:41,999
the vent not including anything a bunt

00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:43,830
too specific so I went to scale and for

00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:49,349
the first time and that was a it was a

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:53,849
pretty lovely event a nice mix of pure

00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:55,950
ops pure dev pure you know corporate all

00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:57,779
in balance it felt like that the

00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,929
companies were there but they they were

00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:03,179
wearing t-shirts not collared shirts

00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,950
effectively and I thought that was very

00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,200
cool where Facebook was there for

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,470
example with their open switches which

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,609
other was pretty pretty interesting

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,309
Rackspace was there talking about their

00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:18,569
work with containers and power which is

00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:20,760
which is pretty interesting I'm told

00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:22,500
that all things open is a phenomenal

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,220
event but I've never had that the the

00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,799
opportunity to go completely much more

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,839
beyond that I enjoy kind of some smaller

00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:36,599
events to the meetups I think I'm quite

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:38,549
fun all right McPhail says that deep

00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,819
mind has been given access to millions

00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:43,289
of patient records in the NHS is free

00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:45,359
and open source software lagging behind

00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:49,020
the curve in healthcare do you have

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,779
ambitions to change that situation super

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,579
interesting and so stepping back a

00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:56,539
little bit I think machine learning and

00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:59,369
deep learning which is essentially

00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:01,589
trying to extract information from David

00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:05,700
where a the brain extracts information

00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:10,319
from experience is a very powerful new

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:13,319
idea I like that increasingly that's

00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:15,029
moving out of the companies behind it

00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,050
like Google and Microsoft and Facebook

00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:19,450
and into the open

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,190
and so you know people are actually open

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,350
sourcing important work that they've

00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,680
done and I think we can be grateful you

00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,620
know Google led the way there I see

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,670
Facebook and Microsoft and others doing

00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:37,120
the same effectively the machine

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,670
learning deep learning AI story is kind

00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,780
of a profound moment in our history

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:46,450
because we are genuinely going to create

00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,010
intelligence that exceeds our own it is

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,810
going to happen it's going to happen far

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,820
faster than you might realize and I

00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:56,260
think the fact that it's happening in

00:35:51,820 --> 00:36:00,460
the open is for the best it's still a

00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,110
scary and profound moment but I think

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,620
it's good that it's happening

00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:07,180
increasingly in the open I think we need

00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,470
to weaken this assembly as a community

00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:14,260
could do we could essentially take those

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,090
tools which are kind of difficult and

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,610
baroque to use and we could bring that a

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,550
bun to magic to them how do i enable a

00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:25,510
researcher in any university to spin up

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:27,340
a deep learning infrastructure with any

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,290
of these open tools from any of these

00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,870
vendors that would be a cool thing to

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,030
work on the right attack line for that I

00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:36,160
think is juju charms there are already

00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,350
charms of much of the big data

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,670
infrastructure a Hadoop spark as well as

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,930
some of the sort of computer-oriented

00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,570
stuff that would fit there like

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:48,160
mesosphere and so that would be a fun

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,780
thing if you're interested in this to

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,390
participate in you're really focused in

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:55,570
on enabling anybody to participate in

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,980
the machine learning revolution and I

00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:05,720
think that would be valuable and

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:08,060
important work Michael you may be muted

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,369
a couple people want to know where you

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,410
get all the ideas for animal names for

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,540
all the abunch of releases and then

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,460
Chloe also wants to know if all of them

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:23,330
were to fight each other which one would

00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:25,280
win um the the honest truth is Google

00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,630
and a dictionary a huge say he used to

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,240
spend a weekend literally reading a

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,599
dictionary now there are search tools to

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,240
let me Zone in on a on a subset and

00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:40,220
there's a fairly sort of feverish market

00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:42,140
for for suggestions on on various wiki

00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:45,340
pages on the Ubuntu wiki that always

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,880
consult yakety-yak was a direct

00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,880
suggestion from

00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,140
you

00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:12,760
z but I'll keep that as a surprise for

00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:15,700
40 years time run again Michael I think

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,460
here sorry yeah we lost you for part of

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,250
that answer i think or least I did that

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:28,810
that might have been been the igoogle a

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:32,140
lot and user dictionary okay I see amar

00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,600
is asking um what will the naming scheme

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:39,870
be after 16 10 though I think he

00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:43,210
actually means after you know right and

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:46,210
let's leave that as a surprise for 17 10

00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:50,860
shall we we've never actually had an a

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:54,940
release though have we we have not all

00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,100
right uh sub sub sub wants to know what

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,420
happened to a bun to TV and a bunch of

00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,190
fun wants to know if it's still

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:05,980
something that we plan to do so what

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,990
happened was that we did enough work to

00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,380
be comfortable that the baseline of the

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:13,960
experience was there but we couldn't

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,270
find a TV manufacturer who wanted to put

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,930
a powerful enough chip into the TV at

00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,540
the time the Smart TVs that were being

00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:25,630
made were really they were putting the

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,490
weakest possible chip into the TV and so

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,440
we had to take a tactical decision and

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:33,190
we realized that there just aren't that

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,790
many TVs made in the world you know it

00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,860
would be of the various personal

00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:41,440
computing form factors would be the one

00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,330
that would get the the the lowest path

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,440
to a sort of volume widespread adoption

00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:49,270
so we paused it I remain convinced that

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,670
the full conversion story is necessary

00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,800
like we want to have full convergence

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,170
across in everything including the TV

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,730
experience so I'd love to have you know

00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,950
if you're interested in that I'd love to

00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,450
see unity eight having a community

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,730
that's driving it towards a great

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,590
experience with a with her with a

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:09,190
pointer effectively with remote control

00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,990
and I do think that the most important

00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,630
of the full conversion spectrum the you

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,030
know the phone tablet

00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,550
see threesome is the one that we should

00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,350
be focused on and so I'm really glad

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,060
that's where we are working but I to my

00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,760
mind that the big screen effectively

00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,530
remains interesting there will be others

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,240
as well but I don't really want to go

00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,750
into that until we've until we've got

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,280
the big three all right well speaking of

00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,490
that Mario group wants to know if we're

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,980
going to get in a bun to watch no I

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:40,410
don't think so i think that the watches

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:47,300
is fundamentally a companion device it's

00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:51,600
likely to be best done as a dedicated

00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:53,190
device experience effectively which i

00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:59,850
think is consistent with what we've seen

00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:01,500
elsewhere so my my gut feel is not now

00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,170
and we said that you may well see

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,210
watches that run a bun too but they

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,570
would be using a bun to call and then

00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:12,210
it'd be using mirror as a graphics layer

00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:14,820
effectively within a dedicated UI for

00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,320
that device bunch of core is small

00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,780
enough to run on a watch and in fact

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,180
they're there have there have been

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,710
watches from fairly big brands that

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,510
you've seen up on stage that we're

00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:28,380
actually running ubuntu core under the

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,790
hood and when one of those goes to

00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,980
production would be difficult for me to

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,420
say but it wouldn't be unity eight it

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,790
wouldn't be part of that convert that

00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,460
convergence experience I think you know

00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:42,810
that's too specialized a piece to fit

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,970
into that big picture all right just

00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,590
Caracas has kind of an open-ended

00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:54,000
question he says can you tell us

00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:55,290
something we don't know already I almost

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,920
certainly i'm just not sure why you'd be

00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,920
that interested

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,970
hoping for some secret nugget probably

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,980
know you know and one of the

00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,269
difficulties of working in the open is

00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,000
that there aren't that many secret

00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:12,410
nuggets right and usually we keep a

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,369
secret because it's somebody else the

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:17,890
secret that we're private privy to I

00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,329
think they have been some pretty

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,500
stunning twists and turns in the big

00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:24,799
picture of their journey of free

00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:27,259
software ubuntu on windows the native

00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:29,900
ubuntu environment on windows i think

00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:31,730
it's a pretty fantastic step i think

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,980
it's pretty fantastic for our community

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:40,519
that you know you can now share skills

00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:43,160
ideas tools trips tricks traps to a

00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:47,809
whole new audience and which i think is

00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:50,750
very very interesting i think it's

00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:52,940
testament to lena sand the colonel team

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,240
that they present such a crisp interface

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,579
that has been possible to essentially

00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,509
substitute that with the windows driver

00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,400
and I think it's testament to the

00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:03,529
Microsoft engineering that there that

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,599
they that they both saw that as valuable

00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:08,420
and important and have been able to do a

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,250
pretty amazing job of it so being part

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,799
of that was very exciting and was

00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:15,980
briefly a secret that we that we needed

00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:20,809
to keep but but there isn't very much in

00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:23,569
that regard all right Yan is asking what

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:29,480
is your weave one moment for the bunt to

00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:31,400
project wave one meaning now we've won

00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:37,329
so something happening like oh we

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,329
finally made it we won oh we've won um

00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:47,960
what a very very very long time ago

00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,569
smart people started saying thank you

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,279
for how I bun to is making a difference

00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:58,940
for them and I mean people like teachers

00:43:54,279 --> 00:44:02,299
people like entrepreneurs people running

00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,680
pretty big businesses and you know I

00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:05,930
don't know that that's a weave one

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,150
moment but it's definitely it I'm glad

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,770
we're doing it

00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:13,120
moment right and you know there are lots

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,360
of reasons I think for us to be proud of

00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:19,870
what we do and the way we do it and I

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,940
think the danger of weave one moment is

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,410
that it doesn't really reflect what's

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,360
actually going on what's actually going

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,000
on is that the whole world is moving to

00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,540
increasingly open ways of working at

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,850
everything and we happen to be playing a

00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,820
good role I think as the as the

00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:40,390
deliverer of a lot of that goodness when

00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,290
we say we've won it sort of it's a

00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,970
little bit like counting out

00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,410
concentrating our attention too much on

00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,270
who might have lost and that's not

00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,500
interesting and it also perhaps is

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,290
taking a little too much credit for

00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,840
everything that's happening right and we

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:54,160
shouldn't be shy about what we do we

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,950
take care of an incredible amount of

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,390
stuff that is important and it may be

00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:01,060
named kit sort of friction for other

00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,120
people and we also lead on a bunch of

00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:08,230
key things but in total we're part of a

00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:12,520
much bigger movement and you know we

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:15,880
have history on our side I think okay

00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,770
the next one is from Boog arias asking

00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,210
is it possible that a bun to in the

00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:25,300
future doesn't need debian anymore no I

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,920
see not sure that many people in table

00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,960
everybody in debian would share this

00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:34,230
view but I see a bun too and they Venus

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,990
two halves of the same coin and I

00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,910
technically I think I still am a DD and

00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:42,130
I certainly still think a lot about

00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,860
debian and as a project I think it's a

00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:48,220
very important project I think it does

00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,630
you know some things in a uniquely good

00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,850
way that we don't need to compete with

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,220
or stress about right what I think about

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:57,130
is that because of the way give Ian does

00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:59,230
certain things that because of things

00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:01,900
that make debian really great it will

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:05,260
also naturally fall short in other areas

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,580
now that's not a criticism of Debian

00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,260
it's simply saying that you make choices

00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,360
you know you said look we can be really

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,180
great at this or we can be really great

00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,770
at that and so what I try to do is I

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,340
think about what we can do in a bunch o

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:20,690
thats really complimentary to debian so

00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:24,079
if you think about that i see us as

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:26,060
the other half of of the tree you don't

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,530
think that the roots and the branches be

00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:31,849
silly for the branches to say they don't

00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:34,130
need reach right and so just that that's

00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:37,040
very clear to me I think it's clearer to

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:40,640
me than it is to my counterparts in

00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,250
debian but that's okay and you know

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,329
snappy is a really useful new primitive

00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:48,859
but our collaboration primitive inside

00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:50,270
canonical between canonical in the

00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:52,700
community and in most of the community

00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,530
our collaboration primitive is still

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,869
largely Deb's and will be for a long

00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:59,900
time Deb's form a great way to make the

00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:01,609
core of the system I think snaps parts

00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,230
which are the source code definition

00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:05,599
pieces that go into snaps are

00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,760
interesting new primitives as well but

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,650
we're not looking to substitute debian

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,380
away there's no need to it's a

00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,660
phenomenal project I think we contribute

00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:17,450
a lot to Debian success and vice versa

00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,819
and I don't feel any tension in that at

00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:24,950
all ok area is asking will we see a

00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:27,470
partnership with Microsoft on getting

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,510
the new microsoft office and skype on a

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:35,240
bun to like it's available on Mac um I

00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:37,460
really have enjoyed the collaboration

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,890
that we have with Microsoft in the areas

00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,680
where we have it and I think they're as

00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:45,410
your team is absolutely authentic Lee

00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,869
focused on delivering a cloud that can

00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,700
run any workload including any Linux and

00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:52,250
they see a bun to quite naturally as as

00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,250
a very important workload because it

00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:57,890
enables so much of the public loud and

00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,450
it's a genuine arms you know friendly

00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:02,839
arm's length collaboration and they're

00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,910
great guys I see that spreading to other

00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:08,329
parts of the company but I'm also quite

00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,859
realistic you know something like office

00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:12,140
is in a very different part of the

00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:15,290
organization that we don't have any real

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,700
reason to to engage with people they

00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:19,220
don't have any real reason to engage

00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,720
with with us at the moment and so I

00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:27,280
wouldn't expect an artificial construct

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:31,730
around that and I think the fact that

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:37,580
Google Docs is so central to

00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:39,920
our workflows for example has really

00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:44,060
changed the game I think the web is the

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,410
new application delivery mechanism for a

00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,320
lot of us I think the chrome guys are

00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,970
exactly right in that and so on that

00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,920
basis I think the most important thing

00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,040
for us to focus on is being a great

00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:01,820
secure platform for personal computing

00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:03,800
with a great web capability if there is

00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,530
a reason for us to work with Microsoft

00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:10,880
around office we'd be glad to do it you

00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:12,710
know we have to be principled but not

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,520
ideological there's a difference between

00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,990
those lions and and I think that would

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,600
be very good for our users if it came up

00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,700
but it's not going to happen just

00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,410
because we wanted to happen and there

00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:28,130
have to be some sort of trigger or

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,500
driver or rational now if we can

00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,410
establish a really great converged

00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,270
personal computing story and get some

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,190
real market traction for that then I bet

00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,600
they would do it in a heartbeat and I

00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:43,760
think we do a great job of it and we

00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:45,609
would enjoy the collaboration all right

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,710
and I think we've got time for one more

00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:50,570
just from Mario grip and he's asking if

00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:57,440
we have any plans on removing the

00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:59,300
Android part of ubuntu touch um yes I

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,190
mean it's a it's it's a slight

00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:08,500
awkwardness for us that that there is

00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:11,980
that it's not a clean stack effectively

00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:15,710
using part of the Android kernel and

00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,540
Driver stack effect of V is necessary

00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,910
it's an efficient way for us to get up

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,220
and running and I think it's really

00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,390
important for us to show that we can

00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,710
deliver a better end-user experience

00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:30,500
better security and a better experience

00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:32,900
for the device manufacturer if that's a

00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,260
clean stack if it's essentially all open

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:38,270
source and if it's all snaps effectively

00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,980
without that slight awkwardness the

00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,960
awkwardness isn't because it's Android

00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,210
this is not a tribe tribal thing it's

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,590
just because we have to integrate with

00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:48,230
something that itself

00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,970
in movable right that's that's a little

00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:53,590
tricky or worse which could move without

00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:56,990
us being aware that it might move and so

00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:58,460
so yes hopefully that happens and it's

00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,380
certainly not a piece that we love I'm

00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,730
kind of grateful to Android that their

00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,800
pieces there at all right if you think

00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,710
about it that gets us 99 percent of the

00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,880
way to where we need to be and and I

00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,100
think the Android guys have done a great

00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,020
job of building that ecosystem we

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,590
couldn't do half the things we do today

00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,060
if it weren't for them all right well

00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,040
thank you Mark for taking time out of

00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,380
your sprint this week to come do this

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,200
Q&A with us I want to thank everybody

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,900
yeah thanks everyone on IRC for your

00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,540
questions and also thanks to popy who

00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,700
helped me field all of these if you

00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,980
didn't get your questions answered you

00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,540
can ask them any time on IRC we've got a

00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,480
bunch of channels we also have a

00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:40,970
specific convergence QA coming up in

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,560
about five minutes so if you have more

00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,170
questions come there and you can ask

00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,130
them all right thank you Mark screw

00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,130
