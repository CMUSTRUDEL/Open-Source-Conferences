and down the bottom there's a little

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,110
chat box and then there you'll connect

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,880
to an IRC channel if you've got a proper

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,290
IRC client you can join it that way as

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,500
well it's a hash Ubuntu dash on dash air

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,820
on freenode network so just join the IRC

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,090
channel and you can chat to us while we

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,620
do this and ask us questions we

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,149
generally get to the questions after

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,850
we've had a bit of a chat about what's

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,980
been going on the last couple of weeks

00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,780
and then we'll just answer your

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,660
questions if they're kind of off-topic

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,149
or you know things we can't really

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,369
answer then we might tell you where to

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:10,380
go in terms of where to get a better

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,780
answer or we might try and get someone

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,979
on a later one of these q and A's who

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,460
could probably answer the question

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,619
better sometimes we'll go off on IRC and

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,210
ping random people and find the answer

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,979
for you and come back to a bit later on

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,210
so if you stick around you might

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,360
actually find if your question isn't

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,390
answered fully or the answers later all

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,759

on on Twitter on google+ and elsewhere

00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:01,709

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,440
said while you get clear you want I'll

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,989
give you long enough or I'm too slow

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,540
okay take your time take your time and I

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,609
can maybe already start talking about a

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,680
few things which are happening in snappy

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:31,200
dad because that's what i'm currently

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,590
looking at a lot and we're very close to

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,609
having the next step craft release under

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,390
the door and it's just tested it earlier

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,579
and all the small bugs all the hard to

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,459
read error messages all that stuff is

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,769
gone it's just beautiful now and it also

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,840
comes with a bunch of new plugins which

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:56,310
is going to for example there's going to

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,290
be a node.js plugin and another plug-in

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,950
which there's nothing which is very very

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,630
useful lots of other stuff so they're

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,120
very close to to announcing it and

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:12,510
there's going to be a snappy clinic soon

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,910
and epic clinics are also one of the use

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,829
of good John air so all those Neffe

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:22,109
clinic sessions also go to that account

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:26,070
and it's basically where we introduce

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:29,550
people to nappy and snap craft where we

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,990
just talk about what new do demos invite

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,840
people to talk about their use of

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,910
slepian snap craft and where you can

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,030
basically bring all the questions and

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:44,550
and problems you have it's that kind of

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:47,190
a kind of event so probably ya later

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,960
this week or maybe next week we're going

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:54,180
to that you not be on that step e

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,430
mailing list and there's also lots and

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:02,850
lots of work going on in in steffi

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:05,130
itself so a buncha now the 1504 was the

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,780
stable release for step you because it

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,870
was the first one and where we guarantee

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,960
that it's going to be stable and it this

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,690
table and also back potting you see just

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,030
you to that milestone but right now

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,040
everyone is looking at at making 1604

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,760
the LTS because it's going to be

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,500
supported for 5 35 years anyway and we

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,340
put a lot of effort into it you're

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,310
making it it it just really great and

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,690
and there might be some there's going to

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,870
be some changes which are going to get

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,600
back what's incompatible but my gut

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,700
feeling is that 1604 is what everyone is

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,860
going to face their work on so it's

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,190
already worth looking at it and see

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,480
what's what's happening there but

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,970
there's different already ever already

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,510
images being created for a 1604 steady

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,360
yes there's any elimination like you

00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,780
never advisable in cali em off yeah

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,760
that's good thing yeah ah yeah yeah if

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,670
you go to develop ubuntu context

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:10,140
snappy's they start you get long list of

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:15,450
all the way so you can use snappy yeah

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:18,840
and instead meters are there cool um in

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,480
the last couple of weeks I've some small

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,680
update from myself we recently pushed

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,680
out OTA eight to the phones so if you're

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,870
running ubuntu stable channel on one of

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:37,470
the retail devices the bqe 4.5 or e 5 or

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,440
the meizu mx4 or if you're running on

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,500
their nexus

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,390
or or the Nexus 7 then you should have

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,820
got an update in the last week or so

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,570
well actually within a 24-hour period

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,220
sometime last week or if your phone

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,870
happens to be sat in a drawer for six

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,390
months and you took it out and turn it

00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:02,440
on you'll get an update so part of the

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:05,650
update was an change to some of the the

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,700
toolkit so if you sat to phone side by

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,410
side you might not notice it immediately

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,740
but if you SAT two phones side-by-side

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,240
on one's on OTA 7 and 10 ta 8 you'll

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,650
probably notice the difference some of

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,660
the the user interface looks a little

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,310
bit different and that's used across a

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,320
lot of the apps and one of the things

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,440
we'd be doing in core apps is updating a

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,920
lot of the apps so they use the new the

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,110
new tool kit one of those was the music

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,580
app which I uploaded to the store a

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,860
couple of hours ago so if you're running

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,400
a buncha phone you should have an update

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,610
today for the music app fixes a bunch

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,600
bugs and updates the user interface we

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,700
got a whole bunch of other stuff lined

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,190
up but that was a relatively minor

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,919
update a bunch of other apps are being

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:55,090
updated and we'll come to the store soon

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,700
so clock calculator weather calendar and

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,310
so on we'll update all of those as well

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,220
and also we're tantalizingly close to

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,120
putting an update to the doc viewer in

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,850
the store which has libre office support

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,980
built in contesting that yeah it's

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,780
really really cool I can't wait to put

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,940
that in the store we're trying to be

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,260
like very methodical and very careful

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,080
about putting in because we don't want

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,860
to put a you know substandard experience

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,320
on the phone for users but it works

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,919
surprisingly well on a you know

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,710
mid-range phone like the bqe 4.5 opening

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,839
you know small to medium sized documents

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,700
which is what you kind of expect on a

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,719
phone nobody's going to be you know

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,810
opening thousand-page Excel spreadsheet

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,140
documents you know openoffice stull

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:50,650
files you could try but almost certainly

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,150
run out of memory so yeah trying to set

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,410
the expectations there

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,760
but an updated that should come within

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:01,540
the next week or so what else google

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,390
code in kicks off on december the

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,820
seventh and we're involved in google

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,300
coding if you get a code in dot with

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,340
google com or just search for google co

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,710
lien on your favorite search engine and

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,120
you'll find all the blurb about what

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,900
google coding is it's a great

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,290
opportunity for people of school age say

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,760
13 to 17 to get involved in open source

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,450
we're one of the mentoring organizations

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,050
we had a lot of tasks that that we've

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,610
written up for people to do things ways

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:39,010
in which they can get involved it's not

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,270
just coding so if you're good Penn Smith

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,110
then maybe you could do a bit of

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:46,750
documentation or if you're if you're

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,490
good at doing testing methodical testing

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,680
and there's some QA tasks in there as

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,370
well so we've got a real spread across a

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,390
number of categories and coding QA

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,470
documentation and a bunch of others as

00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,570
well but that launch is in a week or two

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,090
and we'll have a load of things for

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:08,140
people to do if you're a member of the

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,340
ubuntu community we welcome more mentors

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,900
it'd be great if we had a few more

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,370
mentors you've been people who've been

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:17,140
around in the ability community and can

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:20,260
help these are new contributors to get

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:24,220
started that we really really help just

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:27,880
ping myself or balloons on IRC or jose

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,550
on IRC wearing them hash of them to your

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,690
community team all the time and I think

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,930
you can probably find our email

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:38,710
addresses some help and I have a

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:41,560
question for those of us watching who

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,800
are involved in the wounded project

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,490
already and who might have some stuff up

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,440
this leave like how big are these tasks

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,720
supposed to be how does it generally

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,130
work do we just write this up somewhere

00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:01,420
so if you or for all of those questions

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:03,100
I the yeah so we think of a task as

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,780
being you know something that could be

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,120
done in a few hours maybe

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,430
so these are not google summer of code

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,530
style weeks and we two weeks of

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,720
development these are you know fairly

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,350
small atomic you can think of them

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,950
almost like bite-sized tasks or paper

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,190
cut type things which you know someone

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,600
with a bit of skills could probably do

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,580
you know if it's the very first task it

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,780
might take them half a day once they've

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,790
done a few of them they might get a bit

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,290
faster and they might do you know three

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,490
or four in a day or you might just get

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,720
through one or two in the day it really

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,060
depends how much time you got to

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,860
dedicate to it and if you are a member

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,320
of the community and you've got tasks

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,810
that you you think would be suitable

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,420
that fit that kind of criteria you know

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,540
put your your head as a you know a

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,660
thirteen-year-old you know new person to

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,010
open source you know what kind of task

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,810
would be appropriate what kind of time

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,400
scale be appropriate then yeah write it

00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,890
up there are some examples on the site

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,600
so you can see the kind of format and

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,850
the style and how much detail needs to

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,590
go in there and if you've got a bunch of

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,450
them write them up send them to myself

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,580
or balloons or Jose and will include

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,800
them in the list and then we'll track

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,400
them over the period of the Google

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,560
coding so yes we are keen for members of

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,880
the community from all areas of the

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,430
commute of the adventure community to

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,480
identify what you might consider paper

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:29,830
cuts or by size bugs that we can get new

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:33,280
people involved with cool yeah thanks

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,470
dad for organizing it I was mostly mixed

00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:42,220
gags to be honest so I'll pass your

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:44,490
thanks hon brilliant I what's next and I

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,620
once wanted to talk about Luke on summit

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:52,540
and it's going to be co-hosted with

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:56,410
scale scale 14-6 last Southern

00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:00,040
California Linux expo in pasadena

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:03,520
America somewhere yes California close

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,790
to LA and it's good to be beginning of

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,820
next year so i think around that what is

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,220
it the night 19 yeah i think its 21st to

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,560
the 24th is scale and we're probably

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,510
going to be there from about the 20th on

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,550
work so i think

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:24,390
no good yeah a big part of it are going

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,460
to be like guerdon unconference we're

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,770
going to have lots of discussions there

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,550
so if you're in the area or if you're at

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,980
scale anyway consider dropping by bring

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,500
up your questions ideas stuff you want

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:42,840
to discuss and meet all the you buddy

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,310
folks mmm yeah I look to be travel plan

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,080
and it seems like a whole load of us are

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,790
going out there so there's going to be a

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,070
lot of people spread around the company

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,130
since it's not just people from the

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:57,210
community team myself Daniel Mike and

00:13:53,130 --> 00:14:00,270
then David but also you know there are

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,540
people from the snappy side there are

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:06,510
people from the design team desktop team

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,000
and I do believe mark shuttleworth and

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:13,860
Jane Silber I'll see you going to be

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,560
there as well the correct but yeah we

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,510
thought to that okay we got some

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,760
questions to crack on his now we did

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:26,450
waffling for few minutes but the writing

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,070
and if the first one was from gragas

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,350
how'd you get a free ubuntu phone I'm a

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,070
developer with big plans that I need a

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:41,240
new bluetooth phone yeah so this is

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:43,920
tricky so there's a few things one is uh

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,020
for certain types of applications you

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,120
don't need a phone you know so for

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,970
applications may be written in qml or

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,860
even even in C++ you can actually

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,670
develop directly on the desktop using

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,730
our SDK and test them out on on the

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,290
desktop I appreciate sometimes you want

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,850
to test them on the phone maybe you know

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,530
things like the sensors you need to be

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:12,030
able to you know test that the phone

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:15,630
works or GPS or your other form factor

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:18,770
specific things and in which case yeah

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,970
it can be tricky sometimes you can find

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,010
someone else in the community who has a

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,900
phone you can test stuff for you so once

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,190
you get your app or your game or

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,020
whatever it is to a certain level of

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,650
functionality you could you know send

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,540
them a twix package and ask them to

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,820
testing in fact I spent some time

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,830
yesterday and today doing exactly that

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,780
for other people I'm not suggesting

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,050
everyone should send me click packages

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,660
and I'll test them for everyone um but

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,220
uh you know it is possible to find

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,430
someone else with the phone who you know

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,560
can help you out in that regard in terms

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,080
of getting one for free I I don't know

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,060
you know ask around some people buy

00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,230
phones and then don't actually end up

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:02,240
using them or you know decide that it

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,860
stopped for them or you know for

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,390
whatever reason decided only use anymore

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,300
and sometimes people will give those

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,550
away I got given a Firefox phone

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:15,290
somewhere here because for exactly that

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,630
reason so yeah ask around and then the

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:23,570
other thing is on the BQ website there's

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:25,850
a e 4.5 outlet where they sell I think

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,990
they're reconditioned devices so these

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,450
are devices that gone out to customers

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,460
and the customers sent back for whatever

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,920
reason you know maybe they just don't

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,770
like it or don't want it and then

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,070
cleaned up put in a new box and then

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:43,070
resold at a lower price and I think it's

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:46,370
a hundred and thirty euros that they go

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,590
for but if you I'll I'll get the link

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,710
because I was looking at it earlier on

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:56,060
today and then there's also I remember

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:59,150
somebody basically like a Kickstarter

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,240
thing they said I'm working on this

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,160
project and if you back me i can buy a

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,959
device them and make sure that it works

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,730
all right there so if you have a really

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:13,310
good idea why not try it mmhmm yeah

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,560
absolutely stay up I think there's a

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:21,350
there's a number of ways so you can

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:24,620
achieve this and as we in canonical we

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:26,300
we don't drive the sales of the phone we

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,090
don't produce them so we don't have a

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,970
free phone for developers program or

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:37,330
something like that we just don't we

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,330
just do the of just do the free software

00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:46,499
okay our next question a question from

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,350
the best with other legacy programs like

00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:51,989
[ __ ] libreoffice firefox be available

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,779
for arm-based converge devices i assume

00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:57,710
first only the open source programs will

00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,909
be recompiled for arm-based devices and

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,129
the good thing is the stuff you

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:04,169
mentioned like [ __ ] LibreOffice firefox

00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:07,919
that's all open source stuff in the

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:11,489
archive and as soon as we offered on

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,639
port basically all of these packages

00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:18,359
were already built for arm so everything

00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:23,399
that you can get from you go to archive

00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:27,690
it's going to be there anyway right the

00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:29,940
the so so there's two questions there

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,769
really there's the you know other arm

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,919
based builds for those pieces of

00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:36,809
software in the answer is yes there are

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,859
but then the second part I guess that

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:44,100
wasn't asked but you can kind of infer

00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:46,350
from that is will they run on the writer

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,799
converge based about converge devices

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:53,909
and um for the ones you've listed the

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:57,059
answer is yeah they will we're using for

00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:01,460
those applications that require X so

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:04,350
they don't run natively under near then

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,499
we have a compatibility layer if you

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:11,249
like called X mere an X mirror allows

00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:14,879
you to run x based applications on top

00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:18,659
of mere so I'm just booting up a tablet

00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:22,529
to show you exactly that um so go to

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:24,029
nexus 7 here and i don't know if you'll

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,100
be able to see this but you could

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,570
probably see there's some familiar icons

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,909
there for Firefox and [ __ ] and

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,119
LibreOffice and G edit conveniently the

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,850
ones you ask for it's almost like I set

00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,460
that up so we're you know we're working

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,039
on getting those apps like the headline

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,299
you know ones that everyone knows about

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,590
working on the converge devices takes a

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,520
little bit of work but once we've got

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,830
the framework

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:58,590
in place other actually able to follow

00:19:52,830 --> 00:20:04,440
after that so I think the answers a

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:08,100
question yep next question is from narat

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,810
or euro tea I don't know I when are we

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:15,030
going to see unity 8 um well if I was

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,690
being facetious I would say you can see

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,220
it by buying and a bunch of phone

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:24,330
because you like there it is that to

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,490
unity a um but again I wouldn't i would

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,890
guess there's another in third question

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,070
in there which is when are we going to

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,400
see it on the desktop and the answer

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,410
that we've had from well you know you

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,830
can there it is possible to install

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:45,240
unity a on the desktop it's not finished

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:47,250
yet so it's not as you know a good as

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,800
good an experience as unity 7 is right

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:56,310
now and I don't know when it will be the

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:59,430
default but it certainly will there will

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:03,180
be a shipping image that you can install

00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,650
for 1604 so there'll be an image it

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,860
won't necessarily be the default it

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,470
won't when you upgrade to 1604 yours

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,350
your unity 71 get replaced with unity

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:21,120
eight but there will be a way if you to

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:23,790
run your TA and 1604 right next question

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,610
is from the best any news on how the

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:32,610
scopes will work and look on the unity a

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:35,820
desktop choice what the design team has

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:39,840
been thinking of or what what they are

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:44,540
going to try to do with stuff on their

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:47,610
scopes yeah I I I don't know the answer

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,550
because the design team is still working

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,050
on that well I'm not sure they are still

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,030
working I think they may well have

00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,570
already worked that out but it just

00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:00,630
hasn't been implemented yet and so I

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,360
would say wait and see or maybe you

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,440
should ask a designer to give us a an

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,160
answer on that

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,520
you may have seen some prototypes or

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,160
mock ups or screenshots I don't know

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,660
shared recently i think i've seen some

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,760
floating around of what the alt tab

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,510
switcher looks like on the desktop and

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,410
and I think the Scopes will be

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,790
integrated with that somehow I don't

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,650
know exactly because I haven't seen the

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:33,420
design but I know it's being worked on

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,490
nice yeah and one great thing about

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,430
scopes is you might have seen the

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:42,320
announcement recently and you can write

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:45,360
them now in with JavaScript which is

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,220
beautiful so no more like if you know

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,380
about javascript in know where to get

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,470
your data from know how to get it

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,570
presented and so on and it's certainly

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,570
going to be much easier than nothing

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,260
around this superfast no more

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:05,040
recompilation you're more shipping up of

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,230
multiple architectures so should be good

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,250
yeah yeah look forward to that look for

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,050
to seeing what people come up with

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,540
because it seems like it could be really

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,330
good for rapid rapid prototyping a rapid

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,130
development of scopes in JavaScript [ __ ]

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,400
you know a lot of people who know

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:24,330
JavaScript on the planet and next

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,420
question is aimed at you Daniel T Simon

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:30,590
q2 says at if you'd like to help out

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:34,440
with snappy development where do you go

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,390
a bunch of places so all of this deputy

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,690
ms hanging out in the hest steffi

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:43,560
channel on freenode and you can find the

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:47,670
source for snappy itself and snap craft

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,850
on github and lots of people are already

00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,220
contributing to you too too snappy and

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,890
snap craft Stephie itself is written in

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,630
in gold so you if you know that go

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,870
that's good to make things easier for

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:03,450
you but there's also like the test suite

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:06,570
and stuff which are which are written in

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,310
Python and step craft is completely

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,010
written in Python and it's it's a

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:16,380
beautiful project everyone responds

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:18,120
quickly just very nice

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,010
yeah snap craft is an interesting

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,710
project for those people who don't know

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:28,680
give the tweet size description of what

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:33,290
snap craft is and basically what you did

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:35,550
with packaging basically the task of of

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,790
taking a piece of software and turning

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:41,250
it into package people can install and

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,990
that was complicated always tried to

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,740
tell people that it's easy but it was

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:48,990
complicated and still is for maybe even

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,990
good reason sometimes the subgraph makes

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:56,790
a super super easy and it's very easy to

00:24:51,990 --> 00:25:01,640
pull in source code to pull in binary ZF

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:06,120
in the you go to archive just from from

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:09,660
yep from lots of pubs on the net you can

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:13,820
grab the salt and and basically bundle

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:16,200
it all up so so it becomes second

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,600
something more integrated it's not like

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,190
it as a small package but but you you

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,570
make sure that the app everything it

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,410
needs that everything is in there

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:27,150
included and that it all works and

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,730
instead craft you just write one yamla

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,200
file that's it you basically just list

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,000
what needs to go where and it just works

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,730
awesome slightly longer than tweet size

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,990
but it was looking like 15 or 20 tweet

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:49,020
but ok and next question from Mario grip

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,850
he says is there any plans for preview

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,310
so it's just scroll the screen is always

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,320
really other any plans for preview

00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:58,920
version of snappy on a bun to touch

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,320
anytime soon so the meaning of this

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,920
question is that at the moment the so

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,750
the desktop is based around package

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
management is based around Debian

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,540
packages so you know if you want to

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,670
install skype on the desktop you're

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,850
going yet Scott Deb and you install it

00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:18,390
if you wanted to install and you know

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:22,350
some game on your ubuntu phone there

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:26,910
click packages and snappy packages are

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,440
the next evolution on from click and at

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,950
the moment all the phone images are

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,720
based around click

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,740
packages and not snapping packages I

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:39,159
think the target to move too snappy is

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:42,039
probably not going to be until 1604 so

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,000
sometime April that that kind of area

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,919
maybe even later than that I don't know

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,039
but I and I don't think there are any

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:55,600
preview images yet oh I don't a pretty

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,519
certain there are no privileges let me

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,340
be more bold there are no preview images

00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:03,750
snappy for a bungee touch right now and

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:07,179
I don't I don't think there will be

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,529
until like some way into next year just

00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:13,179
because it's a lot of work and I think

00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:16,470
we want to make sure that the snappy

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:19,210
base the 16 for snappy base is

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:23,110
completely rock-solid before we start

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,450
moving phones across to it yeah but yeah

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,380
if you if you have a very deep interest

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:31,559
in this question you can ask Allah cool

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,940
because he had somebody else on come

00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,100
remember who it was but they there's

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:41,760
been a long time looking at the problem

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:49,720
and they they have a good fan yep yep um

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:52,179
ah yes you got it Alex page that says

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:58,299
hello from coffle Greece is categories

00:27:52,179 --> 00:28:01,200
hello hello was it kalispera wasn't

00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:05,799
wasn't good good evening something else

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,659
well you're a movie can I do is that

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:11,370
gripped going to replace able to

00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:14,289
software center in 1604 LTS release

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:20,169
that's good question I think the short

00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:24,820
answer is no yes and that's for two

00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:27,399
reasons I think I think the selections

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,340
were made to use gnome software am I

00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:33,549
wrong is that right legs up yeah I think

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:37,350
we'll send a mail to the desktop team

00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:40,330
list or devel list recently saying that

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,100
1604 would ship without a bunch of

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,080
Software Center for numerous reasons

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,029
that we've got

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,059
lots and lots of times and many of which

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:50,490
you probably already know and at grid is

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,590
a really popular tool and you could

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,860
probably install that on 1604 and you'd

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,500
be fine but I don't think that we're

00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,580
going to consider putting that given

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,620
that we've already looked at all the

00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,440
options and gnomes oft where seems to be

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:08,159
the one that's been selected by the

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:11,789
desktop team wasn't Everett also closed

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,510
sauce well it's written in Python and

00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:18,539
it's in a PPA on launch pad so you

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:23,639
certainly can look at the source um but

00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:25,049
um I yet Amy I'm sure you know but the

00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:29,669
answer is that a decision has already

00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:33,809
been made anyway okay yep yep next

00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:37,350
question from T Simon q2 Simon is that

00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:40,230
silent T do we think Simon cute anyway

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:44,269
he says do you have a bunch of phone and

00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:50,909
if so where did you get one yeah I do ah

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:54,330
there it is and it's BQ e 4.5 and I

00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:57,510
bought it the day they came out I went

00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,549
to beacuse website and ordered one and

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,700
then when it arrived in the post i

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:05,100
skipped around the house like an idiot

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:10,789
delighted that you know a device was now

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,789
in my hands that we have helped create

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,769
yep same goes for mines writing online

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,299
it makes for basically Sigma's puppies I

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:25,049
have an amex for as well but i sat on it

00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:27,570
and broke it so I don't know but it

00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:30,870
makes floor anymore yeah may ultimately

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,730
as a nexus for around here some well

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,110
there is as an exit for in here

00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,480
somewhere as well that's that's actually

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,809
another another good point is you know

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,230
if you want a a good way to get started

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:47,820
on ubuntu you can pick up a second hand

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:50,419
at nexus 4 on like your favorite

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,340
shopping website ebay or whatever and

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,740
flash up onto onto that and actually the

00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:01,370
nexus 4 is a good choice to use

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,370
because you pair that with one of these

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,230
bluetooth keyboard sit your little phone

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,929
in there and you can plug it into a

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,640
display and test out all the funky

00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:14,190
convergent stuff that we keep talking

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,850
about all you need is a slim port

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,679
adapter hdmi cable plug it into a

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,559
display that's got an hdmi port of

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,920
course and where you go you can start

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,100
yeah also you might need a bluetooth

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:37,590
mouse as well now pair those and nexus 4

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:41,070
is a good choice bring it next question

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,750
is from Chloe Wolfie girl gnome store is

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,400
replacing the Ubuntu Software Center ah

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,040
as follows on from the previous question

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:55,550
in unity 7 how will it affect click

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:59,190
packages unity 8 and other things gnome

00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:02,190
store organ on apps is going to tie in

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,970
with unity 8 i'm quite sure about that i

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,059
don't think there's any plan to put

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:11,240
gnome software on the unity 8-based

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:16,380
images it's only on the unity 7

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:20,280
debian-based images however I think

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:23,480
we'll mention the possibility that they

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,950
might add the ability to Nome software

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,170
to enable it to install snappy packages

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,910
I think they're looking at that that's

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,740
so it could be possible that you could

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,200
install snappy packages I don't think

00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,470
they'll add click package support

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:46,710
because I think really we consider quick

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:48,030
as i'd like to say deprecated but it

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,410
isn't yet because there's phones out

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,990
there that have still got it installed

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,150
but you know we're we're working on the

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,290
next generation after click so i don't

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,679
think the desktop will have anything

00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:01,309
click related it will all be snappy in

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,710
the future so click as a shorter future

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:05,920
yes that's probably a more tactful way

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:09,230
of saying it thank you

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,590
so yeah as far as i understand it no

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:17,690
Maps has a plug-in mechanism which we

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:19,400
need to work on anyway so to teach it

00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,680
about the book to archive and how to

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:27,230
install depth as you give the same work

00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:29,600
is going to be done for slapping and the

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,470
conversation carried on in the open to I

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,980
asked 12 on IRC channel right now after

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:39,020
like Chloe wolfinger I'll ask the

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,910
question my calls there and they're

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,080
having a discussion it's good idea if

00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,460
you're watching this video on YouTube

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,200
join the IRC channel 12 on air and yeah

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:53,930
get more comprehensive answers from

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:57,710
other people when you do from us okay

00:33:53,930 --> 00:34:01,520
next question mm-hmm the next question

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:08,060
is from is it cool cat is that the next

00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:13,370
one um the best of how are you i miss

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:17,510
that yeah so things look away doing

00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:19,700
pretty much thank you um then we have ah

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,649
there we go there we go I found it now

00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,379
another question from Mercury will

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:31,429
figure what features and updates are you

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:37,629
excited for in OT a nine ooh ok I'll

00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:37,629
give you three well

00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,460
improvements to I know this is all hand

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,060
wavy but improvements to the convergence

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:52,280
stuff so right now the image that's on

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,180
the nexus for that lets you plug it into

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:59,470
a display and keyboard and a mouse is

00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:02,480
pretty preliminary and while it works um

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,310
you can break it by ear if you unplug

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,930
the phone and plug it back in again you

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,210
go a bit crazy with the phone you you

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,740
can make it crash right so there's a

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,270
bunch of stability stuff that's going to

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:17,090
happen that's going to make that better

00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:19,810
there's a bug in the camera app which

00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:22,700
I'm hoping gets fixed by a nine on the

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,560
mx4 it has a 20 megapixel camera but

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,230
there's a bug which means it takes

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,280
photos a slightly less lower resolution

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:33,590
than that and I've seen that Florian is

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,680
working on that and I've seen that he's

00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,960
been testing a fix for that this week so

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,760
I look forward to that so all the mx4

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,270
users can actually use the camera the

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:48,880
full resolution that is designed for and

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:54,590
the third one is i would say adding more

00:35:48,880 --> 00:36:01,070
apps by default to the device like maybe

00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:03,920
an email client by default maybe yes or

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:09,820
a one bit but being fixed today which

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:14,000
was about being able to to set your own

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:17,390
what's it like a custom ringtone I think

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,770
that's pretty great as well hmm yes I

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,470
like that see that's one of the problems

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:24,170
is like you when you're making a Minimum

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,240
Viable Product being able to you know

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,660
have a ringtone and have a phone that

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,040
rings like is like super important you

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,710
know being able to change the ringtone

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,140
is a nice to have that covered 9 I

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:40,280
actually you know it making phone calls

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,230
pretty sure the first person who

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,600
received a phone call honored a bunch of

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,580
phone was Jane Silber from like one of

00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,110
the conference rooms they phoned her

00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,120
honor on an abutting phone when they got

00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,800
the phone working phone her in her

00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,270
office was

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,290
hey we're fighting for what about to

00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:59,230
phone yeah that kind of stuff really

00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,700
important ringtone slightly less slow

00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,900
down the priority this but still you

00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,790
know nonetheless super important I am so

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,080
yeah good to see that kind of thing that

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,120
kind of thing and one of the problems of

00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,940
us you know when we all get together and

00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,220
we've all got our a bunch of phones if

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,870
one of them rings it like everyone picks

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,430
the phone because they've all same

00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,470
ringtone mean you never know whose phone

00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:25,270
it is so it like the old nokia you know

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,830
you know everyone had that ringtone back

00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:33,490
in the day it's very much like that an

00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:36,970
economical office anyway ah cool cat

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,480
asks current unity 8 theme looks weird

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:43,000
that's very tactful when we have a new

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,270
theme and how would it look like will it

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,250
be like ambience so I always get your

00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,950
own away ambience is the dark one isn't

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,740
it and radiance is the light theme I

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,000
think so yep yeah I never know which way

00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,200
around they are I just set it and forget

00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,770
it um sure I'm so I don't know yep

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:09,460
sitting in it raft asks is there any

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:14,320
chance we can expect a convertible OS in

00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:19,960
a bunch of phones yes you can expect

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:22,000
that yes yes expect that yeah go get us

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,730
related to the previous question how

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,600
hard is it to make my own thing you have

00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:31,480
to know C sharp so you can read out CC

00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,170
shop already because there's nothing

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,020
written in C sharp for the phone and

00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,900
alrighty on theme I don't know how far

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:44,980
along we are and I saw some blog posts

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,140
about the mobility of apps so if you

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,840
want your team to you have like it's

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:53,440
it's own special look it's very easy to

00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,930
do that just have a look at developer

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,060
boo to come but creating your own theme

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,730
for the entire device I'm not so sure

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,430
about also like if you have your own

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,570
written your own scope it's also easy to

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:09,820
customize the

00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:13,330
a look of that but yeah for a proverb

00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:17,080
full theme I don't know yeah I think I

00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:19,720
think it's like the ringtones thing you

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:23,560
know Minimum Viable Product get a phone

00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,420
that has a theme later add support for

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,120
multiple things and I think we're at the

00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:31,120
stage where we almost got a like decent

00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:34,690
theme but I don't I think some of that

00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,920
is really hard wired I think there's it

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,140
via the ability to have multiple

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,150
different themes in the shell and switch

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,940
everything you know from one thing to

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:53,140
another I think that's just yeah just

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:54,760
not done yet next question is from well

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,460
actually so following on from that I

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,750
would say go to hash of winter unity

00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,600
because that's where the unity of

00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:05,470
developers hang out people like SAVAK

00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,690
and Mike zanetti Michael said I see

00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,430
those are the kind of people hang them

00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,770
if you really want to get involved in

00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,450
this you know this work outstanding work

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,340
that we you know we could have done they

00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,320
would know they'd be the right person to

00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:22,810
go to so a bunch of unity and ask them

00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:24,790
about theming okay Ridge ring asks what

00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,380
are the ethical questions that need to

00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,920
be answered about a bunting members

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:32,620
asking for crowdfunding to go to the

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,110
februari Ubu corn in California well

00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,680
first one is if you're going februari

00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:41,920
you'll miss it because it's in January

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,790
so make sure you get the right date um I

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,290
don't know hey you know it's tricky in

00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,870
community stuff whatever money gets

00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,690
involved it starts getting difficult you

00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:54,460
know they're there are you know people

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,960
who don't like one person being given

00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,060
money and someone else not being given

00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,040
money and you know why are you spending

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,440
money on this thing I think you should

00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,180
spend money on this other thing whereas

00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,860
you know when money isn't involved and

00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,580
it's just about code it's like you know

00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:11,470
you get on a G you get online code so

00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,570
yeah there can be like awkward

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:16,950
conversations about money but I don't

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,700
think it's you know unethical for

00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,849
community members to

00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,920
I'd really like to go to this thing but

00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:25,900
I can't afford it or you know I'm a

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,670
student or you know for whatever reason

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,630
yeah the money isn't there to be able to

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:35,290
go to try and find ways and means to

00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,820
fund that and I don't think crowdfunding

00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,920
is and how registro doing I've seen

00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:43,630
other people crowd fund their way to

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:49,480
events in the past so yeah I don't have

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:52,750
a problem with it myself yep yep goofy

00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,579
girl again asks talking about themes any

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,430
updates on customizable things such as

00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:59,619
different keyboards cursors and icons I

00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,930
think that's all kind of related why

00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:04,240
although keyboard specific is a little

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:07,810
bit different and I think there's some

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,450
work on going for making custom

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,040
keyboards so for example you know the

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,589
terminal you might want to keyboard that

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,380
has lots of extra characters and an easy

00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:18,940
to find hash key and easy to find till

00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,660
there and you stuff like that that you

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,740
you know you need in a terminal I think

00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,599
there's work i'm going there Mike

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,329
Sheldon has been working on that but I

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:36,720
don't think that's ready yet but I know

00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:39,520
I know work is ongoing their crap police

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,400
that's a great big I love the nicknames

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,880
people come up with our IRC crabs police

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,180
says can we expect a facebook scope like

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,730
them like the I assume Twitter one we

00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,579
got with OTA eight that's a good

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,980
question I don't know actually yeah same

00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:00,420
here maybe you can just did have one in

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:05,800
the past didn't we I don't remember a

00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:08,500
telegram we do hmm hello there's a

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,420
Facebook photo skip that's the one ah ok

00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,740
I mean you sign off facebook and then

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,280
you can scroll through and see all the

00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:19,839
photos on your on your facebook stream I

00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,089
guess just testing that while you read

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,359
the next question yeah I mean you can

00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:28,300
also ask on the Ubuntu touch I NC

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,749
General maybe somebody there knows the

00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:35,769
answer to that

00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:39,579
okay I sorry I probably wouldn't be hard

00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:43,119
to repurpose the Facebook scope photos

00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:45,759
go to just be like your stream your your

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,470
new stream because all this is doing is

00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:52,329
just sharing photos if it showed like

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,640
updates that might be just as

00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,569
interesting lid on it and would mean you

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,640
know you don't necessarily need a

00:43:55,569 --> 00:44:02,130
Facebook am sorry carry on yeah an

00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,450
interesting question from co-op Belize

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,390
the unity a destined will receive

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:10,599
monthly updates like the phones or just

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:12,670
like the current method it's something I

00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:18,789
really didn't think about up until now

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:23,890
but sorry they open the unity eight the

00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:27,430
question yeah so um if you use ugh

00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:30,009
system in the future on your desktop and

00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,380
if you're going to also receive updates

00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:38,890
bundle like dota affect positive

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:42,579
features hmm I don't know what the

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:45,640
release strategy will be for unity a i

00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:49,180
would i would like to hope it's going to

00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:52,420
be based on snappy so applications can

00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:56,289
be updated and we would update like core

00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,660
components like unity mere and your wit

00:44:56,289 --> 00:45:01,239
so we would own knows your applications

00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,660
are set on top third-party developers

00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:07,210
own nose so if ya i keep joking whenever

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,279
people talk about future releases i joke

00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:12,190
on these qas about it being a rolling

00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:14,259
release we you know when we get towards

00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,880
like having snappy updates on our on our

00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:17,979
desktop system we're getting closer and

00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,319
closer towards that you know semi

00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:22,630
rolling release where you install it

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,479
once and then you just get updates

00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,769
updates updates updates all the time and

00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:28,869
i think we're getting closer to that i

00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:32,999
don't know what the plan is for unity a

00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:35,019
desktop but that seems reasonable to me

00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:39,819
yeah and let's see what it's going to be

00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:42,640
like any kids the desktop as we have it

00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:44,020
today it's going to continue to exist so

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,930
fall of this

00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:49,810
you out there who are no but afraid of

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:52,690
click and snap packages the Deaf world

00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:54,940
is going to stay but yeah there's going

00:45:52,690 --> 00:46:00,370
to be something like you t 8 desktop

00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:02,440
with OTA stuff I don't know but why not

00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:05,530
I mean we're going to live in a convert

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,360
world so I don't see why it should be

00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,530
happen like that and but some people

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,520
might not want to live in a converge

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:15,180
world or my other yeah like my thinkpad

00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,700
you know when it comes to I'm running

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:20,230
well actually I'm running 1604 now so I

00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,700
don't have to do the upgrade I'll just

00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,480
keep going until it gets to April and

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:28,200
then yeah I'm on the LTS yeah but people

00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,000
who are on the previous LTS like 1404 a

00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,100
short while after 1604 comes out they'll

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,070
get a notification that says hey 1604 is

00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:41,550
out join or upgrade and they can go from

00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:45,190
1404 to 60 or four and they'll get a you

00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:48,550
faster more stable you know more bug

00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,830
fixes like unity 7 based Debbie and

00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,320
desktop that's very similar to what

00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:55,840
they've got on 1404 but with newer staff

00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,730
and you know like I say bug fixes and

00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,890
performance improvement but it it won't

00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:03,310
be like oh my god got to relearn

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:06,280
everything because it's it's the same

00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:07,840
thing yeah so if you we're gonna have

00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,380
two tracts basically they'll be the

00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:13,540
snappy track and then there you know the

00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,980
expert or engineer or traditional or

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:22,090
whatever you want to call it debian

00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:27,400
desktop okay next question is from cool

00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:30,190
cat who asks why is sdl to why is sel to

00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:33,070
not installed and supported by default I

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,350
guess this is on the phone he says I

00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,820
have a really hard time with simple

00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:40,870
things like making the appt full screen

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,850
or loading an image that's all I think

00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,890
it would be great if all the the

00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:47,140
blockers you run into our stuff that is

00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,090
too hard if you mentioned this on the

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,710
mailing list or elsewhere I think it

00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:53,050
well great if you have that kind of

00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,600
feedback said I looked at everything and

00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:58,030
it's hard to have to use or it could be

00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:02,200
easier bring it up

00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:04,150
yep for this specific example though of

00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,340
stl too I think the reason it's not on

00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,900
the image is two reasons one is we try

00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,450
and keep the the base image as lean as

00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,830
possible and while sdl to is used by a

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,170
lot of things there are a lot of things

00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:17,170
that don't use it and so it will be an

00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,180
overhead on the device that the you know

00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,420
we might not want and it's actually not

00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:25,180
that hard to bundle a bunch of libraries

00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,920
into a quick package that you deploy and

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,600
you may have a version of stl to that

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,280
works for your app and someone else has

00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,960
a different custom version of sdl to

00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,780
that they need for their app so you can

00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,340
both have different copies of stl to in

00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,890
your cliq package to service that

00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,570
requirement and I appreciate that that

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,460
might be frustrating but it's the same

00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,250
answer that we give when someone says

00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,170
can i have you know pearl version

00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,410
whatever or Python version whatever all

00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:53,770
you know any other framework or toolkit

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,540
or library you bundle it in with a click

00:48:53,770 --> 00:49:00,280
that's the way that's the way we do it

00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:03,100
but for stl too though I would say you

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,130
have answered your own question it

00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:10,300
doesn't work properly yet on mere on a

00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:13,000
buncha phone and brenda schaefer who has

00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,270
done a lot of work to make stl to work

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,180
on mere still has some patches to land

00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:21,460
both upstream in stl and some things in

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,360
there in order to make it more robust so

00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,890
actually when we go back to that

00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,080
question that was what are you looking

00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,940
forward to an OTA nine one of the things

00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,750
I'm looking forward to is mere

00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:34,120
supporting sdl to better so that people

00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:39,520
like you can put your games on a buncha

00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:43,240
phone and they work I have answered your

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:47,050
question yes I appreciate you have a

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:49,510
hard time at you know it's frustrating I

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,190
I have the same pain I I've been trying

00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,070
to pour some sdl two things don't let

00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:56,250
your phone as well so I know I I feel

00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,250
your pain

00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:04,200
what's next Chloe wealthy go asked what

00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:05,700
plans other to mix scopes more useful

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,579
and engaging and I think we answered

00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,680
that earlier and the one hand the design

00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:12,540
team they're cooking up plans so that's

00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,809
in progress and and you can already

00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:20,880
start writing them with JavaScript which

00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:26,339
should be easier faster make more useful

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:28,619
ones yeah yeah so next one which wing

00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,480
asked I've been waiting over a month for

00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:33,059
you to community funding what's taking

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,240
so long and this shouldn't be the case

00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:39,530
where you can just ping pro pee on

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:43,140
myself afterwards all mm all my call on

00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:47,520
IRC and just give us the details it

00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:50,040
shouldn't take that long next question

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,230
is from cool cat have you heard the news

00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,559
about your luck going to the Death

00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:59,250
Valley what can I want to do to not meet

00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:04,670
yo la in the valley so this is an

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:09,329
interesting blog post from guy runs Jana

00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:10,380
and I think one of the important things

00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:11,910
that he's trying to highlight in the

00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,460
post was the fact that this is their

00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,349
third time heading for death valley and

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,589
they got out of it the last two times

00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:21,030
and there I think probably cautiously

00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:23,970
optimistic that they can get out of it

00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:27,089
again and I I hope they do because I

00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:31,619
think the world is better for a richer

00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:36,270
ecosystem of mobile platforms that isn't

00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:38,220
just Google and Apple yeah I I wish them

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:40,710
luck I I do hope they get their funding

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,049
for the end of the year and especially

00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,940
as you know you're and once your phone

00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:46,650
share some technologies so the more

00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,670
mobile devices that are using those

00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:53,760
technologies like pml-q like Hybris for

00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:55,589
example you know those kind of

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,730
technologies need to continue to be

00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:58,920
developed and it's only when there's

00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:03,230
multiple players in the game I think

00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,230
that they can keep driving that forward

00:52:04,049 --> 00:52:08,009
the follow-up part to that what can I

00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,449
want to do to not meet yola in the

00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:13,859
valley yeah probably ask mark that I

00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:18,289
mean one thing should be pretty obvious

00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:21,390
already would use success is not just

00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:24,329
measured by the number of phones which

00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:27,089
kid go out ubuntu is super successful in

00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:31,499
the cloud world they're still millions

00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:33,329
of pcs ship with ubuntu lots of

00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:35,369
companies based their business on a

00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:38,400
bluetooth so it's not just you who

00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:40,859
perform which has to be successful but

00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,989
obviously we all want conversions to

00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:47,130
happen like we want the phone to be

00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:50,009
successful as well but yeah who do

00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:54,749
successes is quite spread across various

00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:56,849
places right next question dragonbyte

00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:58,469
says is the move from unity 1788 going

00:52:56,849 --> 00:53:02,339
to be smoother than katie a three to

00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:05,309
four plasma five or gnome 2 3 or with a

00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:07,619
seventh windows 8 migration headaches or

00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:12,179
are they doomed to repeat history what

00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:14,519
we bet wails of pain and anguish ah you

00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:16,439
paint a pretty picture there I somebody

00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:21,179
mentioned the lord of the dragons as

00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:25,650
well i I don't know i like to hope that

00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:27,599
we'll do better and i know um you know

00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,779
that we can look back at what we did

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,880
with migration to unity like from known

00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:34,739
to to the unity and learn a lot from

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,119
that and I think we have learned a lot

00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:39,059
from that and I know mark has said

00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:41,579
multiple times on public q and A's that

00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:43,829
we're not going to shift to unity end to

00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:46,489
this ready until you know the community

00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:50,069
says it's like the right time to do it

00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:53,939
and i would like to hope that we have a

00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:57,349
migration path that's robust for people

00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,349
who are going from one to the other

00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:08,010
okay what's next look at us on Android

00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,170
you can now sell apps as low as 22 cents

00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,780
depending on the country and any plans

00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,700
to implement virtual currencies so we

00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,070
developers console an app that whatever

00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,990
price users will still have to pay a

00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:23,370
minimum sum that they can pay whatever

00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:26,790
the app costs get a visitor yeah yeah

00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:30,050
don't yeah it's a question which has

00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:35,790
been brought up a number of times and I

00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:40,920
but the last I heard was that we're

00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:42,570
asking for the minimum sum where all the

00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,740
transaction fees and that kind of stuff

00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:49,770
she'll make it work for us mm-hmm I

00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:53,490
think that's the reason why if we if we

00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:55,830
dropped right now with the user base

00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:00,150
that we have some thousands and

00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:03,900
thousands of ubuntu phones with hundreds

00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:05,610
of apps in the store and tens of paid

00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,700
apps in the store it doesn't become

00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:12,660
financially viable for us to drop the

00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:15,900
price yo the minimum like payment price

00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:19,260
for four apps because the transaction

00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:23,600
fees would just eat any you know profit

00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:26,250
made on those sales once there's a

00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,380
significant volume of phones out there a

00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:32,490
significant volume of apps in the school

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:34,260
it starts to become more viable and I

00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:37,170
think this is constantly being evaluated

00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,720
one thing that's that's been introduced

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:44,370
really really recently is in-app

00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:49,380
payments so with in-app payments you

00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:51,990
could for example you provide a version

00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,150
of your app which is completely free but

00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:57,540
then had an in-app purchase to upgrade

00:55:54,150 --> 00:56:00,240
to you no more levels in the game or the

00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:03,570
paid version or app which takes away nag

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,600
screens or you know gives you more space

00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,940
or more time or whatever you might be

00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,710
done but right now the minimum price is

00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,000
not is not coming down in there in the

00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:19,890
short term as I understand

00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:22,110
I it cook at us any news on beacuse

00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:24,660
Russian launch does Putin love the big

00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:27,660
you would deform think preaching is a

00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:29,070
bit busy right now maybe well maybe yeah

00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,720
I don't think he's returned our calls

00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:35,670
right yeah that's that's not to say

00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:41,820
anything about our phone not being able

00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:43,530
to accept calls Ridge ring asks who has

00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,110
Star Wars tickets no I should have

00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:53,910
bought some for its in a few weeks isn't

00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:57,420
it nak about is that neck a nut I'll

00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:59,340
asks is blue chief FTP and plug-ins for

00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,090
farmers your gallery being actively

00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:07,680
worked on for one to touch that's good

00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:09,480
question no we have just just migrated

00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,240
to blues five so there has been a big

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:16,830
like change in the Bluetooth stack just

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:19,170
over the last few weeks that's an

00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:23,430
interesting interesting question of not

00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:30,210
i don't think i've used bluetooth file

00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:32,100
transfer for about 10 years so it's

00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,750
interesting i don't know you know how

00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,700
often that's used we recently

00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,920
implemented samba support in the file

00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,020
manager and i would imagine we'd

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,770
implement things like NFS and stuff like

00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:46,170
that you know other really really

00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,910
popular things and i think we'd have to

00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:51,210
make a really good use case for doing

00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:53,190
file transfer via bluetooth and things

00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:55,020
like that I don't know how reliable they

00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,000
are I I like like I say I haven't used

00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,940
it for 10 years so I just don't know i

00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,560
mean if if you have access to to Wi-Fi

00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:07,520
can use stewart's app yeah there's the

00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:10,980
Wi-Fi transfer app or you can use SCP

00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,350
you know you can SCP files I SCP files

00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,600
to and from my phone all the time using

00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:18,330
an ssh key I find that so you'd be

00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,840
useful but then you know i'm a nerd so

00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,840
yeah

00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:31,109
next question reggin by the dragon bike

00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:36,060
is unity 8 going to be better for gaming

00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:38,700
or the same as unity 7 I don't know good

00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,040
Iver it's going to be interesting I mean

00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:47,090
you it is going to run with with mere

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:50,100
and yeah don't know of any benchmarks

00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,920
seriously comparing games to each other

00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:55,470
I don't know i'd imagine faronics will

00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,170
be all over that yeah I'm good you an

00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:00,240
exhibit yeah oh yeah I think Michael

00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:04,290
maribel will will sort that out will

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:06,210
answer that question um Chloe asks I

00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,580
have any of you got a steam machine and

00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,380
what do you think of it and how it will

00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:15,350
affect game another 12 and a bunch of

00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:19,830
option um I don't have a steam machine I

00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:24,630
do use steam though I think the whole

00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:28,050
idea of running games on linux more

00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,850
games being available for Linux will be

00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:32,840
pushed once there are more steam

00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:36,090
machines on the market and there you

00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:39,180
available all over the place rather than

00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:41,010
just in a couple of markets not sure

00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:44,250
that will affect ubuntu adoption but it

00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:47,430
will certainly make it more attractive

00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:49,260
to switch on the desktop from Windows to

00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:54,990
Bunty if there are more games available

00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:58,410
hiking yep oh my gosh where I left at

00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:04,980
halftime are there any super interesting

00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:06,630
questions we can pick out and I can't

01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:13,109
see anything that's not something we've

01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:15,119
answered already I could burn through

01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,470
three of them really really quickly when

01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,780
can we have physical a bunch of stores

01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:23,670
don't know any plans for a bun to edge

01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:25,350
two point oh no aah anyway to get more

01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:28,500
apps on Richie phones plans like deals

01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:31,470
with companies such as Facebook or games

01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,109
yes we are talking to commercial

01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,830
partners all the time about porting

01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:37,590
their games across

01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:44,970
tell them to add the apps and games at

01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:47,270
torrenting watch this space cool yep wow

01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:50,340
so many Christians thank you everyone

01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:54,120
sorry we didn't get to all of them I

01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,950
might next week and maybe ask I don't

01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,520
know Daniel or whoever's going to be

01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:03,300
here next week no David or Nick or Mike
