00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,909
and doing packing a package and I so

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
testing I've helped triage bugs and test

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,259
for new bugs it helped people over

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,540
mailing list i receive written some

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,140
documentation and I've helped test

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,250
releases and write release announcements

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,030
if you ever need to contact me my

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,909
details are on the screen what is

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,820
looking to bug day it has been on a hug

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,400
day an event that is used to get to is

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,799
used that used to be held to get people

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,560
to triage more bugs the official wiki

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,780
page says quote the term hug days it's

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,790
been on hug on bug day every time

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,970
someone tree edge vs bug then someone

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,619
else should hug him or her why this is a

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,540
very special wait for us to tell

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,460
everyone that we love contributions and

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,640
triaging bugs is a really big

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,469
contribution for the spin on bug day our

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,750
processes are a tiny bit different than

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,969
usual boat triaging I'll get into this

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,229
in a bit where is this event being held

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,149
this event will be held on the hatch

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,120
lubuntu dash developed anolon freenode

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,500
if you need an IRC client a link is a is

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,180
on the screen

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,770
there will be people there who will be

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,060
able to help you as well as some team

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,730
members that might be around depending

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,340
on time zones you might see the

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,370
following people online from the team to

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,730
Liam Julian is a release manager and

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,680
he's the development lead of Lou to

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,630
Walter he's the release Mejias release

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,620
manager and is the QA lead of loop into

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,600
he's also here with me and Rafael he's

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:46,920
the artwork he's the artwork lead of

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:49,420
Lupin to how is this bugged a difference

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,459
the hog day page states of the bug

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,500
triage should happen on hash lagoon to

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,540
dash bugs on freenode our bug day will

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,970
be held on hash saloon to Lubuntu dash

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,620
to bail on freenode in addition to a

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,810
different channel our process will be a

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,510
little bit different as well you sure

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,160
triage the bug is usual first then make

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,170
sure that the lube into packages team is

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,000
subscribed to the bug this ensures that

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,459
all the team members can see the changes

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,830
you just made to the bug after that you

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,870
should check the knowns known bugs list

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,180
to see if it exists there if it doesn't

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,370
exist at it on the table if it does

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,459
exist check if the table is correct if

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,060
it is move on if it isn't corrected now

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,450
I'm going to give you a little

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,579
demonstration of how to triage a bug if

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,350
you are following along you need to

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,959
create a launchpad account with the link

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,880
given on screen also if you're going to

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,130
edit the known bugs page you need an

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,780
ubuntu wiki account and you need to be

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,760
in the room to be kieta dirty mon

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,100
launchpad use the link on the screen to

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:57,269
go to this team's page and apply let's

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:57,269
get started um over here I have a bug

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,459
it's affecting numeric let's take a look

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,519
at this bug report first lutheran two

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,579
packages team is already subscribed so

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,340
we don't need to do anything with that

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,829
so this bug report says to reproduce

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,450
launch numeric on 1604 the current

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,269
development release and then the menu

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,890
help selects about numeric a fancy

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,050
dialogue with the link to the numeric

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,940
website appears and has a fancy

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,070
animation of the developer names however

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,320
at the bottom there's a button that says

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,940
that I that I click on it and nothing

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,850
happens so let's scroll down on this bug

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,470
report this shows that this bug is so

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:47,550
present in Ubuntu 1604 amd64 build this

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:50,110
is in December she over here I have some

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,970
virtual machines I have a trustee

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,300
virtual machine I have a zinnia virtual

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,930
machine and a yakety virtual machine

00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,690
let's test and see if this still exists

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,900
so here on this yak need machine here um

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,590
I just installed the boot to desktop

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,560
package so let me reboot that and let me

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:16,260
go do different vm for now over here is

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,260
the yakety p.m. so let me login here

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:25,300
that isn't good but let's ignore that

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,190
for now I've used this vm before so I've

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,840
kind of set up the screen resolution and

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,760
stuff like that so let's open numeric

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,110
cancel want that for now I'll report the

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,180
bugs later so let's do what it said if i

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,760
remember it was about and then license

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,640
it looks like that bug does still exist

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,330
so we can confirm that this bug still

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:56,410
exists on yakety and yes these these

00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:05,850
installations are fully updated now

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:09,250
let's login to the zoo niall install and

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:14,850
we'll do the exact same thing go over to

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:18,970
office numeric and help about license

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,240
yep that bug still exists now just to

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,390
note although it does really help to

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,970
have virtual machines to have a bunch of

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:31,630
of instances of Lubuntu such as i have

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:37,210
here like acne Zinio trusty it you

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:40,190
really do not need it it helps a lot but

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,870
it really isn't essential

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,290
you just have to indicate sony respond

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:57,300
to the bug report so let's see there we

00:06:46,290 --> 00:07:05,550
go here's the trustee BM and oh there's

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:08,940
Mouse problems and expect this um just

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:13,560
seems like I can't click anything that's

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,960
a little bit weird um so I'm gonna say

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,270
for now I cannot I can't confirm

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,650
anything on this because this VM is

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,410
obviously there's obviously an issue

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:26,250
with it I'll have to do reinstall later

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:30,840
and confirm the bug then but for now i

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:33,240
can confirm fat on the z niall image and

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,480
on the yakety image this issue does

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,150
exist so let's go over here to launch

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,600
pad um it seems like I'm not logged in

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:46,980
right now but it okay i'm already logged

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,420
in so i'm gonna come down here making

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,280
sure the libram two packages team is

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,490
subscribed so at first let's look at

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,720
this this bug does affect me so I'm

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,680
going to come up here I'm going to mark

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:04,380
yes it affects me so this bug affects

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:07,080
you and three other people so I could I

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,320
could revise the bug description to make

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,410
it a little bit better worded but right

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:19,860
now I'm just going to look at this so

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:20,820
statuses confirms and that's good um so

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm going to come over here to add

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:28,380
comments i'm going to i'm going to write

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:39,990
something like this is confirmed in two

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:41,190
days yakety and Zeo images um and in

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,840
parentheses here i'm going to put

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,839
because it's in the same format is that

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:52,190
I'm not used to doing that 2016 07 and

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,190
today is the 25th

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,610
so this is chris is confirmed in today's

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:06,920
yeah Keynes TVL images um someone post

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:09,890
the comment there we go so let's also

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,050
come up here and look at this this

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,270
description right here so I'm going to

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:22,510
select that it i'm going to write

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:28,040
something along the lines of reproduce

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:31,160
launch numeric because this is a little

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,980
bit worded bad so I'm going to have to i

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,339
would like to revise this to make make

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,310
it so that other people can other people

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,770
can look at this and understand what the

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,459
problem is and maybe somebody needs to

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,290
be able to fix it so although his air

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,209
was clear enough that I could find what

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,520
the problem was I'd like to make this a

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:56,360
little bit clearer so to reproduce let's

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:59,630
launched good new numeric to reproduce

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:08,270
I'll make this up what kinda dress s why

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:11,120
not launch numeric step 2 so let's go

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:17,560
back to my yak vvm and let's let's step

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:24,529
by step to make sure it's correct um so

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:30,520
go to help go to the help menu and

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,520
select out

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:56,770
select the license button on the dialog

00:10:45,070 --> 00:11:03,970
box that pops on the bottom of i log Bob

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:07,300
step-papa pops up expected I actually

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,720
haven't seen this this work correctly so

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm going to assume that it I'm just

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:27,990
going to be big here and say that this

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:27,990
shows license information shows numerics

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,850
this it's information and actual results

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:51,220
button is pressed down but it does

00:11:46,180 --> 00:12:02,530
nothing now if I launch this from a

00:11:51,220 --> 00:12:04,720
terminal which I could do Mara and I do

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,620
the same thing let's see if it gives an

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,080
additional output that would be helpful

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:16,950
so it's talking about couldn't connect

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:23,940
to accessibility bus in the console

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:26,940
output if he claims about not being able

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,940
to

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:42,260
x 26 plus let's let's see if this is if

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:44,420
this issues just with nope i'm not i'm

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,250
not going to put that because that that

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:53,839
outputted right when it launched it so

00:12:46,250 --> 00:13:00,760
i'm a there's nothing so i can say this

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:06,470
bug report and i can close these and

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:13,970
I'll shut these down later bye but

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:15,830
otherwise there we go um now i want to

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,220
show you kind of where i find where i

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:22,040
can then where you can find some bugs to

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,720
triage wait before i do that there's one

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,260
more step that I had to do I almost

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,810
forgot about this um so here's the known

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:36,230
bugs page ID login to the moon to wiki

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:38,120
earlier um now can click Edit so i can

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,140
create a new table entry so what I'm

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,440
going to do is come up here copy paste

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,630
because the format is bug named bug

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,890
number packages affected has work rounds

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,860
or comments if if there's any specific

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,860
comments so that's the name of the bug

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:02,330
report I think it's good enough for now

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:05,000
rug number um do what I like to do is

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:09,410
there's this thing that Daniel Oh box

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,330
showed me called CAD data lv it's a URL

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,640
shortener for a launch pad and I think

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,410
it's really really convenient to use so

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,170
I'm just going to copy paste this down

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:29,650
here take this number right here and

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:34,660
paste this close that's table entry um

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:41,329
then what packages does it affect if X

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:43,870
there and this as it doesn't have a

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,600
workaround no

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,360
oh that's I'm just going to leave that

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,760
blank now let me see it changes hoping

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,100
that the wiki actually likes to save the

00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,779
changes there we go so oh I just added

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:05,730
it to the table than if i click this in

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:09,070
in in a little bit of time this pops up

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,240
cool so now i'm going to show you what i

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,410
was going to when i was talking about a

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,850
little bit before me refresh their non

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,920
logged in so the loop into packages team

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,870
it has the bugs that are related to

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,589
group to Lubuntu now if i go to

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,940
subscribe bugs this is all the bugs it's

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,589
the same amount but it's all the votes

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,250
that the liberties packages team is

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:37,950
subscribe to so there's for example this

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,750
bug which does in facts impact Abby word

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:45,700
that the text cursor starts to flicker

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:48,760
after adding some text so here is sort

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,270
of where we keep track of where the bugs

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,950
are this is there's also some test cases

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:59,459
down here some manual test cases um but

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,690
if you're looking to triage some bugs it

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:07,570
would be really good to look through

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:11,709
this list because um some of these I

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:15,220
don't even think are reported on any

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:18,610
place so looking for this list would

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:25,720
really be good it's bugs out Launchpad

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:31,540
nets / tilde Lubuntu dash packaging then

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,339
we go to a b-word this this package is a

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,830
good example of a package that you can

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:40,779
look at that's included in in Lubuntu

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:44,790
that has it it's a package that needs

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:47,920
triaging the bugs need triaging so I

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,779
triage some bugs about a month or two

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,839
ago and there's some bugs in here that

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,840
are a year too old that would really be

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,660
good to get triage

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,150
um I think some of them some of them are

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,290
older than 2 years so we really need to

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,570
get these triaged and look through

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,090
specifically a b-word but also just look

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:13,000
for the bug list for or any other

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:16,030
package that's included in by default in

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,710
Lubuntu so here is bugs that

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:23,950
launchpad.net / kubuntu / + source / in

00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:26,550
the package name and then this will

00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,750
let's see what happens if i delete this

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:35,350
right here so if i delete this i'm

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:41,350
looking to see if it actually if perfect

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:42,520
just meet this page so there are a bunch

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,990
of applications that do you need

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:52,240
triaging um and I think this is pretty

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:56,650
much it for my presentation so um I'm

00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:03,070
gonna switch over to my webcam e here we

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:05,020
go so let's let me look through the hmm

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,260
looks like this is gonna remind

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,420
everybody um if you have questions for

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,820
Simon or for Walter they're here to

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,860
answer them live on the air all you have

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,590
to do is ask them in the IRC channel

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,050
which again is hash a bun to hyphen on

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,370
hyphen air on freenode or if you're on a

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,560
bun to on-air it should be right below

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,870
the video start your question with the

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,510
word question and all caps and that way

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:34,480
it won't be missed in the meantime while

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,880
we wait can you talk a little bit about

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,400
the lube into project in general how its

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,960
organized and what makes it different

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,000
from the other a bun two flavors well

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,270
lubuntu is kind of unique because we're

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,290
we're a small team um we don't have many

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:56,370
people behind the scenes there's like

00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:00,100
Walter who does like release management

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:04,390
release manages MIT release management

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,850
stuff there we go and some QA stuff I do

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:11,020
sort of the same thing

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:14,200
um Julian does development Rafael does

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,390
artwork but then there there isn't

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,520
anybody with any like official positions

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,850
there's Brendan Piron who does QA

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,800
sometimes there's a neo also but we're

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,130
we're a small team we don't have many

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:33,550
people so we are resources aren't spread

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:36,780
out a lot um we have again we have the

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:38,890
artwork team which Raphael heads um I

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,860
don't know specifically how he adds that

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:45,670
but we have we have something specific

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,980
that were we're kind of looking forward

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,570
to and we kind of have to keep in mind

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,570
is work

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:59,019
yeah alex you know if you saw my screen

00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:03,999
but I'm actually running LX cutie right

00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:06,700
now um it's it's a fairly it's it's a

00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:09,730
really good desktop but we have to kind

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,779
of prepare for the gtk to QT transition

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:17,230
and so we have some packages in the

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,850
archive right now but we it's not we

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,289
don't have an image yet we it isn't

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:30,309
supported so you have let me in fact I

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:34,539
should probably um this up we have some

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,580
blueprints over here um rinsed out

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:41,499
launchpad.net let me just check over

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,029
there but um there's blueprints over

00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:47,200
here that have a bunch of Alex cutie

00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:48,970
stuff so for example let's look at or oh

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:55,509
you can't see my screen let me screen

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:58,720
share here so like I said running Alex

00:20:55,509 --> 00:21:04,830
cutie but we have the blueprints over

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:09,669
here that let's just go to the Qt course

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:18,149
current Canada delic CT so um let's go

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:21,639
to something more like browser down here

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,970
so we have blueprints over here that

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,970
have

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:37,230
we have blueprints over here that have

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:40,110
like your outgoing okay um you can I do

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:43,320
the candidate currently of what we plan

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:47,070
on using and then the proposals of what

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,030
we can use like Firefox is not cutie

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,440
based chromium not PT based on coop jela

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:57,540
is cutie based no que te dependencies

00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,090
but it's not as widely uses firefox to

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,800
chromium and doesn't support html5 which

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:08,310
is a major thing um and then we have

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,880
some other some other different options

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:14,340
here we had a little discussion so so

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,950
that's a unique transition that that

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,340
we're going through right now um we

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,210
really have to keep in mind xqt moving

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,670
forward it's but it's been something

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,690
that we we've been looking to transition

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,760
to for a while now but we haven't um

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,340
more it's it's it's just because elks

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:43,950
cutie isn't just isn't ready enough to

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:46,620
transition to yet so um yeah it's it

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,440
there's really not much more of to

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:57,690
describe of how the Lubuntu team works

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:59,550
um we we just we have like I said we

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:04,170
have a small team there's not much to it

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:07,020
um I'll release management I usually

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,090
write some release notes near Walter or

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,020
some or the community kind of sometimes

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,900
contributes but we write release notes

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,590
and then we we have like a subreddit

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:22,010
stuff like that that we pose to um but

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,870
yeah there's really not much else to it

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:28,750
to kind of answer what you said Michael

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,120
alright well we don't have any questions

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,760
so what we'll do is this video has been

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,860
recorded so we'll put it up it'll be on

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,240
YouTube it'll be on a bunt one air for a

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,030
while and we'll pass it around social

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,580
media so for anybody who comes back and

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,640
watches this later can you one more time

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,950
say when the bug day is going to be and

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,559
where it's going to happen it's going to

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,240
be tomorrow and the coordination is

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,680
going to happen in the loop in to

00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:01,059
develop channel on so it's let me screen

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,679
share this again um like if i can press
