and we sure hope today and we were

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,430

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,939
just a few minutes or otherwise the

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,520
questions that we cannot answer will

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,730
answer let me channel that's good that's

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,950

there's the video feed below that you

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,559
have the the chat widget just use your

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,160
favorite nickname eat the connect button

we're looking forward to your questions

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,100
just make sure you prefix them with

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,820
question in all caps so we can more

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,149
easily pick them up and ya later on you

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,700
can also circle subscribe friends and

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,490
follow all the booboo on account you can

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,790
find is that way you get informed about

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:19,850
new shows all chose and you get to see

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:23,400
all the good that's getting out Oh

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:28,369
continue with the news shall we start

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:32,430
with hinting at let's start syndicate

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,799
Michael on the call today think he wants

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,090
to tell us about new stock images that

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,490
are just landed sure happy to so um so

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,939
as you know is a lot of people now and

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,530
since NAT D is is it's a very

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,549
interesting relatively new piece of

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,159
software where you can install

00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:55,740
applications to your desktop after this

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,920
table and given to an has been released

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:03,780
and so it's really nice so you get stuff

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,960
like critter and so on but we also we

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,259
also work on on images that are purely

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,580
built based on snaps so instead of the

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,500
traditional

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:19,050
approach where you have a bunch of tabs

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:24,170
yes you are you're based system this is

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:30,420
a system where you basically run three

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:33,360
snaps gadget kernel and core and this

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,520
has some interesting consequences for

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
example we can upgrade the entire

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,540
operating system in a pretty much atomic

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,810
way we can roll back to previous

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,140
versions so this makes it did the whole

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,320
snap technology makes it done makes it

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,970
very suitable for say embedded systems

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:57,450
or systems that have a very high

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,520
requirement on reliability and we have

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,770
been working on this very very actively

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,459
in the last couple of months and the

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,870
second beta version of this feature is

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:12,959
now available so we have images for PC

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:16,640
amd64 and I 386 and also for the pie to

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,459
the PI 3 and the dragon board so all the

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:25,489
big four architectures like arm 32 and

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,900
64 and pc 32 and 64 bits are available

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,790
and yeah we are we are quite excited

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,790
about this it's pretty good stuff

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,560
Michael quick question the new images

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,140
they're all available acting on

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,530
developer total intercom farm and

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,630
parkland right so so hosted on CD image

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,670
that you want or comic but I believe

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,590
there are links on developer don't you

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,739
want to come and if not we should

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,170
certainly add links it is you know it is

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,000
a little bit rough in some areas it's

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,600
not it's not perfect it's not super

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,170
stable yet but the important part is if

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,880
the foundations are a good I think and

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,250
you know the rough edges is mostly

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,299
polish stuff where you know I don't know

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,600
the output is not super nice or features

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,700
that are just not fully done yet but

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,200
conceptually I think this is this is

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,200
really good and solid at this point

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,780
excellent so other than the image is

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,270
standing I think we had a couple of

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,770
other week announcements to make before

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:40,280
we get into questions yes so at the oh

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:44,150
no end of October we're going to have

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:48,170
the boon to release and just some time

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:51,170
after time for another online summit is

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,960
where we get to discuss the direction of

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,570
the new raley's also celebrate all the

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,830
goodness that has has has ended in

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,990
yakety yak so that's very likely just

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,600
waiting for for last confirmations all

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,490
the last objections that's going to

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,080
happen in the week of the 14th of

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:15,470
november so if you have big topics to

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,300
discuss for for the next release that's

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,500
that's the best time to to invite

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,940
everyone bring them all to the same

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,400
table and discuss things there and at

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,640
the end of precisely this week there's

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,900
going to be through the book on europe

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,910
so that's going to happen in essence

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,370
that's going to be from the 18th through

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,400
the front gate of november so the

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:44,690
weekend starting with a social event on

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,490
the on friday night so if you're in in

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,290
Germany at the time or if you can make

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,910
it there it's going to be brilliant

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,440
isn't going to have loads of people

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,770
there workshops talks you get to do to

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,030
meet all the great people that James ill

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:04,010
but it's going to be there we're going

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:08,690
to have lots of folks Dave what are your

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,100
highlight spot for the event ah we're

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,010
gonna have to create speakers as you

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,650
mentioned we're going to have Jane

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,320
interchangeable CEO of canonical we're

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,140
going to have folks from the volunteer

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,540
open to community some of them from

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,550
Europe summons them coming from the US

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,070
and other parts where you can have

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,480
Microsoft folks throughout there too and

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,320
we're going to have some folks from

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,950
other companies so the event will be

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,280
packed

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,200
we talk something we've got about three

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,300
or four different tracks there were lots

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,820
of rooms on that on the at the venue and

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,190
and also it will be a great way to meet

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,960
people from the community who you either

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,960
haven't seen for a while or that you

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,000
have met in person yet the social event

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,580
will be will be quite nice to get to

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,480
know everyone before the text that sorry

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,960
for talks start on on Friday but yes

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,870
certainly if your SN or if you can make

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:15,560
it to us in November it's definitely

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:18,620
worth going ok all right um so we could

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:25,400
one in first question and I think I'm

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:28,670
gonna start with that one but perhaps i

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,130
will ask first Michael a question you

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,020
even do a proper introduction Michael

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:39,860
could you tell us what you what you do

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:41,780
at 02 / canonical sure and so these days

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm and I'm pretty much working

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:49,660
exclusively on on snappy on the snappy

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,090
system on making it making it happen on

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,910
images right now we are pushing really

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:59,120
hard to make the image story really

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,060
solid but but it's the desktop is also

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,100
quite important and also the server side

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:11,180
and it's it's kind of it's kind of nice

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:13,820
I mean so when so I'm obviously I'm you

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,220
know developing stuff for for Stephie

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,440
person ft but i'm also an upstream for

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:23,510
stuff that i just wrote right in my

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:26,000
spare time and then you know what one

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,300
example is a little to encroach go

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,280
DeeDee which is like a trivial

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,530
application that basically does what DD

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,479
does except that it's a little bit a

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,510
little bit more user friendly right i

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,060
mean DD is super nice it's a tool to

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,360
write whatever you want to wear that you

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,660
wanted to so usually you use it to write

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,870
a an image file to a block device that

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,460
too

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,580
you are basically take take the

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,760
downloaded image for your pie tool and

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,220
put it on an SD card now DD is like I

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,940
said super powerful but it's also super

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,510
dangerous like because if you if you get

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,760
you know it def SD a instead of SD be

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,710
you are then you are basically

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,540
overriding your main hard disk and GD

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,730
we're not care right it's the training

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,140
us root it just goes full steam ahead

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,520
and there goes your system so DeeDee and

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,990
and this always bother me right because

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,790
obviously you know we want people have a

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,010
good experience when testing our images

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,380
and I said you know a single misplaced

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,170
leather shouldn't destroy your system so

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,750
go DeeDee is 11 answer to this it will

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,940
basically just check before it writes if

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,770
you're if it would write to a mounted

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,410
file system or a plot device that has

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:47,630
mounted file systems on it and it will

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:50,750
just refuse to do it so but go dt was

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:55,339
written after the senior was released

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,320
right after 1604 so I had this I had

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:00,950
this challenge like how do i distribute

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,680
it to my users and and and snaps a

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,650
really really nice way of fixing this

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,720
problem it took me like I don't know ten

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,220
minutes to create a snap craft file i

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,470
use the we go plug in and we go snap

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,290
craft plug-in pointed it to make it

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,540
directory and type snap craft and it can

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,150
all change along happily for a couple of

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,900
minutes and and that was it really and

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,700
now the instructions for how to test

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,880
images are much nicer basically you type

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,770
snap install go DeeDee and a little bit

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,380
of extra magic and and you have an

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,200
application and I'm unhappy as an

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,920
upstream because I distributed my

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,440
application to all the 1604 users in the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,610
world without having to bother about you

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,890
know by parting or requesting a review

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,240
and and all of this stuff like the store

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,220
is doing it automatically uploading new

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,050
revisions is really slick and

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:09,470
fast so so yeah mama I'm a happy

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,569
snappity snap the user so let's but

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,350
let's circle back so yeah I work on one

00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:17,480
snap d mainly on images but also on the

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,100
desktop and also on the server and I

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,189
think the server use case is also a bit

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,399
under under appreciated at this point

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:27,819
because I think snap snaps are really

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,189
powerful when it comes to deploying

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,839
server use cases because because it has

00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:35,660
all the nice properties of containers

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:40,730
like it's self-contained you can you can

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:42,680
upgrade it atomically but it's also it

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,720
took at least to me like like very

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,920
simple conceptually like to understand

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,470
it's basically like you know if you

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,600
explain it to someone it's like yeah

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:55,370
it's a it's a it's a it's a Supt I you

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,889
know squashed version of you are of your

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,870
of your file tree and you just run it

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:01,610
int and that's that's all there is to it

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,220
wait of course there is more to it but I

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,309
mean this is all the hard parts we try

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,420
to hide behind behind snapdeal so nobody

00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:12,800
nobody has to bother about it I guess

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,559
that was a bit of a detour but the

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,250
didn't answer your question or kool-aid

00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:21,170
answered my question very very very very

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,350
detailed so that's Michael fought for

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:29,990
you master of snap tea and failure of

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:31,879
video storage and car systems oh I

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,519
wasn't sure if you had seen the question

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,350
from Simon quickly from three or four

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,670
hours ago yeah that's what I was going

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:43,069
from so Michael gave was the accurate

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,870
question of what which is working on for

00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:48,079
us geeks it's probably the first one

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:52,009
that we would be looking for but here's

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,459
the trick so Simon quickly was a regular

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:57,439
at the Q&A can't make it to the V&A

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:01,040
delay but he posted a question in

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,139
advance a few hours ago and essentially

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,029
it was asking how do you explain your

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,920
job to people we don't know much about

00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:12,019
technology would specifically do you

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,480
tell them what you do haha it's a

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,220
question for me or for well

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,610
let's leave you if you rest for a bit

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,800
and perhaps start with Daniel and we can

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,389
answer each one of us okay that's a

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,940
brilliant question ok to me first now ok

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:36,800
or I can go for 7 line i think i would

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:40,430
say i'm helping developers to get their

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,420
software to users that's probably what I

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,040
would say it and like I don't know the

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,970
two of you could basically say the same

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,519
thing right yeah it's always about about

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,680
helping people and for me in my case it

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,560
developed always into like having our

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,269
conversation so it's a really good

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,540
conversation starter with people you

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,130
don't know we have when I start start

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,620
telling them about with open source is

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:10,120
and it's generally people who are not

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,730
familiar with open source or so or our

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,130
code development and that's where it

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,990
starts and then I tell them about

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,970
working with volunteers they are really

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,720
surprised about people working on

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,019
something together for no apparent

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,540
economical benefit and then essentially

00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:36,260
tell them we help people to contribute

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,060
to to Ludo as in an opera to every

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,639
operating system and whatever they

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,190
contribute the and take a lead back my

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,940
job and our job is to make it easier for

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,290
them to to contribute and and to make

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,079
sure that the hunt is better for

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:55,910
everyone so it's normalize the like five

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:58,610
cents generally saying that's

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,800
interesting so when people ask me I

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,069
usually say I do stuff with computers

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,899
and the end most of the time that that

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:10,699
pretty much cut the conversation but but

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,310
yeah sometimes people do ask like what

00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:17,740
specifically and then yes I do talk

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:20,480
about programming and um and then again

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,640
most of the people stopped being

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,890
interested because you know it is

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,220
already quite abstract and then when I

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,860
when I talk about you know building

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm basically an operating system

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,920
basically really finding I mean snap

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,710
snap t itself is quite nice but the

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,030
snappy system if you think about it from

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:47,120
a coma from a more holistic from a more

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:51,560
success system yesh kind of standpoint

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,420
it is actually rebuilding how we how we

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,680
make an operating system into a certain

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,990
extent I minutes it is it is quite

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:04,130
remarkable actually I mean because you

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,680
know we have we traditionally we had all

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:11,000
these these files lying around on disk

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,980
and and and and in a lot of ways of

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,110
snappy systems so much more tidy because

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,840
we have like if you look at the raw disk

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,740
you'll see pretty much three files that

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,930
gadget kernel and os but you know once

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,570
once you start going there then you

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,550
pretty much lose most of the people

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,310
because it's a way to detail and

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,640
abstract but yeah I do love talking

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,430
about it it's just it's difficult to

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,960
find a blue appreciated but I love my

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,090
team because my team loves to talk about

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,670
this stuff and we talk about it all the

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:50,990
time of course excellent thank my car

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:56,420
all right circular motion from who can

00:16:50,990 --> 00:17:00,080
snaps access mirror and and yes so we

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,330
have a mirror interface um so snaps are

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,030
snaps again are really interesting in

00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,760
other ways and are different from from

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:13,820
traditional the traditional way of doing

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:17,450
stuff on on Linux because the access to

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,980
resources is more restricted or maybe

00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,610
not restrict is probably not the right

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:27,050
word more control it is the better one

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:31,820
so by default a snap that does not need

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:33,380
more access like take for example an

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,200
application that needs to access the

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,540
network like in the fields all or a game

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,779
like all it all it does is try stuff on

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,669
the screen then it really needs no

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,759
access to your home directory needs no

00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:50,149
access to a file system to any of this

00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:53,509
stuff so we we can find it by default it

00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:56,499
can't access stuff but we also have a

00:17:53,509 --> 00:18:01,399
concept called interfaces which allows

00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:05,179
22 for a snap to basically asked for

00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,649
access to additional resources and and

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,960
one of these interfaces is the mirror

00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:11,659
interface and and i believe it's it's

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:17,539
working I I personally have not tested

00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:19,759
it but yeah I think it's it's good cool

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,839
Lucy Coe a lot of questions coming up

00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,489
for a snappy and so thing most of the

00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,889
people who are asking are probably

00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:29,749
already familiar with with it but just

00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,690
before we continue with the next

00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:35,389
question if you want to know more about

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,669
snappy and and the snap architecture and

00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:40,279
what snaps are I would recommend you to

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,619
go to snap crafted I oh we're and basic

00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,809
concepts are explained and then you Gary

00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,279
you'll find it tutorial as well how to

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:51,469
get started creating your first snaps

00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:54,769
alright so we've got another question

00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:56,570
from another regular this time from the

00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:02,289
other side of the fence that's Michael

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:04,969
ho one of our Q&A hosts is asking what

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:09,019
applications services do you run do you

00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:11,710
run from a snap today I guess that's

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:16,429
another one for you Michael for me ok

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,379
yeah it's funny it is funny because like

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:21,589
I said earlier this kind of morphed in

00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:23,960
an unexpected in an unexpected way so

00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:26,869
some some people who who know me for

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,940
longer know that I am also but I am

00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:30,849
still at the toy lesser extent but I

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,859
used to be very much involved in inept

00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:36,409
and that packaging and and and this is

00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:39,859
still near and dear to my heart so I you

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:42,169
know I you know I was expecting that

00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:44,570
snaps are brilliant but they are really

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,019
you know for the big big applications

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,809
where packaging regional snaps funded

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,269
stuff so so if you if you if you package

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,679
a huge java application for example it

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,360
makes a lot of sense to you snaps

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,210
because you

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,720
the dependencies I know Jas is another

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,760
one there where the dependencies are so

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,760
dynamic it's really hard to model it in

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,650
the traditional depth way of things so

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,170
this was my expectation actually so you

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:14,080
know snapped up brilliant for the big

00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,330
stuff and packaging packaging is is

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,480
still used for a lot of the you know

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,400
traditional stuff go DeeDee again it

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,150
kind of changed my mind but it's not

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,400
only go DeeDee it's it's really so a lot

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,669
of the small tools I use and I write for

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,770
myself or for for other people they

00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:38,380
morphed into snaps because of the East

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:41,230
to distribute stuff I personally run for

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,110
example we have a very very nice

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,850
integration test or basically it's a

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,260
task execution system but it's and we

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,880
use it as a test runner it's called

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,030
spread its written by Gustav unnimaya

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,580
and it's it's really really nice if you

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:58,030
need to do testing black integration

00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:01,750
test system tests it's a really cool and

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:04,330
easy to use way to run it and and yeah

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:08,770
we be Gustavo puts out a snap and we use

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:11,470
the snap of spread so a lot of the stuff

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,450
that i use for my day-to-day development

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,309
actually comes from snaps like you want

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,790
your image is another one like when we

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:21,880
build snap the images images you know

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,309
for for the old snap system they are

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,750
built from from a snap and again you put

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,660
your images maybe even a better example

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,020
then then go DeeDee because you but your

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,500
image is so it's a really nice price on

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:39,730
application and in order for it to to

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,740
run it needs some some features from

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,040
from yakety basically from the

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,330
development version of you 12 so for

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,880
example it needs a new ETFs to aprox

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,799
package and it doesn't strictly need it

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:58,000
but it's it's much nicer if it has it

00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:00,460
available so for for for the snap we

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,520
actually just again we had a snap craft

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,640
file we told it to use the yakety

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,730
version of the etfs Crocs and just

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,200
bundle our

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:17,529
our tools into the snap and and on xenia

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,649
now you can have the power of the the

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:24,940
tools from yakety without you know any

00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:29,399
risk of regression on your regular

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,440
system so that's that's really nice and

00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:39,519
but what I also find is our founders

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:41,230
that I'm really excited about the the

00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,649
work towards desktop desktop

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,409
applications like I'm a big fan of KDE

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:49,840
and life I use it for video editing and

00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:54,369
you know right and just kind of making

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,740
small videos and fun stuff but the the

00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:00,460
idea of getting the latest and greatest

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,100
KDE and live from KDE directly instead

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,320
of you know waiting for it for the

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,919
latest version to appear in a PPA or

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,830
similar that's just super exciting and I

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,710
can't yeah I can't wait for it I mean I

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:17,409
crater is is available now which is nice

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:21,820
but for me personally like KDE in life

00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:23,710
that would be a killer yeah but I don't

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,570
know maybe maybe it's not just for me

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,149
what would you use what do you guys use

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:33,190
snaps bomb I think one thing to mention

00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:39,580
here is that then there's a kidney and

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:41,440
like um snapping progress and and so

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,659
this might be actually coming and coming

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:50,110
very very soon I mean I myself i'm

00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:51,519
actually quoting jorge castro here we

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,619
used to work for the community and now

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,110
it's working on the cloud and service

00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:59,230
it's very exciting to see that every day

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,940
or every morning you do is up I mean you

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,929
look for new snaps and you find

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:09,789
something new I personally one dry and I

00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:12,850
uses the Aten snap and the code a car

00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:15,700
from me probably tub and that's one that

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,330
I've been enjoying some oil ones that

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,350
I've been playing with

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:25,010
which I find quite useful are the some

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:28,780
of the karups I used to have corazon

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:32,330
NPPA and then test them on unity 8 and

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:35,420
for some of them I start splitting some

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:38,540
some stats to n calculate sorry clockin

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:42,230
calculator and that's a really easy way

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,490
to to ship updates to to users perhaps

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,980
there's not that much difference with

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,690
with clock and calculator because they

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,310
used to come from the clip from the cliq

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,510
store but now they've evolved from the

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:57,050
from that from click to to snap and you

00:24:53,510 --> 00:25:01,630
can still c d or you can still as a user

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:04,010
if the metal it is very very quickly but

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,160
yeah I mean essentially that that's for

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:12,560
me personally as a as a user may need to

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:17,480
mean the main benefit all right we

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,310
should say as well that a secure dress

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,980
off from the snappy timmy mentioned on

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,530
IRC that or confirmed on IRC that the

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,240
mere interface works and pointed to some

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,780
documentation on developer at wanted to

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,050
come I want retail all long URL but if

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:36,530
you are an IRA c2 and to check it out

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,820
then Gustavo niemeyer who Michael was

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,910
mentioning earlier and also from the

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:44,960
snappy team I was talking about some

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:47,930
some service of some some snaps nope

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:52,100
spread telegram moment v krumin MPX

00:25:47,930 --> 00:26:00,880
spotify make MV there you go so long

00:25:52,100 --> 00:26:05,630
list already already um so next question

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,340
from coo coo coo again when will not

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,870
work on the phone and how will the phone

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,300
update images sorrel images relief when

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,960
we load the snaps when will not work on

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:25,010
the phone and how will the phone update

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:28,220
images as planes nerves i believe this

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,870
still work on going on determining that

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,690
some nature will be able to do if you

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:36,270
like a definitive answer but I don't

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,510
know Michael perhaps you know you know

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,010
more about what's going on unfortunately

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,200
not I mean people are working on it

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,270
that's really all I know and and there's

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,240
a lot of there's a lot of activity going

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:51,840
on but I have no idea about timelines

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,400
and details like how far this business

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,050
and but I expect we will in about four

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,840
weeks you will be able no more because

00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,360
we have a we have a meeting where the

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,550
phone people in fishnet people basically

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,060
I get together and we talked about this

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:12,410
in turn but yeah right now sorry I can't

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:17,730
really say anything that's its it's not

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:21,180
you know totally made up I think I think

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,710
people appreciate it I mean I would say

00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,300
though that perhaps one thing that they

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:29,970
should look forward to seeing the seeing

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,050
the progress from the conversion side of

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:36,180
things where we're working on what we

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:42,080
call the personal or the interpersonal

00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:45,840
image or by you will get to repudiate

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,600
delivered us snaps and from that angle I

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,010
think that where we will see most

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:58,860
progress on on getting all snap systems

00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:04,650
for for devices and desktop it's a

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:07,050
simple metaprogramming right your films

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,660
last words haha yeah definitely

00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,250
definitely there's we just need one more

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:17,630
level of indirection to solve this

00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:20,430
problem right working on it are like it

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:28,170
next question can you make a snap from

00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:30,320
the ubuntu sdk i believe i believe the

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,880
sdk teen were looking actually at it

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,810
again myself I cannot answer that one

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,550
but I'm pretty certain that too sdk Tim

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,460
where

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:43,770
trying to do that yeah I definitely talk

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,530
to the SDK team about it a couple of

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,720
weeks ago days ago but i'm not sure what

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,200
the status is like how far it is but

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,500
it's again it's definitely progressing

00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:00,090
and and on the agenda the thing that is

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:03,870
that again it was last words but it

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,850
should be very hard because like if you

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,220
have a template and you know that for

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,470
example most of the steps are going to

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,940
use see Meg from building anyway and

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:18,420
they all need the same dependencies that

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:23,280
should be easy to do for four step craft

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:27,360
right yeah yeah exactly and at a very

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:31,560
high level um clicks tent and snapchat

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,860
have similar designs all right I've just

00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,560
realized that I understood the question

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:43,320
incorrectly so I think there's two just

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:46,520
two sides to this question whether you

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,440
can make whether you can create snaps

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,020
while using the y-12 SDK yes I mean I

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,880
sure set the tee SDK team were looking

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:59,790
at it but what ends to this whether it

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,340
was possible to grid or to deliver the

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:04,610
12 as the cake as a snap and I think

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,410
Jessica team are looking at both things

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:10,530
to be honest right now the SDK you can

00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:13,890
install it through a PPA and I think

00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:20,070
this there was some research gone into

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:23,100
making the SDK available as a snap so

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:26,330
yeah I mean both are possible i think i

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,330
think that's that's probably the answer

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,370
okay so next question is how will a

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,620
snaps deal with different architectures

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,750
do we need to make a separate snap for

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:44,040
our architecture or can it be can be

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:46,440
bundled together but that's again that's

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:51,090
a really interesting question and we

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,090
actually support both models so you can

00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,280
have fat what we call fat snaps which

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,400
right maybe we should call them

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:03,390
differently but so you can bundle

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:06,270
multiple binaries in the same snap the

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,510
architecture field in a snap as a list

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:12,390
I'm saying when you can just do whatever

00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,970
you want here but actually I personally

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,620
I would not recommend it I mean it there

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,460
are certain valid use cases where you

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,930
want to do it but snap craft can talk to

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,480
the store now it's it's really easy to

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,450
push stuff to to the store so I

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,720
personally I would recommend creating

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,880
one snapper architecture and launch pad

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,070
can build these snaps for you so if you

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,620
have a snap craft file you can you can

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,950
link your snap crack file in launchpad

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,710
to a to a build and launch which is even

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,810
able to push all the stuff to the store

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,970
for you all your snaps and then you have

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,640
a one snapper architecture basically

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,230
automatically created use built by the

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,070
launchpad build assets it's really

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:59,250
convenient the reason is obvious right I

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,580
mean the reason is a size because

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,080
because snaps bundle dependencies when

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,250
you need to bundle dependencies for your

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,770
architecture so they tend to get big and

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,700
fast but you know there are use cases we

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,700
support those models

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:26,840
alright trying to find the next question

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:29,870
yes again it's not related so why

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:36,559
refresh and not that date while find and

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:45,139
not search I think yeah that's a tricky

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:51,429
one am so so one reason is and I think

00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:55,549
Gustavo said it into channel already and

00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:57,980
update is this this has a bit of history

00:32:55,549 --> 00:33:01,159
as a term and it's also i mean in a lot

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,679
of ways I'm so apt is using update and

00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,860
upgrade and full upgrade and just

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,379
upgrade and it's all of these terms are

00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,899
kind of I mean they're not confusing

00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:13,940
because you know we get used to them but

00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:15,769
what like why what's the difference

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,990
between an updating and upgrade its kind

00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:24,559
of the words are so similar its yeah

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:27,470
it's it just it just makes sense I think

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,899
to coin a new term and refreshes it is a

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,090
nice time because if you know it really

00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:34,580
conveys what what is happening the

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:40,129
system is is refreshed its there's fresh

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:42,200
stuff coming and and also like one apt

00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:43,850
there's a separation between an update

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,789
engine upgrades like you update the

00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:53,200
metadata and you upgrade your packages

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:57,799
but snap snap d is the metadata is is

00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:02,240
really not a separate step it's when you

00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:05,929
talk to restore it it talks it talks

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,980
metadata at this stage already so there

00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:13,839
is only a single a single interaction

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,839
basically and that's that's refreshing

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,319
I'm wanting to up to 200 to Michael's

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,300
answer as well Gustavo niemeyer is

00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:24,929
actually some members from the from the

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,119
slap-a- tomorrow

00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:30,839
answering questions on on IRC as well

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,309
and it just wanted to to reload that

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,780
this quote from chrome new style for

00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:37,290
those of you who are joining us on

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,339
YouTube on update vs. refresh snaps are

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,470
much more of it lightweight and

00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:43,169
predictable on on updates and they

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,730
update automatically by default is

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,139
different from the typical apt update

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,879
process and we wanted to prevent that

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,550
process from being within the stood for

00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:54,809
historical reasons so refresh rather

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:56,339
than update yeah and Gustav was making a

00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:58,530
really good point here like snaps are

00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:00,150
updated automatically and we update

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,530
stuff all the time like when there is a

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,349
new version in the store you get the

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,480
update and we can do it because because

00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:09,000
we're we have a rollback story like we

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,099
are really confident that if you're if

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,990
you are unhappy with the new version for

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:17,280
whatever reason you can go back to the

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:19,800
previous version and you can also switch

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,480
channels easily like it's it's really

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,329
nice to go back and forth between

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:30,180
versions in in a snobby system and and

00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:33,150
again as much as I as I as I love apt

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:37,799
and empty package and and and as much as

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:40,470
I think we you know we we out our great

00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:42,960
success to it downgrades for example

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,760
we're never really possible I mean you

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,480
could you could do hackish stuff but

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,309
down downgrading in general is

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,490
unsupported boys yea maybe not

00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:56,700
unsupported but the postings would have

00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:00,630
to would have to know about it and it's

00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:07,319
really a it's really something that

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:09,150
nobody tests for so so an upgrade in in

00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:11,609
in the traditional world it's really a

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,710
one-way a one-way trip like you upgrade

00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:17,640
and that's it and if you are unhappy

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:21,750
basically uniquely you use it use a

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:25,140
backup but in this snappy world an

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,880
upgrade is your refresh is you can

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,920
always go back if you're unhappy if it's

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,660
not it's not quite right it's the same

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,240
for channels like you can even switch to

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,480
beta but into to etch and and you know

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,069
if stuff is not working it's crashing

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,670
you just go back to stable or whatever

00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:45,240
whatever

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:47,940
previous version was alright another

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,370
question from Andrew Hyson if you are

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,500
grating up that just depends on cute or

00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,080
decay and you don't care about this

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,620
place server are you expected to include

00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:01,500
all of the plugs for X near and wayland

00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:04,680
in your snack craft or are you expected

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,870
to choose one of them and then will this

00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,710
place overrun inside with the user is

00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:22,260
using EG mirror next or mirren wingler

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:23,880
etc let the little good one this is a

00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,250
difficult one for me because I'm not

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,070
really a a next person or on your person

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:37,740
so am I'm not really sure what the best

00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:40,680
answer is here I I don't think I think I

00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:44,340
mean again take my my answer with a

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,660
pinch of salt because I mean Michael and

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,480
the other guys are the experts in here

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,390
but in my experience particularly on

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,670
snacking applications for the snobby

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,560
playpen project we've been looking at

00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,250
creating what we call to disturb

00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,710
launchers which were parts that put all

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:06,720
of the defense's dependencies that you

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:13,550
need it for running and up under a

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:17,130
particular of for running desktop snaps

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:23,850
and they're under particular to talk in

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:25,880
GTA or are cute in that case I think we

00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:30,750
mostly focused on unity seven

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:37,380
applications so we used the unity seven

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:40,710
blocks only that is within within do

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:45,000
anything mere specific however we

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:46,650
started working on the clock up to be

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,820
runnin up under leaving the sound and

00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,200
unity eight and if i'm not mistaken to

00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,660
get them to work on both

00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:01,380
on both systems you have to then specify

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:04,200
the blocks and dependencies for for

00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,920
unity seven and unity eight although I

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:11,339
don't think we have a unity black per se

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,200
yet but I think to enter the quote to

00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,940
answer the question and some member of

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,900
the author's now getting more correct me

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,210
if I'm wrong you don't have to include

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,320
to include author or all of the plugs

00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:27,329
specifically yeah please you have to

00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,990
keep in mind that a lot of this is

00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:33,060
evolving I'm especially on on the

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,940
desktop and end on this you would you

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,450
back ends like mirin and waylon because

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,280
in all of this is relatively new it is I

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,950
mean there are some you know some words

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,980
some issues some some some rough edges

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:51,210
still and we are very key to to fix

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:54,420
these but I did it takes a little bit of

00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,520
time yeah was just about to say

00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,569
something similar offering a third

00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,670
answer to the question like this is the

00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,920
is the brave new world like we're

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:09,780
dealing with software today which has

00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:13,109
like 20 years of expectations and crazy

00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,569
stuff that just works because it you

00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:18,000
know it evolved that way and now we're

00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:23,760
basically turning everything around but

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:27,060
and things are evolving but like in an

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,890
ideal world app developers shouldn't

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:31,710
really care about this like they should

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,930
write the app and whatever the system is

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:38,720
using to display something it would just

00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:41,369
work how are going to get there no idea

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,680
but yeah but the discussions which are

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:48,660
going to Chapman there in the very near

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,270
future yeah yeah and that I mean always

00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,880
women by right if the system like if a

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,520
snappy system or if the snaps if that

00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,250
looks unfamiliar to you try to remember

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,670
when somebody explains the first time

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:05,339
the separation between user bar and the

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,390
finer points about this I mean I don't

00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,309
think it wasn't

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,140
intuitive back when you heard about it

00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:12,150
for the first time like after 10 years

00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:16,039
of doing it this way sure it's it's

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:19,470
second nature that but really you know

00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:22,109
it's not bad and this is the same it is

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,819
that it's the same phone snaps like it's

00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:29,549
a new concept so it takes a little bit

00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:32,430
to get used to all right so remember if

00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:34,400
you if you have any questions to prepend

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:38,819
them with the world questions so that we

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,589
can see them more easily it seems that

00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:43,220
we've gone through all the patients that

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,390
we had so far but I don't have one for

00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:50,130
Michael taking the opportunity that is

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:54,359
here with us today so for the for the

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:56,670
snappy roadmap snaps you're not just

00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:02,220
quite a lot of pros this quite a lot of

00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:04,500
changes going going on and I'm not to

00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,380
talk of timelines other in particular my

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,329
son is difficult sometimes but

00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:12,059
regardless of timelines Woods would are

00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:17,730
with the the future of snaps that you're

00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:20,250
most looking forward to and sorry what's

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,069
the picture but just naps and must look

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,440
forward to or what oh sorry which was a

00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:29,190
feature in snappy that you are not

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,980
looking forward to AH data updates

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:37,049
actually and so I mean I'm a user of I

00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,720
like i said before like I'm a user i'm a

00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:42,390
developer i'm an upstream so so you know

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,900
it if people aren't happy about certain

00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,460
aspects of of snappy or snippy probably

00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,880
i'm as well right because i'm using it

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,829
daily maybe even more than you and one

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,200
of the things that kind of bottom years

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:58,170
that snaps because they want to

00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,960
dependencies they tend to be bigger than

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,269
devs right and and there's there are

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,160
good reasons for it but but it's a

00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:08,490
trade-off right and like life is always

00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,220
a trade-off and we made this trade-off

00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:13,950
to bundle dependencies but of course

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:17,730
think the cost is now that we have this

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:19,530
additional download but at least part of

00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,180
this will get

00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:25,329
get-get much smaller once we have data

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,130
updates and there is those work on this

00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:30,670
and I really look forward to this

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:35,619
feature and it's also it's also really

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:39,369
nice because the way we reuse like you

00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:41,500
know snaps are self-contained files in a

00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:46,089
predictable former inner inner yellow

00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:50,049
squash FS file so building Delta's is

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:53,589
actually quite easy and if you if you

00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:55,480
look at what what other systems are

00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,250
doing in order to create Delta's or

00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,109
maintain the others like if you if you

00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,059
want to do this on traditional package

00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:03,280
management swear you have a container

00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:05,470
that is unpacked like I p.m. our debt

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,420
you would always have to either keep the

00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,809
container amount or we pack the

00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,309
container get the Delta I mean you know

00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:18,460
sure sure there are different ways of

00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:21,960
doing it but to summarize like snaps are

00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:25,599
really really nice when it comes to

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,549
delta's because they just scream towards

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,940
like make Delta's out of me because it's

00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:33,220
such an easy such an easy way of you

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,530
know of applying them and you always

00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,960
have the original file around like it's

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:42,329
yeah this is this is what I'm looking

00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,329
forward to mostly the most

00:44:44,859 --> 00:45:01,089
excellent thank you all right um so I

00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:04,660
think oh go ahead now I think I think we

00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:07,559
could with good enough questions for for

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:12,099
today so we might consider wrapping up

00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:15,819
early this week otherwise we can still

00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:17,619
bombard them Michael wigs questions

00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:20,799
because they want to know more forward

00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:26,279
smash myself as someone who's using them

00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:26,279
and trying to make them to do something

00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:30,999
but yeah Daniel do you have any other

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,539
questions or do you think we should just

00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:37,210
wrap it up for today and considering

00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:39,279
that i talked to to Michael regularly on

00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:43,809
the phone anyway and you get on my

00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:48,759
liquid question of the time I probably

00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:52,749
want me to keep you here nexon all right

00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:55,150
then I'll probably just like to say Stan

00:45:52,749 --> 00:46:01,690
thank you again Michael for joining us

00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:04,989
today thanks a lot for for the well

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,119

spending time to talk to help you I mean

00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:21,609
you saw it from the from the number of

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,440
questions so with this also reminder to

00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:26,829
everyone who wants to know more about

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:32,650
snaps we've got snappy channel on

00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:34,660
freenode on IRC we have now crafted I

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:37,420
own the website where you can learn all

00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,009
about snaps and learn about getting

00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,279
started with creating your first maps

00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:44,319
and also we've got a couple of other

00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:48,130
initiatives going on so just there's not

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:50,920
a playpen where every tuesday and during

00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,280
the whole day we start snapping

00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,860
applications making sure that we

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,870
everyone wants to create their first

00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,120
snaps and then putting together a list

00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:07,100
of applications that people can use us

00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:09,840
as examples that's on github / 12 /

00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:14,190
snappy dash blatant that's correct

00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,500

00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:19,500

00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,650
people can talk real time with snappy

00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,230
