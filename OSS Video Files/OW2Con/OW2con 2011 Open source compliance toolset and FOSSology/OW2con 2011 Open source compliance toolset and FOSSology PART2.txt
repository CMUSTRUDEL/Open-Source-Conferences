Description: 
	Speaker: Bruno Cornec, HP and Alexandre Lefebvre, OW2
Abstract: FOSSology (http://fossology.org ) is an open source compliance toolset that provides software license and copyright discovery. Every file submitted to the FOSSology system is saved in a file repository, scanned, and results are stored in a database.  
A web user interface displays results while the database and file repository remain for future scans and data mining.
The presentation will cover the major features of the tool, the latest news of the 1.4.1 version, feedback from OW2 FOSSology usage, as well as the roadmap for the coming 2.0 version.
