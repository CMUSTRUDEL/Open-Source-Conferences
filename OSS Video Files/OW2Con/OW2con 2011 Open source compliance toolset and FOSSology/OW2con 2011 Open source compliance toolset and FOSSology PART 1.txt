Title: OW2con 2011 Open source compliance toolset and FOSSology PART 1
Publication date: 2012-01-11
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Open source compliance toolset and FOSSology
Description: 
	Speaker: Bruno Cornec, HP and Alexandre Lefebvre, OW2
Abstract: FOSSology (http://fossology.org ) is an open source compliance toolset that provides software license and copyright discovery. Every file submitted to the FOSSology system is saved in a file repository, scanned, and results are stored in a database.  
A web user interface displays results while the database and file repository remain for future scans and data mining.
The presentation will cover the major features of the tool, the latest news of the 1.4.1 version, feedback from OW2 FOSSology usage, as well as the roadmap for the coming 2.0 version.

	00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:11,150
hello everybody so my name is boon

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,150
Okanagan working for H key as the

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,119
improvising Guatemalan friends and we

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,070
are working for our customers to propose

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,680
an solutions so on my side balaam open

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,900
source components I'm here because I'm

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:35,250
part of the fossil virgin project around

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:41,399
the packaging of Pathology and i know i

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,930
also development project and the

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,090
pathology team when there is an either

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,820
with many we need to translate french so

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,039
what is for sala G so G comes from a

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,670
very ancient Greek word order which is

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,550
fast and logos you know the verse means

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:03,510
science so the study of science around

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,400
free and open-source software how it has

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,630
been defined and there are many many

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,420
goals to the project the goal is to

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,400
create a set of tools and a framework in

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,020
which you will be able to extend the set

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,740
of tools that are provided by deformed

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,780
and go is to identify all the licenses

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,759
which are present inside the software

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,210
I'm not relying only on lots of projects

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,850
or mentioning on the website or inside

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,650
the communication but also looking at

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,420
every source code every piece of

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,840
software which is in silent project

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,759
finding all the occurrences of

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,659
references easel to licenses or to

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,420
copyright sentences and reporting a

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,670
little stuff into a single interface so

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,880
that user can really decide what all the

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,210
licenses really use inside a project so

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,189
this is a analyzes framework and it

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,079
works by scanning up and so software

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,280
with analyzes of code it says the

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,350
results in the database so you can also

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,700
if you want to create additional reports

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,860
for your own exportation of the data and

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,300
the reports are also gifs um we've also

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,980
generated through web interface

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,950
everything is managed through web

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,740
interface and I would have some

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,080
screenshots in order to help you

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:25,730
understand how it's working so fossil

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,709
adji is a part of the Linux Foundation

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,230
initiative around open-source compliance

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,330
there are multiple activities one is

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,820
first bazzara among hospitality of CS

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,320
boutiques interchange format and

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,750
pathology one of the tool which is

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:46,920
promoted as part of the of the Linux

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,010
Foundation compliance program so what

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,800
are we trying to do with the to do this

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,030
aimed to solve some governance running

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,220
around free and open source software

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,560
such as license management cut

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,480
plagiarism and whenever ability tracking

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,630
knowing that what has been really done

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,090
up to now is license management the

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,739
others are possible through the fact

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,690
that you can add agents to for

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,900
scholarship at the moment yet inside the

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,810
project and what I will talk about the

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:20,489
future plans around 2.0 there may be a

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,620
time so after the first quarter of 2012

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,100
where we can see some improvements

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,920
around those two additional topics here

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,720
so how does it work it's as I said it's

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,760
can every single find into delivery

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,970
software you can get at a farm in a

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:45,110
package under your distribution whatever

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,030
it could be an ISO image of the set of

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,130
software everything is taken in account

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,650
and as an entry and it would be also

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,829
Windows conference files or the images

00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,269
and it passes all the files input to

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:03,030
find references to licenses we have the

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,260
database of existing licenses more than

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,830
400 new licenses

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,270
and you can also add your own licenses

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,040
to subdue if you want so if you have

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,080
proprietary license in so if you have

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,850
put in own open-source licenses if you

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,610
would like to add to the tool that it

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:22,660
can detect them and report correctly the

00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:24,460
information you can also add that it

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,160
also detects something which it will be

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,630
an unknown license and the the tool

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,110
which is used to do that it's called

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,810
Namas and has been GPL after the main

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,420
core of pathologies but it was set to in

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,440
fact in the release of pathology and

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,600
this is a tool which has been used

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,690
inside HP for the last ten years in

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,400
order to help us ensure the compliance

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,520
program that we have internally for our

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,460
own developments we use a lot of free

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,080
software inside our own products and in

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,490
order to be in compliance with the

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,410
licenses when we distribute those

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,420
products to the outside we wanted to

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,610
have a very clear analyzes of what we

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,470
were delivering and if we were in

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,480
compliance with the license or not so we

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,760
have to develop all those to set up for

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,410
solji's what we see now has been has

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,090
been in infancy for for the last 10

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:16,870
years in silage I mean a production tool

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:20,110
for you to use so the process flow is

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,870
quite simple you submit your software

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,990
for analysis you wait to read analyzes

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,760
and you get the results so the first is

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,950
you have to submit the software into the

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,180
batch queue so there is a queuing system

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,820
inside pathology ya interface you can

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,669
input here link choose the piece of

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,590
software you want analyze some options

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:46,360
that you can add to browse through and

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,760
you can see it with such a number of

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,710
tasks that will be performed on the

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,070
software and you can imagine here that

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,520
as we extend the number of agents that

00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:00,220
are able to do an action on the software

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,600
which is pass we can have more contents

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,340
here you are--some 0 or binary analyzes

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,050
which is not done for example right so

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,540
you happens on the number of here of

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,180
possibilities and the major one most

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,040
customers and users are interested in in

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,640
is line

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,230
activity so detecting license then you

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,910
have to wait for an analysis you

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,770
submitted it in the queue and there is a

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,920
queue management so you can query the

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,780
queue you can see where your job is in

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,240
which stages it is where has been

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,250
analyzed up to now so it tries for

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,890
responsible W get the software from the

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:40,050
website in reference and then it goes

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,790
into a gentle dance and then it runs a

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,640
certain number of classes analyze it so

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,770
you have the possibility to look at the

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,390
queue and that's quite convenient

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,390
especially if you imagine that you can

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,100
put a full distribution inside the food

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,920
and that's typically what we are doing

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,120
internally so we generally always pass

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,360
every new federal every new BPM

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:10,230
distribution completely so we push

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:15,540
20,000 package know where we are because

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:18,530
it can take days and then at the end you

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,090
can see the results of the analyzes so

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,730
you push this back piece of software and

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,100
you get that list of licenses you know

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:29,790
which number of files have been found

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,070
matching these licenses and each time

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,900
this is a best guess that the tool is

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:43,940
trying to do because of course there is

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:47,280
no code but in any way it's it's a legal

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,590
person putting a stamp on a bedroom so

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,740
you you have to have that two legal

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,150
departments for them to analyze and

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,100
typically what is interesting for them

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,340
is to look at could there be some

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,530
incompatibilities between some licenses

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,510
could there be some lists some licenses

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,430
listed here which are not part of the

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,890
approved list that you have internally

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,720
and you say okay that licenses is by

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,790
licensed for me other voltages to use

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,190
software which is using that license etc

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,260
is a try and you can click on these of

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,350
the license to see all the files or you

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,530
can seek two subdirectories a number of

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,260
licenses which are in fact

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:31,460
by all the components below that

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:34,460
subdirectory so close to to my to my

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,849
colleague Bob Dubay who is using this

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,710
picture to say okay in the past how was

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,979
problem our problems solved between

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,710
people it was through law and today we

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,180
have much more nice ways of dealing with

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,360
problems between people between

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,840
companies which is trial you can go to

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,580
code and you can replace all the

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,980
problems that people are saying instead

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,380
of making a war between two people we

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,860
can just look at the web and you see a

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,390
lot of references around problems that

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,900
have been detected in licenses in the

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,330
past

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,450
and for us it was very important we

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,640
don't want to be in that list of people

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,000
appearing on websites saying HP has some

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,000
bad stuff

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,840
we won't protect ourselves from

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,839
appearing here inside the inside this

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:31,630
type of list of bad users of public

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,950
schools so there is a so there is a

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,610
photo release hosted by the Linux

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,770
Foundation yes it's a sub-project as

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,960
every project hosted by the Linux

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:47,030
Foundation it has recently and the

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,300
website was not available anymore

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,700
and pathology was no exception

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,080
for space are easier SPD's easier so

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,350
although the piece of information were

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,630
just unavailable for a couple of weeks

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,220
we have also worked on the arrogance

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,220
that you reduce it in other two hosts

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,020
then we create for you an account here

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,839
and you will be able to have access to

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,330
the pathology instance in the university

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,410
upload your software and make also tests

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:27,650
around software what we plant it wants

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,210
to make this instance the reported

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,470
pathology that's all is available

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,880
publicly

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:37,070
in in 2008 and we decided to not do it

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,959
because we didn't want that people could

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,899
use for such as a weapon against

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:47,870
offensive software so we prefer that

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:49,160
foreigner come home this instance and we

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,040
know what they are doing with it

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,320
and in general is like security we

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,360
prefer to work before with the project

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
if we identify any problem with run

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,470
license in the project we prefer to work

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,510
with the project up from trying to solve

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,190
the problem with the license and publish

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,899
a new version of the software fixing the

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,199
license exactly as we do on their own

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:11,480
security side so as I said we have had a

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:15,230
certain number of problem with the latex

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:33,829
foundation hosting it has started again

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:36,440
since the back typically yes the

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:48,490
University of so we are migrating some

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:48,490
of the University of random because it

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:08,570
is back again but not everything is here

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,649
we'll take a couple of weeks before we

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,649
