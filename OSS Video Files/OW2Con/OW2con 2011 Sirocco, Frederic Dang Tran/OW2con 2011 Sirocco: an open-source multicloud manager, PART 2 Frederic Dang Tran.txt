Description: 
	Speaker: Frederic Dang Tran, Orange Labs
Abstract: The Sirocco OW2 project was launched in 2011 with the goal of developing a multi-cloud IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) platform. This presentation will describe its architecture, give an overview of its current implementation and of its roadmap for 2012.  The Sirocco middleware exposes a single point of entry to access computing resources located in different IaaS cloud providers either private or public (e.g. Amazon EC2, OpenStack, VMware vCloud Director). In addition Sirocco comes with its own IaaS provider featuring multi-hypervisor support (Xen, KVM, ESX...). The Sirocco platform can be accessed either from a unified Web interface or programmatically through a REST API that hides provider-specific APIs. The Sirocco platform is based on an open framework with a clear separation between generic management logic and pluggable cloud-provider-specific connectors. It is worth noting that part of the Sirocco platform is based on work done in the context of the SelfXL French collaborative project notably with Bull and l'Ecole des Mines de Nantes.
