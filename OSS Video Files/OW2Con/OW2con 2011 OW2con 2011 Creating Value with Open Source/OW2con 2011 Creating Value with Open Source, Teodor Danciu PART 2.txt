	00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:13,620
these are all project that are active in

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,859
today this is a snapshot a screenshot of

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,470
my report you can see the most basic

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,689
elements in a report designer with your

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,240
main design view with the toolbars

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,990
property views outline view and all that

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,730
stuff I have a twin shot missing from

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,769
this presentation it would be a

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,030
screenshot of our newer product

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,790
jaspersoft studio which is eclipse

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,850
plugin i report is a NetBeans plug-in

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,860
and now we're doing this all office all

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:49,800
over again for Eclipse so we're trying

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,680
to cover I was in favor of an eclipse

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,180
move because in Eclipse we have much

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,280
more opportunities to integrate with

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,230
other open-source tools because many

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:05,280
many open source product vendors are

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,170
aren't in the Eclipse world this is a

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,909
screenshot of open reap what you can see

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,930
this is the result of a tabular

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:17,040
reporting on the top you have controls

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,799
for pagination and/or Brander input well

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,509
it's not in this screen but that's what

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:28,400
you can do it openly but you can run

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:32,369
reports in an interactive way well after

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,979
2005 when jaspersoft has been form and

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,680
more resources were put into this open

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,950
source project we basically try to

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,210
extend our reach so we on topped up the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,610
library we have added functionality

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,130
ourselves I mean we came up with what we

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:53,369
call just believe what server so that

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:57,210
again we provide our own solution for

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,640
deploying reports and avoid users having

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,790
to co themselves around around the

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,890
library so some of these features are

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,540
obvious for reporting

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,640
or the I server you have to have a

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,800
surprise your boy story we secure access

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,709
your login with username and password

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,450
and we have scheduling so you can run

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,390
reports in the background and have their

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:22,050
result due by email or stored in the

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,540
repository and we also went beyond

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,730
reporting with beta analysis like all

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,880
app slice and dice and all that kind of

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:36,330
data processing what's important is that

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,459
we try to stay true to this goal of

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,550
making our product flexible and

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,090
extensible so you can take our server

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,310
and change it to you i call it services

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,090
through web services either rest or so

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,610
so you can make it look like your own

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:58,019
product and it's all open source so it

00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,239
where we are basically giving more value

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,709
to our open source stack of course on

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,750
top of our open source like their

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,150
commercial modules but they're not

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,930
mentioned here like the ability to

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,670
create simple reports in a web designer

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,489
environment and all that stuff but if

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,820
you don't need that kind of stuff you're

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,850
the open source server is probably

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,690
fulfilling nine percent of your bi

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,670
reporting and big analysis needs this is

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,890
a screenshot of Jasper report server you

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,590
can see I have the repository I can

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,930
search and look for my reports and I can

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,209
click on them and run them and see the

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,760
results immediately or schedule them and

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,860
have the results and by email at a later

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,560
date in time this blue default skin can

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,750
be changed and it will no longer look

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,459
like just a report server you can look

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,770
like your own application and you can

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,410
integrate with it either

00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:04,480
integration or web services of it can be

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:07,510
customized at a very fine level we saw

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,350
how other contributing to our stack like

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,790
they provide a designer they provided

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,380
servers with the pod stories and all

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,270
that stuff but there's yet another way

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,930
to contribute to an open source project

00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:22,900
and we try to make it more easy for

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,350
others to contribute by opening up our

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,420
API so I said earlier well we just

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,700
reverse you can run a report against any

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,890
kind of data we had to make what we call

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,320
an extension going to just the reports

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,480
to allow others to write their own data

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,470
sources write their own query executors

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:45,010
to provide to be able to provide exotic

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,810
data to our reporting it also because we

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,630
don't know where the report is deployed

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,980
we had to provide an inspection point

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:57,070
for 4am betters to specify how

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,990
hyperlinks are dynamically created to

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,170
point back to some parent application

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,740
all that so we have various extension

00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,910
points all across the API just so that

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,450
users can plug in their stuff it gives a

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,400
tremendous flexibility and gives more

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,230
opportunity to for people to contribute

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,180
we have contributions in the form of

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,850
data sources like Excel data sources

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,940
JSON data sources things that have come

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:28,900
along on the community trackers as

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:32,050
contributions and also an important way

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,690
to contribute is to contribute a special

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,150
content I mean just raipur started with

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,470
these report templates in which you can

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,200
put but text fields charts images may be

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,300
some sort of table like structures but

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,310
what if I want some flash chart but if I

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,419
want a new type of Dart but what if i

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,820
want maps so we created an API which we

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:59,130
call the custom impunity

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,780
and let users implement their own custom

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,370
components I mean there's a bar chart

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,740
that we don't support you have to

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,350
implement an interface and you can embed

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:13,920
very exotic bar codes as we'll see or

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:17,630
comment Paul wats be what's in front of

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,810
us we saw a little bit of history well

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:24,690
as far as reporting is concerned we plan

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,780
to work in the future on interactive

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,920
well just very poor started as a rather

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,590
static report generating you generate

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,520
pdfs or printing or it sells and all

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,870
that stuff but nowadays users want more

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,150
and more to interact with the reports

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,580
what if i want to sort a table what if i

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,330
want to change columns what if i want to

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:51,090
drill into or filter or play with that

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,610
table that was prepared for me and I

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,620
don't like how it looks so I want to

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,260
change it all this kind of interactivity

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,480
is something we're going to work I mean

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:05,100
we started to work on and it's going to

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:08,610
keep us busy for four months now we also

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:13,440
made a move into mobile we have an open

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,560
source rest api and we have a project on

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,660
our Forge in which we exemplify how to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
use this API is to create application

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,780
for mobile devices so we have an iphone

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,880
sample application and what we can see

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,800
in this screen is the content of the

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,260
just for reportserver repository i can

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,030
browse the report boy story people

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,820
reported i want to see and i see it in

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,580
PDF or HTML format i can change

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,460
parameters and running so i can take the

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,770
reports we need wherever I go and we

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:49,170
think this is important more and more in

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:53,310
the future of course our server side

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:56,880
solution was created in a way that any

00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:01,430
enables it to be delivered as a service

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:04,190
so we have a cloudy presentation

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,530
can be tested on our website and we we

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,650
plan to work with more and more clouds

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,590
oilers to provide di for their

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,990
environment also i already mentioned we

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,390
support any kind of beta we do support

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,000
big data nowadays with special

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:24,320
connectors on the most popular Big Data

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,870
engines and they're all available on our

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,620
fortune on our website and we continue

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:38,600
to work on them to make them more better

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:40,640
and more visible well not sure how much

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,660
time i have but i just wanted to say

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
that when i started this and usually

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,620
when you work on a project you don't

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
work on something something that you use

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,480
yourself I mean you you work for a

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,390
client the client cells that solution to

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,350
some other client and that song but

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,420
sometimes it's happened that these

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,520
products you're working on come back to

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,860
you and you're becoming a user yourself

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,770
and that happened to me earlier this

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,560
year and I sent an email in the company

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,600
saying well now I'm a user myself

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,270
because banca commerciale alumina which

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,850
is the biggest romanian bank with part

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,030
of the heirs to group and i'm a customer

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,830
this bank has this online service to

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,020
check your account to make transaction

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,580
online so a few months ago they

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,680
introduced a new menu in their

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,690
application saying generate your

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,520
statements or transaction statements and

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,410
when i right click on the PDF it said

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,300
generated by just freak or so I'm now a

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:43,130
user of our own technology and that came

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,180
rather as a surprise because we didn't

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:50,690
know what they what they do it with our

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,300
product they later became customers but

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,400
they have implemented

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,810
before becoming comes customers because

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,780
basically they took the open source

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:01,420
product we can see here I report in

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,540
which they design their statement

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,320
document with account balance or I don't

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,410
know how do you call that in English and

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,840
this is what I receive every time I want

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,140
to check my my transactions it's a PDF

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,070
and what's interesting in their

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,920
limitation because they generate about

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:27,490
25,000 documents like this per month and

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,780
there's a risk of their server being

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:34,390
let's say hit by many requests like that

00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,340
they let you generate the report in the

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,320
background so the results you will get

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,590
it later on when it's ready for you and

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,700
I think that I found that's a very good

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,860
way to integrate reporting this kind of

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,410
reporting because you don't have to wait

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:57,120
on line or the results to come back to

00:10:50,410 --> 00:11:01,750
you another interesting use case is the

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,760
essence here well I already seated I

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,260
printed myself such ticket but I didn't

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
know it's raining we just buried words

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,180
and we only found out when a colleague

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,720
also looked into the PDF and saw

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,780
generated by its great port so since a

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:22,690
is using also the open source solution

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:24,490
they purchased from us support three

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,950
what we call the fringe then stack

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,720
support so if they are allowed to call

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,080
us three times they had roamed as they

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,690
never call them so it's working for them

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,960
currently they generate about 60,000

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,970
tickets like this third day and in this

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,120
edition what's interesting is the

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,420
barcode it's it's not the type that we

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,880
support so they use our interfaces to

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,880
