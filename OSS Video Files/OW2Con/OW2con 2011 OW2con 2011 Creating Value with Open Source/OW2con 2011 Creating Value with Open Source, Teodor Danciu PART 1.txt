welcome to this session about how to add

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:18,539
value to open stores i'm going to try

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,420
explain how we managed to add some value

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,560
in the open source especially when it

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,820
comes to reporting and bi open source VI

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,969
and i will talk about just reports and

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:36,660
see what when well with during just

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,020
reports evolution what went not very

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,410
well and how this experience that we

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,520
gather in 10 years like help you in your

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,710
open source and ever i'm going to

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,660
present little history of open source

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,320
again it's going to be about

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,539
jasperreports and while doing so I'm

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,430
trying to show how we were able to

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,250
continue to open source how other

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:08,850
contributed to our products and in the

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:14,670
end I'm going to just take a quick look

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:17,460
at to use case studies that are dear to

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,100
my heart because I just came across that

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,259
brother accidentally I will start by

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,360
presenting a liquid context of open

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,130
source reporting about 10 years ago when

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,040
I started just they just for your

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,960
project so at the time I needed to do

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,540
some reporting in some project that I

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,700
was involved with and basically I looked

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,970
around to see what's there in open

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,479
source and what tools i could use and

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,550
this is what I found so at the time in

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:53,490
2000-2001 we had attaching at all

00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:58,290
which is I listed them here of very good

00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,210
so we had told from Apache foundation to

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,790
generate PDF basically which later

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,720
evolved to support out formats we had

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,760
also library which was part of the

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,620
jakarta project at the time for generic

00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,110
in Excel files of course many people

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,760
were creating their own leap or choosing

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:23,940
templating engine is like velocity and

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,810
there are also some true reporting tools

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,750
at a time like data vision which is just

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,150
just like just report them reporting

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,190
tool in the classic speak of reporting

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,720
with templates and you feel beta into

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,420
them and all that stuff and even had a

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,670
designer but when I looked around I said

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,300
well it's probably not complete left

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,910
let's see with if we can do better we

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,170
had a very good PDF charity library

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:55,410
which is still very very useful today I

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,250
text by panola again also ours we had

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,930
charts in Java with the best charting

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,370
library that there is an open source

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,310
java which is the chief which are

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,980
validated builder and also david at the

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,090
time started a reporting engine called a

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,810
free report who which then he later gave

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:21,209
control to thomas mortar and the project

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:24,690
is in the open source today as well and

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,880
of course if you didn't want to go with

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,400
any of those you could always reporters

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,580
with Chase is on your own so that that

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,739
was the context so I said well given the

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,720
experience I had with some reporting

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,170
engines from from other platform I said

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,110
well let me see if I can put something

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,560
together and how long did that take so

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,110
what was the approach taken well is

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,630
there any way to add value to existing

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,700
open source stack I mean what is missing

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,540
that that was the first thing I had I

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,840
had to

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,629
to observe or identify and I think it

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,180
was a rather a niche a good opportunity

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:08,069
because there was really missing a

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,859
powerful reporting tool in the Java

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,859
world we had those tools that each were

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,709
doing something but they didn't work

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:20,519
together very well and say so I started

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:24,630
to write down some requirements and yeah

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:28,440
I think this is the best approach at

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,130
least that worked for me and was that I

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,500
started to write things on baked or just

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,479
write down requirements and then think

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,430
about it how what are the technical

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,259
challenges ahead how do you solve

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,770
different rendering problems how do you

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,389
generate different platform at so well

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,310
what what what is your file format if

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,560
you want to put together templates and

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,449
what is this definition so basically I

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,759
thought about design and architecture

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,389
without coding anything for about a

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,909
month or two and then well I pretty much

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,570
had everything figured out I started to

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:07,940
dropped some code and I think what

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,130
helped the project start up was that I

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,199
just published that proof of concept

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:18,690
immediately on sourceforge source port

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,659
was a very popular environment for open

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,560
source people to meet up and it still is

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:27,720
today so it was a great choice there

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,300
were other products in the projects that

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,520
took a different approach they said well

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,740
maybe we should charge something like

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,580
think your hundred dollars for our

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,800
solution and in this way have immediate

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,940
revenue and

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,009
see how it goes in my mind I I thought

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,940
well there's no point in charging

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:53,599
anything that because the the goal is to

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,789
have as many peoples as I can using this

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,190
stuff and see if it's good for anything

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:03,740
so for me the choice of going officers

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:06,949
was rather obvious and I basically came

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,949
up with with this reporting library that

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:13,729
filled the gap that I I sense was there

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:17,750
in open source recording or the Java

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:20,210
platform and this library is basically

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,789
as I said a reporting engine in the

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,680
classical sense that you have reports

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,650
sections and you fill it with data and

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,699
you produce a document that you can then

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,190
export what a format so it's it's like

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:37,669
templating engine in itself but it had

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,490
some rather powerful capabilities that

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:44,990
are still true today like it's able to

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,639
produce very complex outputs it's a

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,120
course offering source java based which

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,099
was the meal at first and it's very easy

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,199
to embed into an application basically

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,150
you can take this reporting engine input

00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,789
into a java desktop application a web

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:04,130
application anything that it's using

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,500
java basically and it can be leveraged

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,779
from non job applications with

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,229
integration through through other

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:15,289
protocols like total see you later web

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:20,680
services another so the important thing

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:24,289
was that it's embed ability

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,349
characteristic enabling to to be runtime

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,240
agnostic so if we just receive any kind

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,490
of data that is available in a parent

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,259
application and deliver the output we

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,569
don't know what is going to happen with

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,240
this output so we can concentrate on the

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,659
very on the most important features of

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,419
our engine so in the end the idea was to

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,169
produce a powerful engine that can

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,060
produce basically a document out

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:52,060
any kind of data that can be embedded

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,840
into any job application I think we

00:07:52,060 --> 00:08:00,279
achieved in doing that well what helped

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:05,620
the project grow rather fast in in the

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:08,710
first few years well it's important to

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,610
work with the community from from day

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,599
one I mean I put here this chart to

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:20,050
indicate the traffic on the forums in

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:21,729
the first few years until 2005 when when

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,150
just for soft came around so basically

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:27,999
an team until early 2005 I was on my own

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:34,930
basically so on this graphic the most

00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:39,880
important thing are the first line here

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:43,570
until the genome 2003 because it shows a

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,209
steady growth in informs traffic what

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,269
made that happen basically I said to

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:53,740
myself the goal of replying to any post

00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:56,860
on the forums so if you do that you're

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,670
basically giving value to to your

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,560
product because even those who come just

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,470
by accident on the forms you they see

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,690
it's active then they're they're more

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,940
encouraged to continue use that product

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,040
and give it give it a chance basically

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,649
and also help you improve it right away

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,579
so that was very important and I think

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:21,610
it's in terms of effort i would say that

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:25,930
involvement with the community and that

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,000
time frame was half 50-50 like you half

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,029
of the available time you just code and

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,519
half of your time you spend grow in your

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,500
community another important aspect is

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,420
incorporate community that well I

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,339
started with a set of requirements that

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,050
i thought are good giving the experience

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,540
I had with other similar tools in the

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,040
past but then after working with the

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,480
community for the first few months I

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,160
realized that the least I put together

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,029
doesn't match what your real users will

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,460
expect for the product so I have a good

00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,800
example for that

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,450
after the five or six months although it

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,250
was not planned for I had to implement

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,860
support for what we call subreports

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,900
because everybody wanted to use that and

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,570
initially I didn't think about it so I

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:14,820
have to switch gears and implement what

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:16,860
they wanted what this is an opposite

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,600
open-source dictum I just put it there a

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,810
release often release early but it's

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,260
very very very true and helpful honey

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,410
you don't have you don't have to acetate

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,140
in in releasing things as soon as you

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,080
put them together because it will help

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,300
you drive project into its natural

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,880
evolution if you wait for two or three

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,600
months working on some feature that then

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:47,280
when you publish nobody uses it's

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:50,250
basically last time and also what

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,030
happened during these years when I work

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,460
alone is that I took any opportunity to

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,410
redesign I mean if I realize at some

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,980
point that introducing some reports that

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,890
say have to I have to go through some

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,100
radical changes in the API I just made

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,220
them with with bigger and bigger teams

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,930
after its it's difficult I mean when

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,160
when projects grow responsibilities

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,080
distributed and you have to have a

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,730
meeting to decide whether they reflect

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,980
or not do we have the resources to do

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,700
that or not so when you're alone it's

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,800
easy and it's it makes the the project

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,720
more healthy but these were good steps

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,290
that were took at the time because they

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,150
ensure stability and the flexibility and

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,580
probability of the engine in the

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,820
following years which are which is still

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,870
true today as just a report started by

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,120
trying to identify what was missing in

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,740
Java open source community this is how

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,460
other projects started after

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,760
jasperreports was becoming more and more

00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:01,560
popular so immediately within the first

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,290
year well even I knew that 44 just

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,149
reports as a recording engineer

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,430
it's really useful unity Haluk designer

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,500
but I have time to work on design

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,660
ourself I have put together a draft but

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,019
I realized that the amount of work to

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:19,670
make a good designer goes far beyond my

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:22,100
my band witnessing but there were others

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,779
who took up the challenge and won the

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,850
best example is the i/o port designer

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,470
developed by giulio Toffoli from Italy

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,250
who started within the first year after

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:35,920
they just were reports launched and then

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:40,759
there were others who rather disappeared

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,920
soon because they realize it's it's it's

00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:46,130
something that demands a lot of

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,959
commitment so only a few of those

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:53,779
projects that started to extend just for

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,480
reports functionality are still in

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,699
existence today because at least for the

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,269
designer I can tell it's a lot of effort

00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:06,550
so Julia totally joined jaspersoft in

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:09,410
2005 as well and I / designer is now the

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,180
one of our flagship product that Jasper

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,670
solids they designer to create templates

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,760
for jasperreports just for assistant is

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,190
rather inactive right now but it's only

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,380
there because it's a good tool and it

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,569
was a good tool at the time filling a

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,870
gap that we had in the increased world

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,670
and nowadays we are trying to fill that

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,310
gap because your system is no longer

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,680
active and we are go we are already

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:39,230
having our own tool in Eclipse College

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,480
extra stops to do other types of open

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,699
source projects that sit on top of

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,160
jasperreports are open reports which

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:48,110
provided a web interface for deploying

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,579
your reports I mean if you wanted to do

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,990
something you just Reaper to have to

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:56,089
wire it in your application for my data

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,699
capture output so you had to write at

00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:01,610
least hundred lines of code let's say so

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:03,079
openly ports filled that gap saying well

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,350
you guys just install this application

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,079
and you deploy your your reports in the

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,939
web environment and all that stuff also

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,350
diamond money just for an open source

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:15,750
project that fulfill

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,820
something that was let's say missing at

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,250
the time jasperreports produces this

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,530
static reports and what if you want to

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:26,070
have some dynamic tables in which you

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,690
can hide gluons or add new clones or do

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,180
some conditional formatting and all that

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,630
stuff so dynamic Jeffords it's an open

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,940
source API that wraps up just four

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,530
reports and offers mechanism to create

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,530
