Description: 
	Speaker: Alban Richard, CEO, UShareSoft
Abstract: This session discusses how ISVs and IT professionals can accelerate their business, making existing software cloud ready or available as a SaaS offering. It will cover cloud software migration challenges and trends as well as how to onboard your software to any cloud or virtualized infrastructure, providing an overview of how and why to build base image templates that are pre-integrated and "ready-to-run". Today most professionnals are building these images manually, which is time consuming and difficult to maintain. New tools such as the UShareSoft's UForge Appliance Factory enables professionals to automate the processes of image creation and maintenance, from any OS to any cloud. UForge enables customers to quickly build custom VMs or self-deployable, multi-tier Elastic Appliances ; easily migrate applications to the cloud; or deliver "build-to-order" OS and cloud server templates. The presentation will include a demo of how to assemble and publish an image template.
