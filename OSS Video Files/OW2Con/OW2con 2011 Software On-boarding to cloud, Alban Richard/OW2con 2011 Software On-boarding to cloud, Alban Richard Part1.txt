Title: OW2con 2011 Software On-boarding to cloud, Alban Richard Part1
Publication date: 2012-01-09
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Software On-boarding to cloud, Alban Richard
Description: 
	Speaker: Alban Richard, CEO, UShareSoft
Abstract: This session discusses how ISVs and IT professionals can accelerate their business, making existing software cloud ready or available as a SaaS offering. It will cover cloud software migration challenges and trends as well as how to onboard your software to any cloud or virtualized infrastructure, providing an overview of how and why to build base image templates that are pre-integrated and "ready-to-run". Today most professionnals are building these images manually, which is time consuming and difficult to maintain. New tools such as the UShareSoft's UForge Appliance Factory enables professionals to automate the processes of image creation and maintenance, from any OS to any cloud. UForge enables customers to quickly build custom VMs or self-deployable, multi-tier Elastic Appliances ; easily migrate applications to the cloud; or deliver "build-to-order" OS and cloud server templates. The presentation will include a demo of how to assemble and publish an image template.

okay so if you you don't know you should

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,679
staff who have been actually working

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,719
already with other view to especially

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,059
with the open source cloud well

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:20,010
initiative would it produce some elastic

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,890
appliances for the for the for the for

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,510
the bi initiative I'm going to do is of

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,010
course I have to do some slides up some

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,210
some demonstration everybody did some

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,949
demonstrations and we'd have to do some

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,810
ministration I will rush into the slide

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,940
but basically if you don't know too much

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,860
you should soft we are we are a company

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,860
focusing exclusively on onboarding

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,239
software to the drought what is what is

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,950
cloud computing very quickly cloud

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,010
computing is about utility computing

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,510
making sure the compute and the storage

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,309
is available under man is something

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,620
which is a must-have today how do you

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,780
make sure you software is a one click

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,399
away to be able to run and one node or

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,079
several nodes this is what we are

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,390
specialized on we were providing an

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,690
online platform a SAS that is helping

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,699
you to assemble your full software in

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,680
images so creating the images

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,570
maintaining the images and being able to

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,760
privileged to any cloud so in minutes in

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,560
minutes you can later that you can take

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,560
your your value in term of software and

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,159
go to any cloud from anyways this is

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,530
real this is real well considered by IDC

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,830
in 2010 as one of the two best platform

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,240
worldwide following that recently in two

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,979
weeks ago we were in santa clara cloud

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,220
expo and will introduce our App Store

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,470
well now and delivering an app store

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,360
exactly like just Apple so while

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,610
bringing the model of the Apple model

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,799
for business to the cloud computing ite

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,740
applications so you will see that after

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,189
actor in the demonstration what I want

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,409
to do is really quickly actually it what

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm trying to the presentation is very

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,000
focused on on on is vs developers and IT

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,470
professionals so the objective of the

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,360
slide here is me to explain it be the

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,329
challengers of one of the challengers to

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,340
bring the new software to the cloud why

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,759
you should do it why you should do it

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,670
and and we'll go very quickly into the

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,930
demonstration so the challengers are are

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,940
mainly the first challenge that you have

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,679
to deal with the full stack you can't

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,239
just provide anymore your software as

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,319
wondrous piece of software you have to

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,150
provide the full stack

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,310
you go to when you go to a cloud

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,749
architecture you have the full image

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,370
that needs to run so you need to have

00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:22,379
the operating system the middle where

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,510
the configurations everything ready to

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,799
go so the matrix of complexity is

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,659
becoming extremely high you have many

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,269
ways many many Middle where many

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,459
hypervisor many cloud actually

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,530
compatible one is brokering too many

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,629
cloud but you still have many upper back

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,310
risers you still have many OS and you

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,590
still have many ways of configuring

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,889
applications a lamp stack linux apache

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,819
mysql PHP you have 47th versions just on

00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,409
just on windows ok so not only the

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,329
configurations part and the different

00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,060
assembly of the different components but

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,879
also the install settings when you

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,489
create an image how do you reset the

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,419
install settings of the keyboard of the

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,949
license because one the first time the

00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,689
user is going to consume your software

00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,919
you want him to click on the license you

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,840
want him to chew this keyboard otherwise

00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,730
you are going to have a as a tea

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,769
keyboard for QRT marketplace or a

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,480
chinese keyboard for a QA team at a

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,980
place so you have to make sure that you

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,930
grow your sufferings becoming very

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,849
professional when you go to cloud by

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,370
resetting network network settings

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:26,939
keyboards license ram storage everything

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,319
and of course post install easy to make

00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,599
just to each weekly application on one

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,509
node and pre configured to do some boot

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,340
script what about multiple node the web

00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,199
app on one node application another one

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,319
and everything configured out of the box

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,239
in one click that's something that is

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,949
more challenging right so we're

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,150
providing while providing tools for

00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,509
being able to provide all these

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,040
assembling and and this is what we are

00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,209
going to seem to demonstrations so why

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,049
you needs to deliver actually your

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,579
software in a in a full staff domain

00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:01,530
domain domain driver is going for you to

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:03,659
expand your business cloud computing I

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,009
think Zimmerman's present mr. Rayner

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,449
Zimmerman's presentation was right on

00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,159
the point I mean you are going to have

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,199
some changes in industry you are going

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,579
to have some people going to win from

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,500
this opportunity of the cloud computing

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,939
some others are going to lose if you

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,919
wants to expand your business going to

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,079
cloud you will have to make sure that

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,150
you can have your software cloud if i

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,740
satisfy so what you can do to the

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,710
equator quite easily use go to amazon

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,570
good an image instantiate and manually

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,520
do all your own

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,590
duration snapshot that's an easy way of

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,270
doing it it's not going to help you to

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,460
go to cloud in an enterprise private

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,680
cloud or on another cloud platform which

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,270
is not amazon it's not going to help you

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,350
for many many kind of configurations

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,260
that you may have in a different

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,310
software so that's the complexity is

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,560
starting to increase when you think

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,630
about all the different options and and

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,780
software that you're providing so the

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,240
key driver here for why doing it is

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,890
money make your software available for

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,010
the clack clickety Clow one click away

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:00,610
from user user to be able to go to

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,110
market place and use yourself actually a

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,810
user surf model is to provide our

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,790
platform for free to developers well

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,210
monitors I'm monetizing our platform to

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,030
cloud providers and large enterprise so

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,400
actually we are engaging worldwide with

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,200
a lot of cloud providers and we are

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,660
starting to build with many many cloud

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,190
providers app store so if you wants to

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,290
be able to be on Marketplace on App

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,390
Store you will have to have your

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,550
software available as a one click away

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:35,120
in an app store like so just one side on

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,220
how you should soft uniqueness in the

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,350
industry is that we model everything and

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,390
why it's important if you snap shut just

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,530
an image and this is everybody's doing

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,600
that right now you go to Amazon it

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,610
snapshots up for health images so

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,800
snapshot is good but but they are

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,330
specific to a given cloud so the images

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,610
on Amazon are specific to amazon cloud

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,230
with Amazon format I am I format but

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,940
also you have some license management

00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,000
which is already click through you have

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,410
some security and compliance risk a

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,840
large launch price is not going to take

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,270
an Amazon stack and just take as is and

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,070
put and put his software on it for one

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,350
good reason that the man was pointing

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,120
this morning governance I wants to make

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,890
sure that I need I understand everything

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,570
that is in the stack all the little

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,310
components of the other stack needs to

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,890
be understood otherwise i'm not going to

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,230
comply be compliant with saban Oxley or

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,080
I power or PCI kind of standard so

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,180
golden image is good for now but moving

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,310
forward in in the in the computing space

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,310
you will have to have more modern tools

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,830
more induced realizations of putting

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,020
your software on the on the on the cloud

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,090
and this is about server templates

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,249
templating being able to have a

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,919
descriptions and a model of all your

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,109
Zack and this is what we do use yourself

00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,669
is specialized and full of providing a

00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:50,569
SAS platform where you can build

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:52,309
templates in minutes so as I said we

00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:55,519
recently introduced the first of the

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:58,099
industry app store Ike server templates

00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,719
factory but a dynamic factory the

00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:02,149
factory is integrating some tools for

00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:04,879
being able to build on the fly in

00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:08,839
minutes from any software your templates

00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,289
share to the to the store clone from the

00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,809
store so you have all these ecosystems

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:16,579
agility huge agility that you can handle

00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,649
great indapur into the platform and of

00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,589
course publish and publish to any kind

00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:24,589
of cloud so we are providing actually in

00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:27,589
this platform 30 OS formats to build on

00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:28,909
and we go to 15 different out output

00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:32,269
formats in term of virtualization and

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:35,989
cloud platform not compatible one yet

00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:38,059
but maybe in the future ok so the build

00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,649
share and publish our area need for bill

00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,599
for building the full stack and having

00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,219
the software governance having the full

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,659
stack complaining sharing is being able

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,459
to really have this aspect of

00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,259
collaborating between users in the

00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,909
enterprise how it works I mean you have

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,279
people developing you even have people

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:54,079
responsible for just us some other

00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,119
people having the middleware on it and

00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,499
being able to have the full stack which

00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,639
is shareable between the different

00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,319
groups between the development groups

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,209
between the quality engineering groups

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,499
and between the production group so

00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:07,579
sharing those kind of templates is

00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:11,110
really interesting for for the life

00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:14,389
cycle and the maintenance and and

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,279
efficiency of the different teams and of

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,549
course being able to in one click going

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,509
to any cloud is something pretty unique

00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:22,039
so if you want to make the software

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,610
available on the clown now you can do it

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,049
I mean you have two options and two

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,849
members of audibly two are working

00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:33,889
together for for the for putting the

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,779
first on the on you on the European

00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,849
market place the first OpenStack public

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,959
cloud has been announced by in advance

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,639
in advance is actually providing the

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,589
public at a secure we are partnering

00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,389
with in advance to provide the factory

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,509
and App Store there is a test of color

00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:52,519
you can you can actually go online and

00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,230
go to the tester programs at intervals

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,000
calm you can also go

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,190
to use your soft online where you can

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,130
have a coma code and get your free full

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:03,860
features account and we'll keep that for

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:07,430
free for all other brilliant members for

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:10,910
full features for the for the father for

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,230
the folder for your software so let me

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,090
go into the demonstration very quickly

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,950
to show you a little bit the platform so

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,660
I i have actually everything is

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,690
virtualized ourselves we are virtualized

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,270
so everything one vm i know this year so

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,670
this is a five years old machine with

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,960
external and just the USB connections

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,110
and you have a three-tier architecture

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,780
in their web service database sir data

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,180
based here and great great great here

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,640
for the full generation of the images so

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,700
right now I'm directly into the into the

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,300
store here and you can see actually a 30

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,400
different kind of images all right

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,490
wordpress constants I will come back to

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,860
that lamp stack movable-type it set

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,860
right Sarah you have a builder tab you

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,690
have three types of there so the app

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,950
store is common to all the organizations

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,690
there is a notion of organizations

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,940
user's privilege it's its search cell

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,340
service multi-tenant this anti-phase

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,350
called you forth builder is something

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,800
you can download to any platform Windows

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,230
Linux it's a rich Internet application

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,270
everything is api-based so our telco

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,180
customers are putting this internet

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:25,100
bottle into the web the web front front

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,900
front front front page cloud console for

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,910
for having the store into the console

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,010
for being able to have the build aspect

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,930
into that console and being able to do

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,640
the generations to directly to their to

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,620
their provisioning to their account to

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,990
the iCloud account so this builder tab

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,150
is giving you the capabilities to build

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,460
very 15 minutes you can see that this is

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,370
my private own library of the user

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,130
account damn it i have three appliances

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,010
three images of cloud already done i

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,110
have also my account tab which is

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,770
actually giving me all the connectors to

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,920
all these clouds vmware vcloud director

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,119
amazon cloud com you can see each other

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,550
 for instance is

00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:08,199
if I click on edit here you can see that

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,749
you have my personal credentials to be

00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,899
able to upload directly the image to to

00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:15,369
the to the to the image library so we're

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,899
working actually with the open source

00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:21,279
community too we are helping actually to

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,110
contributing to the glance module of

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,269
OpenStack so we can upload directly from

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,369
our platform to glance so if you have an

00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,139
OpenStack platform in your in your lab

00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:31,749
you can from the platform directly

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,540
online upload directly into glance right

00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:36,339
for the image library so let me go

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,129
through the Builder very quickly and and

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,459
show you the building and appliance for

00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,459
