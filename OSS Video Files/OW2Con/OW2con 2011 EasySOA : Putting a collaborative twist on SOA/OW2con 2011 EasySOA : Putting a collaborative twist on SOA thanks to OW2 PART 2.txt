Title: OW2con 2011 EasySOA : Putting a collaborative twist on SOA thanks to OW2 PART 2
Publication date: 2012-01-12
Playlist: OW2con 2011 EasySOA : Putting a collaborative twist on SOA
Description: 
	Speakers: Marc Dutoo, OpenWide and Alain Boulze, EasiFab
Abstract: Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Architecture's first goal is enabling business agility - and for that, it's time to put people beyond developers and architects back in the middle of it all. To do that, the EasySOA project (http://www.easysoa.org) builds on top of the OW2 Nuxeo DM collaborative document management platform, and has embedded in it a custom tailored
service bus based on the OW2 FraSCAti heterogeneous service platform. This presentation details the architecture of FraSCAti integration in Nuxeo, thanks to Nuxeo's OSGI-style architecture, and how it allows to automatically discover SCA-defined services, and to lay the foundations of an agility-fostering "SOA sandbox". This integration will be
demonstrated on stage, as well as the innovative features it enables such as online collaborative service discovery.
Further plans will be unveiled and OW2 community feedback will be asked about it, such as unified monitoring API along with OW2 Talend and OW2 Jasmine, or contribution to OW2 Cloud initiative projects such as the sister project Compatible One. Real world user feedback will be provided by EasySOA's Partner Entreprise Program, through end-user designed use cases such as collaborative SOA documentation, auditing an SOA, integrating with Eclipse SOA tools and API change detection.

so that's what variety is within dgs

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,529
work so now that you know it better but

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,400
what it's about let's see what's behind

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,580
it yes way how with right people that

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,210
receive are gonna answer that so all

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,520
partners are areas that are providing

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,850
the homogenous service engine frascati

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:39,899
let's say compatible which is standard

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:43,250
that can describe on nes way a useful is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,829
if up that's a start that's got out from

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,640
in relapse envelope and that's going to

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:55,530
provide work on issue involving we take

00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:02,190
it this way and my dream don't we just

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:05,070
line so good which will provide a safe

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:10,799
direction and monitoring technical and

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:13,010
business in order to jess time and work

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,000
along with our partners on your scales

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:22,439
diptera that's working on a sway and

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,060
direct connections to connect both to

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,710
existing business services but also

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,390
provide

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,390
things wrong I'm wrong

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,570
connection to a testing data just again

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,630
we've got Nick seal for any medical and

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:48,710
Layton platform honest optimal documents

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,710
come on AGS wave all documents and so

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:58,600
object if I can watch as me I'm sorry

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:03,850
yeah that's we're trying to put that all

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,459
together and implement the cursor prefer

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,849
the full development Shane using issues

00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:12,129
general workflow to him and the other

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:15,190
between implementation of vanilla /

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:18,720
Scalia's Scout zomega's Kabul to that

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:22,150
world football or to look upon data and

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,950
to fulfill a dream of being a giant from

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,950
a design to run time

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:38,550
officer process so yeah it's way is not

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,980
only for taking the people because yes

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,390
Business Bureaus don't like me services

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,360
they don't even know what it is they

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,280
don't want to know but actually when one

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
service is down and they come to their

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,890
application when suddenly they're very

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,220
interested so I think if they had these

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,740
green and red lights they don't need to

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,990
know its services but he's really red

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,709
and green lights amended otherwise and

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,560
they're really happy together they also

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,570
dressed because that's something it

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,740
allows them to give our portal of new

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:18,480
features businesses all times won't you

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:23,190
features that's a that's some kind of a

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,959
of a constant and the all the all times

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,330
seem that the i key is not doing

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,980
everything that it can why don't you

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,930
provide a new feature when it's over we

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,350
are trying to provide this model feature

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,250
that you ask us before well I know about

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:43,350
well okay so what about provide you down

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:46,320
lost better visibility on all I sponsors

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,560
for not their positions and that's very

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,680
pregnant you need in and practice no

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,400
more ideas that box let's it doesn't

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,459
mean to talk technics technology to

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,420
business rules but that means actually

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,569
better aligning RT on business needs

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,360
and that that's a war Tran you know what

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,340
I have said is forgotten and consumer

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,120
yet you last rivet we think the issue is

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,070
mean to spend because of disparate

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,139
parking process because because of

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,780
training services up in a recommendation

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,810
that for that's better than eclipse for

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:30,650
insurers so

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:34,500
we re trying to redo the central help

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:38,870
not look as a service bus but as a

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,820
service mindshare bus as a kind of

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,710
everybody shares the same vision on

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,710
these capabilities that some blogging

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,700
and others are using that to actually do

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:56,970
the work TFA corps is just the bet for

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:59,490
that and that is well rather than formal

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,550
constrain the process of a solution

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,940
changes provide the tools and base for

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:09,090
informal social collaboration around

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,850
services and information about them

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,550
and that for the most technically savvy

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,160
of them even those mock-ups mashups

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,280
providing innocent box and mitered

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,250
manner and this vertical is a square

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,620
that it is work or bike aberration and

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,949
you just would like but trying things

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,949
out

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,410
and for a first one we use in moderation

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,520
Luxio after a seven-month where is in

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,520
order to cross county

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,039
so why follow to Lucille I service

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,360
register what no CEO is a collaborative

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,960
denomination platform so you get

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,090
compression our decided sy is actually

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,490
first caught up in some services so what

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,770
makes you should be for more of it such

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,400
an extension model you could put your

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:08,940
own china-based information sir food inc

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,879
electrification you can relate services

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,310
wait business uses we can virtual trees

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,960
from different point of views two

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,069
different kind of actress business

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,680
technical Ã©quilibre Hubert comments were

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:27,780
close get even preview double in fact

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:32,520
the USDA and and you got overall easy

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:36,770
access using either don't press for AP

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:41,120
is either technical or in the field of

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:44,330
content and tenants gonna integrate

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,330
relax you

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:54,150
second why wonder if you frost candy for

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:56,760
ages relax when I already say that this

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,070
mall is using the SJ standard so a few

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,200
words about the essay standards SI

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,380
stands for service component

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,900
architecture so it's like what our

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,450
service is your realism and what were

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,480
the services they do need work that

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,120
black kind of remote service

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,010
dependencies projection remote trick

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,010
remote yeah

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:26,939
and Mauro SCA is a heterogeneous

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,629
standard its extensive of you could

00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:33,569
support and protocol that again so it

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,789
can describe any possibility s way we

00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:40,819
all say anything about it's running on

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:43,889
on I p.m. or enjoy more people's

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:47,639
assembly press Canada middle way of food

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:53,270
webs so yes we can handle all protocols

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:57,509
I so pressed generous for languages

00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:01,789
Kaskade java organ streets and firm

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:05,819
works large where is jet stream for most

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:09,360
no not them all and lately and God

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:13,099
because of us it's going towards more

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,699
scripting with JavaScript will embrace

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:22,069
or catalog scripts like be sure what's

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:26,039
already that's factor which is ongoing

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:28,889
this press capiam demand you can draw me

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,010
parts of them only

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,839
support for certain technologies and

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,539
towards the crowd and you've got a

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,529
cross-cutting little conference this

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:45,089
afternoon so I'm not gonna say anything

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:48,810
more about it you can go there hello and

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:53,720
finally easiest way architecture looks

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:58,529
like that that looks you can you center

00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:04,260
with the SOA model give up frascati

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:06,839
which is well 100s it all you got a

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,290
light cuz i think that poem you got the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,350
core mobile ones in layer and you've got

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:22,769
turkish for everything tribution x away

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:24,959
black eclipse like Jacob de etc so sure

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:30,060
technical details about Fred schedule

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,980
book co yes that's not that easy because

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,690
these two platform activating you World

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:39,990
War I got more than 100 conflicting

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,630
differences and we're not conflicting

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,550
but different versions so depends how to

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,560
deploy them that you feel got sinless

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:51,150
path you're in for a single treasurer

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,000
you're in for lot of birds

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,960
and one of the things that we tried was

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,020
a sway composite parsing using frascati

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,200
with it looks real as a company party

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,500
that works well okay but when you want

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,760
to try what you fast to stop when women

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,010
start what you fast as a press card

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,050
component well it doesn't work anymore

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:23,340
you've got some place on things like

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:25,670
with Jack kora jabe are so it's not good

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:31,230
news but you've got some good news

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:34,770
however like well boss trust guardian

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:38,850
you are getting with gchat fight in the

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:41,930
process of it and for a party there and

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:45,000
on the other way in easiest way we are

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:48,360
when we started the first time soda and

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,870
march but we've already an emerging Asia

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:57,660
to a pianist looks you're free so what

00:10:51,870 --> 00:11:00,330
we're able to do is at restart the

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,580
western and wii u cos in solution is not

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,700
yet for us jack without inversion

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,040
container within your seal and winning

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,010
that we start the part of fresca dead

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,590
are already with ji fine and it's not

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,390
for us and how does frost can you talk

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:21,780
again Luxio while using or decouple djs

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:24,620
Web API that's not directly time to miss

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:28,010
you and we can implement a either on

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,680
Luxio or possibly

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,020
and that's another kind of okay so

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,140
that's what how we are gonna do it

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,840
actually for no we're not yet doing it

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:44,630
inria is doing that choosing a new CEO

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:50,030
ID but there are already some things

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:51,680
that work and one thing that work is yes

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,780
what we call service discovery by

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:59,420
architecture involved so yes siree

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,180
discovery is very important after all

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:06,860
the discovery using listening to changes

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:10,640
by scrapping web pages when it also

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,820
import architectures such as SCA designs

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,160
ACA components so we first implemented

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,530
it using and parsonage it is where

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,230
excellent it worked no difference to

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:25,310
press carry but by getting press carry

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,080
in well we can get full you were

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,120
checking and full support for all

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,760
protocols that trust can be seduced so

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,220
let's very pressed and it works actually

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,160
by parsing using an embedded frascati

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,300
when you see and we can actually use

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,209
both can starting with some kind of

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,089
interface intricate bank info provider

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,879
in a single step we actually try to

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,369
service coverage double off the remote

00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,589
fast can you run ten days do not import

00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:58,100
any more extra time discouraged that's

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:02,119
making Frascati company run time with

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,829
GDS with yanni is when star-crossed

00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:08,839
carry application or integration

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:10,850
somewhere well you've put in it the fact

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,029
that it's gonna lead to it yes way to

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,220
say hey I just started that and you've

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,670
got some kind of lights hear from them

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:24,230
and that's both you can discovery and

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:28,670
kind of going to say that your rent

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:32,179
articles so it's on that on pressing or

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,569
local determination of this easiest way

00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:38,179
MJ by remote implementation and it works

00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:41,629
well also and that's it doesn't work yet

00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:45,819
precisely that doing the same thing with

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:48,709
it looks you and what's it useful for

00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,230
well it's useful for busiest will add to

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,389
remember this product I think that form

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,610
we did the documentation platform that's

00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,519
all the way too far scary we'll look

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:01,429
shield and that's what we're about to

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:05,499
ship thanks to molarity and question

00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:05,499
