Abstract: Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Architecture's first goal is enabling business agility - and for that, it's time to put people beyond developers and architects back in the middle of it all. To do that, the EasySOA project (http://www.easysoa.org) builds on top of the OW2 Nuxeo DM collaborative document management platform, and has embedded in it a custom tailored
service bus based on the OW2 FraSCAti heterogeneous service platform. This presentation details the architecture of FraSCAti integration in Nuxeo, thanks to Nuxeo's OSGI-style architecture, and how it allows to automatically discover SCA-defined services, and to lay the foundations of an agility-fostering "SOA sandbox". This integration will be
demonstrated on stage, as well as the innovative features it enables such as online collaborative service discovery.
Further plans will be unveiled and OW2 community feedback will be asked about it, such as unified monitoring API along with OW2 Talend and OW2 Jasmine, or contribution to OW2 Cloud initiative projects such as the sister project Compatible One. Real world user feedback will be provided by EasySOA's Partner Entreprise Program, through end-user designed use cases such as collaborative SOA documentation, auditing an SOA, integrating with Eclipse SOA tools and API change detection.
