Title: OW2con 2011 EasySOA : Putting a collaborative twist on SOA thanks to OW2 PART 1
Publication date: 2012-01-12
Playlist: OW2con 2011 EasySOA : Putting a collaborative twist on SOA
Description: 
	Speakers: Marc Dutoo, OpenWide and Alain Boulze, EasiFab
Abstract: Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Technical complexity has overshadowed that Service Oriented Architecture's first goal is enabling business agility - and for that, it's time to put people beyond developers and architects back in the middle of it all. To do that, the EasySOA project (http://www.easysoa.org) builds on top of the OW2 Nuxeo DM collaborative document management platform, and has embedded in it a custom tailored
service bus based on the OW2 FraSCAti heterogeneous service platform. This presentation details the architecture of FraSCAti integration in Nuxeo, thanks to Nuxeo's OSGI-style architecture, and how it allows to automatically discover SCA-defined services, and to lay the foundations of an agility-fostering "SOA sandbox". This integration will be
demonstrated on stage, as well as the innovative features it enables such as online collaborative service discovery.
Further plans will be unveiled and OW2 community feedback will be asked about it, such as unified monitoring API along with OW2 Talend and OW2 Jasmine, or contribution to OW2 Cloud initiative projects such as the sister project Compatible One. Real world user feedback will be provided by EasySOA's Partner Entreprise Program, through end-user designed use cases such as collaborative SOA documentation, auditing an SOA, integrating with Eclipse SOA tools and API change detection.

this way so okay I see that the puzzle

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:20,550
looks like how SOA could be easy that's

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:23,460
a good point of it and and one of the

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,430
ways to make s way easy is actually to

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,970
put on it exaggerated twist to say hey

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,520
stop this is not purely something

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,040
technical it's actually involve

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,930
different kind of actress not only

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,809
developing architects in terms of

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,739
business users we need new features

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,489
solutions and obviously operators we run

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,610
actually the stuff that day so

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:56,460
collaboration between all these people

00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:00,500
is possible in yes wife is thanks to

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,690
other its software so that's why we are

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,840
yes kind of all the way to software use

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,470
case and I think a pretty original one

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,200
so stay tuned you'll get more

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,420
information model in a few seconds so

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,930
I'm not going to say anything about that

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,670
except that anna has taken up because

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,920
it's a full on furthering his tower that

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,000
that's actually using software based on

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,470
ecs way I'm sorry well maybe he had too

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,470
much conference yesterday so

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:42,370
what legend the first a small easiest

00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:46,810
way introduction so that you get the

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:50,230
challenges and then yeah we're doing to

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,270
software in this way its first and

00:01:50,230 --> 00:02:00,130
foremost frascati by inria in Luxio

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:06,960
Luxio and there is a why are using them

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,960
and there's a hole with a architectural

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:19,210
architectural talks and finally try to

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:25,240
put that in pictures using a scenario

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:28,150
and demo demo's possibly even up to 10

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,430
integration and we talked with with the

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,280
wrong questions and scored triple

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:39,040
minutes

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,260
so easiest way intellectual it's compact

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,090
know if it's a systematic yes if you

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:49,030
want from jack collaborative project

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,150
stone sword we have 4 million facial the

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,900
jet to use project starting to vanguard

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:59,950
okay 10 so we are halfway there we had

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,310
the neutral meeting last week you're

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,879
amazing one we've got five partners I'm

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,209
gonna detail later and we've got an

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,010
ambitious team is making

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:18,849
service-oriented architectures SOA

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:21,819
simple news and on the on the perimeter

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:26,889
of business use development production

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:30,099
rules monitoring everything and only go

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:32,470
off actually dropping up the sy engine

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,620
in enterprise so what's the S when

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,819
Jeannie enterprise well for me it's kind

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:42,400
of like that ok that's not attend an

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,609
entertainer okay that's better yes my

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,459
engine in the enterprise in my mind it's

00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:52,659
something where we've got our penis

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:55,269
users with new or evolving use case it

00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:58,540
actually need them to be implemented

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,650
tools provided reaching applications

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,549
software applications

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,530
applications will actually specify those

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:12,769
use cases work with architects to heaven

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,880
the idea of texture developers who

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,500
actually increment the world stuff and

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:23,449
finally I them on the infrastructure

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,160
let's run by RT stop by operators will

00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,710
actually provide the service she

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,380
required service business applications

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,479
to be issues and that's this you know as

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,570
like a real designer never-ending

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,280
process for me yes sy it's an

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,770
architecture it's about a cup of

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,539
services but it's going is first and

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:52,669
foremost to our evolution and business

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:54,889
minded evolution so okay tracking a

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:59,389
place where engine how can you make

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,300
those arrows go even faster we don't

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:06,560
affecting the body obviously I remember

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:09,260
my physics course well actually our ID

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,620
is as you can see that we are not

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,110
competing with traditional s way

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,800
middleware is cross fracturing on pickup

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,830
is be reputation servers that are very

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,990
robust that add the right architecture

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:29,840
for stability hi pail immunity for

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,889
disability transactions for this weird

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,919
military

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:41,729
hi fillet anyone so they do it very well

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,620
and sometimes it's required it's

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,319
required by criticality partners but

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,789
critical needs so it's very important

00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:55,370
that their work but yes most common

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,370
needs are not that critical are not yet

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:05,099
how can I say that sometimes but simple

00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:09,990
super use actually that are less complex

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:14,819
the tower happy to have a less this more

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:18,210
parameter actually and simple example is

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,800
that web first before actually doing a

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,279
big big project you're going to do a

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,569
small pilot project and obviously you

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,819
don't need to you the same

00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:29,759
infrastructure or architecture except if

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:36,839
you do 98 yeah detector but otherwise

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:39,120
why use costly servers costly

00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:44,400
replicating architecture if you don't

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:48,379
have to so how is that okay yes beasts

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,379
fine but why what about adding a lighter

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:56,159
SOA layer but wow this version is way

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:58,319
car and protect it with an internet

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:01,020
layer that we could call actually and

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,889
that's good job is actually to

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:09,089
synchronize this way more between the

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:12,409
central traction is familiar with the

00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:15,569
lighter layer and also to protect

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:19,020
centralized way from be impacted and

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:23,219
hurt by and won't Jews from latter later

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:26,669
why well because the lighter layer is

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:30,779
lighter it's got less foundation it's

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,939
got less constraints I mean actually

00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,979
it's got more constraints because it is

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,949
you've got this protection layer here

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,259
but here you don't need to ask for

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,209
example your main architect about

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,169
putting a service here because you're

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,940
going protected by default SLA

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,560
configuration here that's very strict

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,840
that's very enforced so

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,360
look it's never been scared because it's

00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,889
prevented from skåne but if you want to

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,350
try something out for the diet things to

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,880
make a few calls to get out of you down

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,889
now from some services to an idea of

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,110
where it would actually be possible we

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,389
will include actually be useful well

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,330
that's that's very interesting and

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:22,940
that's what your archery promoting so

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,669
that would have just said and this

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,729
latter layer is not only larger thanks

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:32,150
to web technologies like web

00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:35,300
technologies willing to face and things

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:38,270
like red never but also because of a

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,779
larger process okay less foundation less

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:45,860
constraints and a longline social and

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:51,700
collaborative approach it's better to

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:55,100
involve all actress of s way process so

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,470
yes I said et cetera infuse SOA

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,130
architects and developers and Pakistan

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:05,089
and what's that useful for here is a

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:08,330
more detailed list first of all texting

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,210
service discovery so what's that it's

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,940
not talking to a uddi don't be good

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,060
actually but not that many people are

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,520
using uddi SEO services everywhere and I

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,380
don't say that a beauty at all some

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,660
people being said it's there but I won't

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,150
talk back from the people so I'm not

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,089
saying anything just saying that before

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,520
doing anything with services you have to

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,310
know them and that's about you know all

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,770
the team existing service where are they

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,380
and you can lot of ways to then you

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,270
could scratch HTML webpage looking for

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,390
the best yells for example you get a

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,540
wiki right let's see where WSJ's early

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,089
in the week

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,350
code you could listen to eat Chinese

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:55,800
just say your software infrastructure is

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,259
using a new HTTP proxy that will hey all

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,079
I'm saying HTTP messages that'sthat's

00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:04,889
hope all that's not so bad it maybe rest

00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:07,920
if let's go pixel in your head the

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:11,420
co-discoverer using an architecture

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,130
import if you get architecture diagrams

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,130
we're using a sick standard there are

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,690
others

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:22,730
we even be bought from design time when

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,960
unless you've got that you can grow them

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:29,810
you can't justify you got you can do

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,710
them let's captive rocky and you can

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,470
stop and we think that's very very

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:40,040
important one because sy is first and

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:45,340
foremost what that magic services whats

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:49,220
up are using those using that to do what

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:53,780
we services need which are the services

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:57,650
to work how are they configured and like

00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:02,300
what kind of SLA when we they go down

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:04,940
well we do this so yeah that's that's

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,700
like governance it's different you know

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,860
you lose those two parts the community

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,440
services is what information about

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,110
services and governance is crews on this

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,770
information so first you have

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,810
documentation and color but you'll it's

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,510
a very important point of it because if

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,280
you got that only in the case I'm sorry

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,410
that's outside of developers and

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,270
architects to get nobody on board and

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,430
all business information about services

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,900
will be roses let's do that and

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:40,730
sanitization and protection of

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:44,750
everything s ways so that's about saying

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,930
that if a body was doing a sweet

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,130
perfection

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:53,250
well you wouldn't have to actually you

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,399
know and make things safer to protect

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,610
yourself from for example the wsdl we're

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,720
all fields are optional strings I've

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:07,620
seen that equally ideas including dates

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,360
etc etc I could work examples and it's

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,850
so that the guys doing that our bad

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:17,279
maybe they are but as first and foremost

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:20,310
a strategy decision by the employers of

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,410
saying developer then unit wasn't right

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:27,140
the right guy for that again if you want

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,020
to invest in something creates way so

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:35,070
well at some point you have to work with

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:38,490
problems yet work with in a non-profit

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:41,040
war that's let's not use here and it's

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,470
about translation protections from

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,230
existing s ways that you are consuming

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,070
for example backtracking Chinese of

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:53,490
outside services say your service

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,320
provider is putting up revolution the ws

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,250
yet doesn't change when we have your

00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,140
Chinese he forgets to tell you about the

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,779
new version because well done with the

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,150
UNICEF no problem here well actually

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:10,310
breakthrough ultra because of the heavy

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:13,620
okay well and the only way to actually

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,630
try to protect yourself from that is to

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,410
try to see different patterns in these

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,610
changes that formation very

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,949
and it's a way for the excuse of from

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:28,740
tracking changes that will not be routed

00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:32,190
from united services at your concert

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,100
and even for Rizzo kept gathering and

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,920
fast books type business needs on top of

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,080
existing applications we are working and

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,500
look so it that's kind of what I was

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,680
talking before its like before a screen

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,500
idea about a new feature that's going to

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,560
be developed and get out of IT only in

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,830
six months is from when first just let's

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,020
try to get the information to get to the

00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,300
same kind of behavior out of the

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,180
architecture in a very simple various

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,149
times where you know he just hit first

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,350
if it will work and even better you

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:14,300
should actually useful and that's what

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:17,580
oxidation layer the giant layer is for

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,160
and fabi but everything that you gather

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,380
you can use them requirements

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,630
architecture tests mock-ups to this

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,420
implementation above the existing

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:34,880
traditional robust as resolution if you

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,880
