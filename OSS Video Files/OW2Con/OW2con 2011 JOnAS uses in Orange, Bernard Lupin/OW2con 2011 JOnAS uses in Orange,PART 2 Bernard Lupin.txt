Playlist: OW2con 2011 JOnAS uses in Orange, Bernard Lupin
Description: 
	Speaker: Bernard Lupin, Orange
Abstract: JOnAS is used in France Telecom / Orange information system and services platforms as the main Java Application Server since several years. This presentation shows how Orange takes advantages of this solution, implements technical architectures and uses other OW2 products (JASMINe, JORAM, ...).

	00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:12,019
so when the vacation roll we simply had

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,019
an application server

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:30,430
so what we have a run to head

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:33,370
so all java we use drawn in kirkuk 8

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,560
version it needs that Joanne is really

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:40,460
inside to get yourself we

00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:45,079
join from this regime

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,690
Google of this product messaging each

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:52,129
side an application so in 12 education

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:58,210
or messaging entire application in this

00:00:52,129 --> 00:01:02,210
case we use a bridge this bridge has a

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,460
very interesting features like put my

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,330
key calculation load balancing

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,330
persistence

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,600
this bridge either gonna keep with

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,600
photography like

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:21,930
so you have two applications and in the

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,409
reader you have a bridge to two

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,130
applications are sending a message

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:30,480
to the bridge and the bridge dispatch

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,820
request

00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:40,350
when the bridge is also durable it's a

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:46,610
lot of yet we haven't gone our project

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,610
whose name be one French so

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:57,170
each for was a second verse

00:01:52,150 --> 00:02:03,159
he pronounced amqp protocol for

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,159
interoperability except of google for

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,680
to be able to use solution is courageous

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,100
so the requirements for this monsters

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,000
inc of a key hi away the Kings

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,000
callipygian

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,510
you think I'd just be

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:39,260
when we provide a platform to projects

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:45,470
we dedicate the jonathan stearns to

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,470
administration on these technical sounds

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:54,890
so petronas best interests us is P by a

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,920
giant river to the culture swing tools

00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:02,160
we use the Depot your rationale of an

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:06,630
application on the set of eastern sea

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,810
without service in direction the 80s was

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:13,530
evolving this product to work copulatory

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,740
two versions of the same application and

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:21,240
people users are finishing that section

00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:25,069
with the old version while you quality

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,069
kudos are ready to Google

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:34,650
and we use to address me monitor

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:38,269
application season probes probes can

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,269
correct information on deck

00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:45,540
see

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:48,140
and corrected by after the csv files in

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,140
the database

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,640
with these that that we can provide that

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:09,400
to you schedule is in different so and

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,400
you can you developer

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,060
in a project

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:20,570
we provide in a development platform we

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:27,170
automatically solution of air toxics a

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:33,610
jdk 106 it's not openly in this case the

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:38,530
Oracle ok so many on the power keep your

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,530
PC body to point because

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,990
Indy's installation we have Eclipse

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,990
subversion may

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,710
or pcs installed on the pc and the

00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,139
developer country will between many

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:04,219
configurations he can run join us in the

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:08,120
honda manner that means we have drawn a

00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:16,520
suit and join us pass and t1 join us

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:22,539
Evil das lingo he developed and he can

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,539
use the drone as pretty within eclipse

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:36,830
job he can use cargo creepy to deploy

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:39,950
each application local / UT and you can

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:45,430
use windy

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,430
to give it is cooked really inside

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,550
so because the platform what about the

00:05:52,130 --> 00:06:00,560
application if he starts a new project

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:04,160
we provide in what we call option that

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,860
means orange melon archetypes these are

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,000
projects tonbridge which can be cooker

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,600
and

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,290
patent to create fund issues of real

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,290
applications

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:29,050
each based on mavin architects so with a

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:31,440
simple common line beeps you can

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,440
generate

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,639
yucky

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:46,080
we provide separate attacks can repeat

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:50,160
the most come on Jackie Chan's so come

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:55,170
down or which web applications ace away

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:59,660
with your applications so foil the

00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,660
friendly is ready to use for the broker

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:09,010
if we look inside these archetypes we

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,010
can

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,190
another of strategy about Java prime

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:22,130
locks these archetypes are birds our

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:26,270
recommended frameworks so mobile for the

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:31,720
break free from work for opponents

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,720
injects you and a real architecture

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,070
GWT

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:41,550
Jania said we get flex for the user

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:44,930
interface vertices here because there is

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,930
no real standout

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:54,229
nor easy for these

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:57,639
see except for web 75 on expiry jpa to

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,639
for the persistence

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,840
p

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:22,169
these archetypes are they are convenient

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:26,190
richer or poor infrastructure so we use

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:31,069
them for the key Roddenberry's crave we

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,069
use them with and she

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:48,930
the second rib cage is how do we used on

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:52,180
as the integration test so dragon /

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:57,460
confusing English platform with a

00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:00,769
thousand or ten keys we have modules

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:04,459
that can do

00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:10,149
food integration testing with dura para

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:10,149
hair is an example of what you can

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:20,060
so with neighbor we can we have a life

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:23,329
cycle and these lights at standard we

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,389
have steps in the prefiguration touch

00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:29,870
step of flavor we put too much curry

00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:33,910
download and install from the continuous

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,680
education platform I'll fetch unit root

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:41,800
for that we use the modern difference

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,800
craigy and backward

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:49,800
we choose another modern praveen be

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,100
either mother to you too general to

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,300
political general a variable both

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,839
numbers

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:03,070
so we don't try these polymers for the

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:06,490
web container for JMS order in memory

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:10,690
the Devas and soil and then we use the

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:14,519
melbourne on trend forgive to generate

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:20,950
june estas so the lease terms of tourism

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:24,810
which will listen on 12 sports then we

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,810
use cabo to stop

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:33,230
installed and configured to that then we

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,230
use

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:42,199
Chicago Prague in with another goal to

00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:44,989
automatically deployed our application

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:48,589
which is in a journalist they come in

00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:51,920
front in this deployment plan we say

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:58,989
that we want to first award a vendor

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,989
then who are going to be together then

00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,129
continue or kitchen

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:12,110
in the next step the integration step we

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:15,230
simulate user interface music for

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,310
example we go to the application we

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:22,490
create your order and we look out museu

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:24,310
tests based on the HTML unique and

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,710
selenium too

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:33,720
in the pictures is that restructure now

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,720
agrees to cuddle and victories

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:42,240
so all this is only one continuous

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,240
integration platform

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:51,649
if we decide to change generation call

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,649
you won by 25

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,040
thankful tree and everything is good

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:13,630
so for the next year put out Oh plants

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,630
donating the cloud we see

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,620
some the ants ments could be good when

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,620
Judith

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:30,630
50 technique within the cloud so but

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:34,170
then third we need an API configuration

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:38,170
for example to get status or rotten or a

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,920
creepy or any since I personal

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,920
that sure

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:56,699
you are the presentation of the West a

00:12:44,800 --> 00:13:00,790
theory underlying vc we have also an

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:05,649
entrance to justin diwali to support

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:10,060
laptop set of variables actually these

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:13,750
tool is useful to generate transpires

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,189
instance but some parameters from

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:23,080
technical parameters are not available

00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:26,980
to be all the parameters

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,510
examples of character but he's a

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,510
performance coming up

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:39,620
and true Sooners web Proficy profiles so

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,240
this is we're going today with the wii

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,010
controllers and food

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,570
versions

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:52,740
we want to have just be smooth

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,520
contribute to project in virtualization

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,520
compactor to your cell

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,730
