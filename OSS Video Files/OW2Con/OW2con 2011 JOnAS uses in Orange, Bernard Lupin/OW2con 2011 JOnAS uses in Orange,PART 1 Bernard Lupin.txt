	00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:13,680
my goal is to present you different

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,620
usage we have

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,070
the government with applications about

00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,070
her name

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:29,240
I suggest you potentially five evil 6

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:36,430
answers who will start with the short

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,430
history of ww2 a story

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:47,180
we will see how to do Natha in our shops

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,180
and

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,410
the foot part we will see what we use a

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:58,980
wondrous but jumper Joanne just me creep

00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,980
and so on

00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,430
in the next section we will think about

00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,300
tuna to sadies

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:15,740
I we take two examples how we join us on

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,470
development platforms and an example of

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,600
work and what we can do with journalists

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,600
on an integration backbone

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,829
under Saturday we see what couple plans

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,829
for 2012

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:47,979
so with out of a tube we are working

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:50,460
together for 12 years in 1999 on stickam

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:56,190
witches and the room was co-founder

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:59,530
object when we should know 2000w to

00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:03,490
consider camisa strategic member of this

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:08,080
consortium since its creation

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:12,740
we also curry of the offensive Club

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:19,780
cookie which

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:23,390
with intake yesterday and we have very

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:27,180
tough orange raft contribution to the

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,280
food that we could be

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,890
raveena

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,890
the root of complete right

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,580
extra

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,769
so if we focus on Jonah's why do we use

00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:53,400
donate at front makeup first award for

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:56,129
practical reasons we can suggest

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,879
improvements to these application server

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:02,209
so that Jonah's arc an unsolved to

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,209
empower

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:12,190
for example we suggest everyone to

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:18,180
improve our customer of history truck

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:23,050
that about leaks when quality control

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,980
strategies for generating Java he turned

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,430
to his jaw leagues for the console here

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:36,319
are some examples of improvements that

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:38,989
were made wizard as soon as

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:44,209
journalist or two integrated with other

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:49,689
use 20 w 2 conference and many Jasmina

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:49,689
drawn which are you heard of bangers

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,870
the quality of journalist was program

00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,060
because

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:08,970
we have more than eight years in

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:14,569
production application shadowy shows

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,569
very good performances kind of business

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,960
Jonah the java certified cannot for

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,960
either

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,750
he

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,280
an application's up

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:41,719
just as his basement basic dress product

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:49,080
when a turn or two

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,080
cocoa-touch don't get

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:58,880
and we also have an economy car reserved

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,890
I don't know the collation PDF to

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:09,830
charcoal Africa this is some more but

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:12,730
it's a LPN license and it says open so

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,730
business model

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:23,660
is also of duty for continuity track

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:32,290
marks and Sony and we have unsupportive

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:32,290
moon with very important for us

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:44,910
so the success story we introduced

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:48,090
journal at once telecom 2010 sweet we

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,900
started with the quite old version today

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:56,449
three of three and we're now we are now

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:59,070
funny the Tigers to version

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:02,400
with GI erection

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:09,080
it's the poly application server called

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:20,430
a riverman since 2006 so you join us for

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:23,840
local devil corner and Ed a new terminal

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,780
application deployed on both of our

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:33,260
application server for the point under

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,260
we have big applications that

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:47,330
some products some external products and

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:51,389
we have a short but GAA so developers

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:54,800
Deborah on Jonah's and deployed on the

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:54,800
web ashiq or with

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:06,270
needs today the first publications about

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:09,180
Joyce Nashua ep the move Lee youth at

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,870
key food seven friends and if he's

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,650
higher priority investigation is in the

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:20,479
room

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:25,219
tgl we signed a prescription with france

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:28,490
poland uk-spec orange is necessary and

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:31,069
this question

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,160
we can learn some applications there

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:36,200
were some databases are shown Angela the

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,300
touch

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,480
within inspection freshly ground for the

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,480
group

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:49,669
we also have a lot of experience for

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:52,970
mediations between different application

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:56,930
servers we have quite forward

00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:03,139
applications where he sees a cookout on

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:06,490
weblogic for example and we find we have

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,490
any projects

00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,499
regret their project from one

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,800
application server to to have

00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:20,360
successfully under January we have very

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,360
quickly it back under

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:33,120
the message we used owners confirmation

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:36,089
system that we saw in turn our customers

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
and we move on to join us for services

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,390
breadbox

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,390
for

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,600
it's the main component for a driver the

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,399
structure

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:57,180
we are ready to use the Brooklyn

00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:01,319
unthinkable for us in bed platform teeth

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:08,569
platform can be varied run to projects

00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:08,569
in less than two days anti- that easter

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:19,310
be the platform based on linux and open

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,890
jdk gonna achieve a ver el sol or

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,890
together are connected when

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:40,860
we are hundreds of application visionary

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:45,450
prediction and we have thousands of

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:48,790
servers instances in question

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,460
these applications are of single

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:57,780
instances to large-scale applications

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,780
and forever of stimulant winners

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:15,130
some examples we have two nothing Cubs

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:19,690
applications in quiet or domains for

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:22,240
temper on information systems we use for

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,050
our top sales rep seeds of technical

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,620
applications for ecological particular

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,470
shipment we have poor girls we are

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,910
repositories

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,910
ryujin as well

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,590
I don't go by the name of these

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,590
applications

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,010
ok

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:55,480
we you join us all services platforms

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,480
crystal

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:08,810
lightbox configuration day and we use

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:16,040
infrastructure the real baseball I

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,360
and for for social influence on so like

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,360
going to rain

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:37,009
so

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:41,679
how do you join as technically in will

00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,679
based on local shows architecture

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,579
do I

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:55,720
our flag is based on your virtualization

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,720
star reviews openjdk and turn us

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:07,699
I'm going to be the eventual death and

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:12,589
we have we promote

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:15,699
super architectural whenever possible be

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:20,540
civil architecture are some of thunder

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:27,649
will explain what in the Far Malaysia we

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:31,610
all do test use cluster but in tears

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:35,680
because we think that pizza

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,680
not a deeper up

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:49,910
what is interested eyes donors with the

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,910
tongue cut and drawn

00:12:51,740 --> 00:13:03,030
stack and we also provide for projects

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:07,460
Jasmina sins Bernie yantra and

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,460
Jaco and just be really cooking

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,250
for this is going on

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:21,110
so here are some examples of Jonathan

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:25,779
shall we can meet at Robin will focus

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:29,139
from the aesthetic for the second column

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,139
which is a

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:40,450
we choose this architecture because

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:43,060
which provides very high scalability we

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,940
can start with a small number of

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,940
application server and roll when

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:58,890
how does it work we have load balancer

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:02,880
and they will be happy which is we run

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:08,910
in the distribution true heart you

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:15,540
suffer one for a teepee server recharges

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:19,230
in general Apache all these at HTTP

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:24,360
server can see both the journal

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:28,589
application servers below

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,430
and they can distribute request truth

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:39,160
for these applications that are so we

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:42,699
have with architecture we have sexuality

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,690
precision which was pretty serious this

00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:50,649
application server can be for working on

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,480
the same server working on Apache was

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,480
