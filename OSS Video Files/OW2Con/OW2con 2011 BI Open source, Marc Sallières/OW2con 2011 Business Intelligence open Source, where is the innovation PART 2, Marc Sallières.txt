	00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,679
this is a little information so the

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,890
first research and development project

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,869
this is a project for the Ju of carmel

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,740
care knocking guard for the fraud

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,949
detection and the investigative solution

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,750
and tools we work with a lot of of

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:35,040
partner and at the beginning of the

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:40,020
project we are present this map where we

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:44,840
put the big data storage at the piano of

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,329
the of the cartography and this is the

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:53,160
information coming from external data

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,460
files you your data bars your logs and

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,870
new contextual data are unavailable off

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,100
another database for the over and join

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,990
you put the information here and we push

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,000
your information in data warehouse and

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,360
after we push information in the BI

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,729
platform and over aw honey in French in

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,790
silver other the information on the

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,259
overall solution so when we present this

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,439
to the other participant they say the

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:31,500
decide earth we don't understand what to

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,200
say we don't understand what you want we

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,820
don't know some who where we go with

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,060
that like KTN we have already r our own

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,200
data bars we work with the line is not a

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:50,490
3-2 to have this storage and one year

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,360
after now they adopt everybody adopt the

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,299
map and the solution with if the no SQL

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,180
solution but which no SQL solution to

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,820
choose because we're where we wrote the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,149
adult project is this way to truth is

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,200
not possible for little company to to

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,200
audible the brood

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:16,200
specialists are specialists on all

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,209
solution so we're make some shoes at the

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,319
beginning we have choose I've because

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,650
this is a solution to request from the

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,190
database no SQL database with SQL so

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:33,180
your rosters in the team they can ask

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,810
your new data storage this is the first

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,030
the second now this is piggy because we

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,209
we work with the talent big data the new

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:46,920
solution this is a now this is just the

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:51,920
research project for for talented maybe

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,860
they they thought the comedy they

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,549
present the the solution in January only

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,700
but we want to walk with big also

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:06,030
because big behind big city p.m. on

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,060
maybe it's okay the over this is where

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:13,200
views mouth for the data mining for

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,470
example and to compare with the

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,070
selection of cakes rain or the

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:23,160
laboratories in the in the project and

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:28,200
we are the same result and in the same

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:33,180
performance so it's interesting this is

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:37,549
a sample of big company they use this

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:42,890
just for the joke visa I walked with EDM

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:47,760
for the fraud with a dupe and when the

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:51,570
people of a year of catia see the

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,410
information in the newsletter of the guf

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,680
cambogia we make the same but not with

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:04,260
the big but with you and within but in

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:10,440
open source also for the GPU this is

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:13,579
another way to to request your data by

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:20,489
the way it's interesting because in

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:23,400
years to API or a Deans to request your

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:26,550
data with Excel everybody knows

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,919
excel in the company and the over this

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,620
is weber so you can ask your information

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,710
in japan but with excel you are limited

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,240
for the number of line in your in your

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,870
excel and with when we use the GPU card

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:48,500
machine of carriage system like in media

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:54,320
solution we can push 120 millions lines

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:58,740
in excel and we can ask directly and

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:02,120
instead deadly the information so it is

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,260
for the year or for the gendarmerie is a

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,169
very good tradition for the

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,460
investigation to want to see the

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:20,010
information for a card or commerce and a

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:23,430
confirmational point for example so at

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:29,099
the end we have this to answer to the

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:32,250
man but he left we can to push new and

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:37,849
james bible be like this we work

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:41,970
together with engineering to implement a

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:47,190
graph visual ish basil visualization I

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,349
don't know if this is julep of jiffy for

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,220
me this is jeffy but for telus this is

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:58,250
tulip so we we file together to choose

00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:01,110
the right and wrong for me this is the

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,659
GV because we are a lot of people behind

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,909
the project is too important to to

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:09,210
involve a project to leave this is just

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:13,310
laboratories in Bordeaux when people so

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:17,190
it's different to to the era's giver

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:20,960
enjoying that we want to implement on

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:24,060
the sparrow even they are already

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,000
cartography and Ryan govt botton James

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,830
pago gon shine but we want to work with

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,990
openstreetmap for the open data

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,360
representation for example because this

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,219
is a good good solution a good

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,110
alternative to present the information

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:47,840
on the

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:52,070
data on the back and so in this schema I

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,500
like to see to say this is the

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:59,450
manipulator finally because we we keep

00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:03,080
information from several database files

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:07,690
and Anna and we put in your new storage

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:15,830
and you know SQL storage and this is the

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:19,160
purchase of the purchase of your good of

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:26,240
the boot database for each visualization

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:30,320
engine right silicon and you can use the

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,830
all big data data visualization cart 0

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:40,340
and so and so and you can also to give

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:46,280
your all VI your old bi solution likes

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:49,820
us so now this is not an appletini cliff

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,330
see this is the reality we this is the

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:58,760
research and project and rang but we we

00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:05,390
have already a customer and this on this

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:09,200
map with all solutions so the fullness

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:13,610
of the purchaser is ready everybody has

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:17,660
mobile data visualization data set or no

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,990
SQL database information and just now

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:25,240
eat sweet to explain what is it too when

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:29,170
and why you can use this technology

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,170
