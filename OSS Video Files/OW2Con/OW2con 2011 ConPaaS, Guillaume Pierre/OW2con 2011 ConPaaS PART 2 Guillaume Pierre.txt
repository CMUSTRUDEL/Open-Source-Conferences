Abstract: ConPaaS is an open-source platform-as-a-service environment developed within the Contrail European research project. ConPaaS aims at simplifying the deployment of applications in the Cloud. It is designed as a set of elastic services dedicated to the hosting of a particular type of functionality. A service can be seen as a standalone component of a distributed application: for example, a Web server with a PHP execution module. Each ConPaaS service is self-managed and elastic: it can deploy itself on the Cloud, monitor its own performance, and increase or decrease its processing capacity by dynamically (de-)provisioning instances of itself in the Cloud. Services are designed to be composable: an application can for example use a Web hosting service, a database service to store the internal application state, a file storage service to store access logs, and a MapReduce service to periodically compute statistics from these logs. In this presentation I will give an overview of the overall Contrail project, then focus on ConPaaS: how it can help Cloud application developers, and how it is organized internally.
