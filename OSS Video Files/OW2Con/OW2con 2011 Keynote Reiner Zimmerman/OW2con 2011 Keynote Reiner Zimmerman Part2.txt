	00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:10,559
now you know that that has probably been

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,870
brought to you many times so I jumped

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,030
there a little bit interesting are the

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,029
different market figures for us because

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,980
it gives us and also the people who work

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:26,070
in cloud computing a certain relevance

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:30,150
you can either see the overall economics

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:34,559
so we could save 645 billion over the

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:38,250
next five years says the center for

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:43,469
economics but there are other figures

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:46,800
they are more or less all around very

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,700
soon 100 billion market share per year

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,239
and yes it's quite impressive so take

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,010
Gartner they say 500 billion till 2015

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,680
of the replacement of existing software

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,250
products they basically say we have done

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,810
too long this cycle of projects and

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,180
projects and projects and have not

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,860
maintained the infrastructure which is

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,729
behind it and therefore there will be

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,240
really very big redistribution processes

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,150
now the difficulty back to my production

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,479
engineering background if you have

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,210
something that can save so much money

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:30,270
supposedly or real then in an industrial

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,930
and economic environment there is a

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,939
moment where all dems break that is

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,030
actually what I think there are a lot of

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,490
people also in our advisory committees

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,649
who say yeah but this problem is not

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,229
solved and this problem is not soft and

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,280
this problem is not solved but if they

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,560
invite the chief executive to nice and

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,840
they work on him two days with a good

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,060
marketing thing this is a real world

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,460
example when I was in industry that was

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,829
my boss and then he comes back and says

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,040
what you told me there about process

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,090
computing in our machine tool company so

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,800
all very fine but I by IBM that was it

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,260
he lost his company three years later

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,150
and we all left but

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:19,310
the decision was so much based on

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,459
economic figures which he believed and

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,439
we could not counter counterbalance that

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,140
the decision was made and I think that

00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,079
is quite I mean that's historic history

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,690
and really almost very old history but

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:35,269
that is what I guess will happen in many

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,900
of these areas and when you see that for

00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:42,590
instance the American government puts

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,920
twenty percent cuts on the budgets of

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,319
the infrastructure of their agencies

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,900
they say we buy we have costs of around

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,440
100 billion a year next year you will

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,599
have to deal with 80 80 billion and this

00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,299
is so the so called cloud first strategy

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,980
now if you do that you could do that to

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,459
the European Commission you can do that

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,920
in any company it puts people and an

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,920
enormous pressure to find solutions to

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,829
keep the infrastructure running and the

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,819
only way out is further centralization

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:23,299
father it could create also positively

00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,959
2.4 million jobs while the jobs that

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:30,040
would be lost only in the areas of

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:34,489
around a hundred to 150,000 so the

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:39,379
replacement there in industry is is is

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:43,669
quite interesting and annex I take this

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:46,160
always with some skepticism but it shows

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:51,889
you the dimensions and the discussions

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:57,620
which go on give it quite a high stake

00:03:51,889 --> 00:04:00,639
on the political agenda now speaking to

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,500
you today here these are probably the

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,419
arguments you like to hear the most but

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,370
we built them into the political

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,489
documents so it is interoperability

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,599
locking risks portability of data that

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,159
is clearly identified by many of the

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,799
industrial players especially the users

00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:24,289
then this whole area of privacy and

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,910
legal governance and control and

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,500
security and dependability

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:33,290
what can I do with a strategy I can

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,320
write a political document that in the

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,920
end is a blueprint for the other

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,140
policies which are affected by this to

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,560
bring in this argument of cloud

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,200
computing into the political debate more

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,780
I cannot do that but that is already

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,000
quite a lot now you probably have

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,270
followed a bit this discussion on net

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,150
neutrality over the last 18 months I was

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,550
then in the telecom area more two years

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,170
it was quite interesting to me I was

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,800
thinking you know what is what kind of

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,740
debate is this net neutrality selling

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,260
over the top the arguments of Google the

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,770
arguments of Z telecom providers the

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,740
outcome you can summarize very simple

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,950
you can say yes we are very positive to

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,870
net neutrality under the condition then

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,910
what happens in the network is

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,370
transparent now the whole communication

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,730
of the Commission on that topic is about

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,750
that how transparency and manageability

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:38,060
of the network is there when you overall

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,060
subscribe to the principle of net

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,270
neutrality very similar it is here

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,970
interoperability and especially privacy

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,210
and legal is very dependent on some very

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:54,260
specific directives or regulations which

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:56,540
come out of Brussels one of them is of

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,090
course the data protection directive and

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,490
I just shows the example of net

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:07,430
neutrality to show you what can happen

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:11,720
if you fix the technology or nearly the

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,540
technology approach in a directive now a

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,750
directive is a kind of hyper law it is

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,950
implemented by many member states so it

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:26,060
is not really the law but it is it is

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:32,770
the abstract form of over law now that

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:36,470
is from 1994 a law in a directive in

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,449
data protection and the outcome of it is

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,870
that it became

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,300
more difficult with every member state

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:48,020
putting it international law while the

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,779
promise at the beginning was we align

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,789
those laws and by that we make it easier

00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,610
for interoperability between the states

00:06:52,789 --> 00:07:00,559
now how with what solution we will come

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:04,309
in six or eight months is for me very

00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:06,169
difficult to predict but my that

00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:09,169
somebody sits at the table to my

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,710
colleague senses look your distinction

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:15,169
between data controller and data

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:18,680
processor is no longer adapted to cloud

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:22,310
computing because in cloud computing in

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,589
the end the what was previously the data

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:31,969
processor who has basically no liability

00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:35,569
in that law can become the data

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:39,499
controller and that throws out that

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:42,159
technical concept which was put in 1994

00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:46,240
who wants to blame our colleague Sen

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:51,770
that's a long time ago in the overall

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:55,009
setup now to make that independent of

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:58,759
the of the technical implementation is

00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:02,810
not a simple exercise and that's why

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:05,870
such a word like neutrality is is so

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,300
appealing there is the governance and

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,249
control is you the licensing terms i

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,529
have already touched about it that that

00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:16,009
we still need a nomenclature for that

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:20,180
and the use of legacy applications and

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:23,289
the security and dependability issues

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,360
and they all touch directly on

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:30,560
directives or regulations in the

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,260
european union here you see them so

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,300
there are some policy areas like data

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,329
protection governance privacy security

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,000
and consumer law standardization

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:43,789
interoperability and portability which

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,990
is a specific policy which we are just

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,449
overhauling and bringing in those for

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,240
our so-called fora and consort sia which

00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:55,100
you

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,450
probably contribute to as legitimate

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,800
standardization bodies which can be used

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:03,959
in public procurement that is a policy

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,420
line what are the Member States doing

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,700
what are they doing in their deployment

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,250
of cloud computing and there are

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,800
certainly some coordination issues it

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,760
would be really nice if in some areas we

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,800
could do that together you know that

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,029
there are many policies and I've been in

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,130
that field where we have still full

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:30,360
intergovernmental ISM what we call

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:35,339
intergovernmental ism nice word now we

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,930
are supranational supranational body my

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,899
favorite number is seven hundred

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,589
twenty-nine and that is because that is

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:48,140
27 square if you have 27 member states

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:53,029
and you want to regulate something in

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:59,130
intergovernmental ism it means 27 square

00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:02,600
it means 729 contracts now there are

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:06,060
policies like this in the European Union

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,959
for instance if you work in different

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,000
member states and pay your social

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,100
security contribution in these member

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,490
states and have paid your pension rights

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,410
I mean be laterally out there I can tell

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,360
you what will happen if you have worked

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:25,110
in two or three or four member states

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,110
during your lifetime and you become 60

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,620
and you think now when what will be my

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:34,709
pension it's an exponential curve which

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:39,329
starts at five years per member state to

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:43,130
make the balance and you can imagine how

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:46,800
complex the contracts are so I just

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,770
anecdotal the old ladies would come to

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,310
Brussels to my colleague and bring him

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,560
convey to you marmalade on a trip to

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,720
Brussels if he had sight finally after

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,020
15 years hit over the head of that

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,260
member state to give them a paper saying

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,720
this and this is your pension

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,940
now to do something like that in the

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,200
extreme and the more member states we

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,390
become yeah 28 square is an even bigger

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,960
figure and faster growing figure as we

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,270
all know from mathematics we this is

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,670
where the standardization and

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,190
interoperability is you mainly comes in

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,650
and the coordination issue between

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:34,550
members there are areas where we really

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,550
have to have whatever solution a body

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm not advocating necessarily

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,730
everywhere that it should be

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,780
supranational like the european

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:49,220
commission but to go on making this kind

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,410
of bilateral agreements is is extremely

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,930
damaging to the field and there are a

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,150
few where we work very heavily on you

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,910
probably know that on e identity in

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:04,080
cross-border commercial enterprises or

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,140
endeavors if you buy something

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,290
cross-border you obviously need an e

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,300
identity which goes cross-border and we

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,000
don't have that at the moment there's

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,310
industrial policy and there is this very

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,790
important topic of international policy

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,620
because we cannot build that in Europe

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,960
alone we have to do that in agreement

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,050
with all parts of the world and we are

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,620
in direct discussion with many parts of

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:35,360
the world so there is the agreements we

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,190
have all the the discussions we have

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,010
firstly with the united states with

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,950
japan and was tryna at this moment so

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,660
can we become more crowd friendly more

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,060
than proud friendly but also cloud

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,630
active that is the term our Commissioner

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,880
has used so we in data protection data

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,700
may be hosted anywhere there is a

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,620
specific legislative issue here and the

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,600
implementation of data protection is

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,500
very different in while it should have

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,650
been very similar and harmonized we were

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,870
and we are still probably the leader in

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,730
data protection so it's not really an

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,150
alternative to lower the data protection

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,700
standards

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,870
Europe we could also see this as a

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:25,200
positive step we could say that our high

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,840
standards make it attractive to host

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,010
clouds in Europe and we see that already

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:35,730
it's very attractive for non-europeans

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,190
or non-swiss to put their money in Swiss

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,590
banks the analogy works also for data

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,290
probably if the if the protection of

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,900
your data in Europe is very high then it

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,140
could lead to a situation where many

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,810
people consciously put that on European

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,660
server so it can the what looks from the

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,790
outset as a disadvantage and a barrier

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,970
could well be and turned into an

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:04,010
advantage if we get it right on the

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,010
