	00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:15,059
I'm very happy to be here today you

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:18,060
probably notice that when it comes to

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,510
open source and standardization than the

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,560
Commission has quite a lot of activities

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,680
on going we are charged by our political

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,740
lots and masters in doing something in

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,170
the area of cloud computing why are we

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,660
interested what it actually is is

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,430
probably very fast done here with this

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,399
kind of audience you know it probably

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,680
much better than me what is different

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,129
also but what are the political

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,559
challenges and what could we do on

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,800
European level to accompany this really

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,320
the question so is it a new technology

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,050
we would say no this is this is just

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,920
something which we have seen before but

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,460
as my general director puts it it merely

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,260
raises the stakes if you understand what

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:14,369
it means it makes everything more

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,259
apparent that the technology has has

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,450
changed and the problems were there

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,900
before and especially the one I'm

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,090
talking about mostly which is data

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,180
protection and privacy it has been there

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,570
before but now it becomes really very

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,189
urgent that we find some solutions it's

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,450
a change in the use of the technology

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,790
and we have talked a long time about the

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,369
convergence of all kind of industries

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,700
but this is certainly the convergence of

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,579
telecom and IT services I understand

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,729
there are quite some questions on the

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,040
interface between the two of course we

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,380
want with our industrial structure in

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,290
Europe we want I go back to my old

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,869
clients in production they want to use

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:06,090
this they want to be more competitive by

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:08,940
using cloud computing we we have a kind

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,640
of of vision followed for the last five

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,930
to seven years of the internet of

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,549
services

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,099
and of course we are also under an

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:20,040
enormous pressure to make IT more

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,209
greener further to why are we interested

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,540
it's it's this conglomerate and if I say

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,639
I am I'm understanding myself as a

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,760
broker between these areas then you have

00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,250
here the the areas for instance for

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,260
someone who is not working in the

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,060
European Commission then the word

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,299
European market on single market is

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,879
probably not so dominant in your

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,370
thinking but i can tell you almost every

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,849
political decision is justified on that

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,280
article in the treaty which says we have

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,409
to build a common European market there

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,500
is an industrial opportunity yes we want

00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:04,409
to have more competitive industries

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,709
there is also the digital agenda for

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:10,799
europe in which and that is a 100

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,419
actions but in which it is explicitly

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,859
mentioned that we should build a

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:19,349
strategy for cloud computing there's the

00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,349
classical things research innovation and

00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:25,680
policy now we start a relatively early

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:28,169
in risk research and that is probably

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,349
giving you more than what is on the

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,569
slide what is so astonishing for me

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,530
although I'm an engineer and have this

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:40,379
technical background in this group of of

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,659
computer scientists in my unit that we

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,859
are still following this dossier from a

00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:49,169
research and development part so

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:51,389
normally this would be in some political

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,449
area of the commission of which we have

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,189
many but not in a research unit but

00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,459
apparently it's still so much a

00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,709
technical topic that our hierarchy has

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,199
decided to leave us leave it with us

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,870
although we have regular attacks from

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,290
the political departments who would love

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,400
to take it over so one day they will win

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,190
I suspect if this goes on and becomes

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,620
larger and larger I don't mind but as

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,840
long as we run faster than the political

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,159
departments we will probably be keeping

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,920
it which is quite interesting because we

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,530
have

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,200
fifty percent of our time is making the

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,630
strategy and fifty percent of our time

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,810
is really dealing with the projects and

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,150
doing the research funding so we set up

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,190
an advisory body and prepare the cloud

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,870
computing strategy vision and research

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,930
direction document which we are

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,880
currently just updating and maybe this

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,040
is the right moment to say to you I

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,150
could have given you also a presentation

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,040
if in which i sell the work programme of

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:03,550
the European Commission in which it has

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:05,710
set OpenStack have the funding for

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,430
projects in the research area which

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,700
would build an open source cloud

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,920
computing stack so this report you can

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:19,510
see we are just updating it and this is

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,020
in in the vision of the horizon 2020

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,360
which is see the the research and

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,930
development programme of the European

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,230
communities beyond 2014 now it will be

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,620
very important to convince there from

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:39,070
the communities from what we call the

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,950
constituency's that these things are

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:45,820
worthwhile to follow and what is the

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:48,040
basic problem there is that this

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,890
convergence has not come through yet

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,680
fully although we probably know that the

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:57,400
that the industrial opportunities are in

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,910
the upper layers of software as a

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,190
service or platform as a service not so

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,860
much in the end in the infrastructure as

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,640
a service traditionally we have focused

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:13,210
our research funding in the lower layers

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:16,630
so this moves all very slowly up and and

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,870
there is a difficulty in convincing

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,540
people to invest more in research and

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,580
development of I would say more virtual

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,910
things this has to do with the

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,270
virtuality of what you deliver people

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:35,260
like more if they can depreciate it over

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:38,440
five years no to depreciate saw five

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,529
years seems to me an absurd thinking but

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,319
this is how today

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:46,589
teksystems and administrative systems

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,179
work now a little bit of a joke

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,159
everybody understands of course

00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:53,399
something different of what cloud

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:57,929
computing really is the all kind of nice

00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,759
jokes about it there is also the English

00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:04,079
expression every cloud has a silver

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,449
lining which means at the at the edge

00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,969
the sun will come back even if you have

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,889
a cloudy environment so we made of

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,199
course a definition and what is

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,749
interesting here about this definition

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,849
the researchers have told us they don't

00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:20,969
want to change that the research

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,239
community on cloud computing is that

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:29,429
there was an enormous marketing and and

00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:34,019
lobbying around this definition and in

00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:37,319
the end was more or less agreed that the

00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:41,129
I Triple E decision which is quite

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,129
different from this one is the widely

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:47,789
accepted one I was really amazed about

00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,549
how much money and marketing was going

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,009
only in the question of the definition

00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:55,979
and that shows us with some of these

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,289
other terms where the difficult

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,069
difficulty lies so if you make a

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,869
terminology like this you probably from

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,799
the beginning and we are working on that

00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:10,049
you need I hesitate to take this word

00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:12,359
because we had a nomenclature in another

00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:14,849
political system for a while but you

00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:18,629
need a nomenclature you need to have an

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:21,779
agreement of what these terms which are

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:24,659
on this slide really mean let's take a

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,179
Microsoft definition which is equally

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,819
funny of what interoperability is all

00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:31,949
politicians in Brussels are brought into

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,500
the Microsoft info interoperability

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,110
Center interoperability and cloud

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,179
computing center in Brussels and the

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,829
interoperability which they show there

00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,819
is the interoperability between

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:45,420
sharepoint and work now this is not our

00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:48,569
interpretation I guess of

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,120
interoperability but that is very

00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:53,180
difficult for a non technical or for

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,089
non-software person

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,300
to judge what that interoperability

00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:02,930
really means now it's a bit nasty what

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,089
I'm saying but it is it is in the end

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,610
the interoperability between the

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,860
products of one vendor and not the

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,540
interoperability which we are thinking

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,100
of between different industrial

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,589
activities so here you see some of the

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,230
major terminologies and I guess you

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,410
don't need an explanation or in what I

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,390
think what is needed is some

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:30,410
standardization effort also for the sake

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:33,020
of contractual agreements of what these

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,810
terms mean now we hear this from the

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,399
users we hear this from all the big

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,430
players who could go on cloud computing

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,250
that this is already the starting point

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,089
that very different understandings of

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,089
