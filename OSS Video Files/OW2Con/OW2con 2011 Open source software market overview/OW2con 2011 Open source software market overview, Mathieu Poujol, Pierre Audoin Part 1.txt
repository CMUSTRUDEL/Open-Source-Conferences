Playlist: OW2con 2011 Open source software market overview
Description: 
	Abstract: For more than a decade, OSS has changed the IT landscape and had become a real option for middlewares. OSS is now very instrumental in the success of Cloud Computing and mobility: Amazon and Android being the best examples. PAC who has been surveying this market for a decade, will present an overview of this market.

	00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:13,860
what we're thinking about focus Orson

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,650
and cloud for teaching hours and to

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,260
combine in fact the question that they

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,449
are franchise our fault so that's very

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:28,890
important because we get this this

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:32,009
question very often so that has as you

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,550
see we now making the trip quarter of

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,890
our revenues outside the front so that's

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,520
why we have some there is some parallels

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,290
with all the way you do originally we

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,530
were French and now we have for example

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,079
more German speaking people in our

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,329
company than french-speaking so it's a

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,469
big change for us the advantage of being

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,690
French that we have been very highly

00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:02,370
interested in the open source so let's

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:06,140
give us surely a very good way to

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,840
analyze this market and also as we are

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,330
the biggest european analyst company we

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,049
have also very Europe and you of cloud

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,460
computing so we don't share and since

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,900
the beginning we have say for example

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,920
that cloud computing in Europe will be

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,759
infrastructure as a service and will be

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,110
private and while our American police

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,360
say

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,880
with this a semi-public and what we see

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,610
in fact in France in Germany in Spain

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:40,220
and so on is that is an infrastructure

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:46,030
related and it is private so i will we

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:52,340
begin my presentation by some high-level

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:55,670
tendencies so to add you understand the

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,509
rest of the presentation so you know

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,700
what you see at the beginning

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,310
demographic pressure you know that's

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,350
lead to offshore for example and we see

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,149
that for governments is quite

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,500
interesting the cloud computing with

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,570
this laser on changes in the industry

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,850
especially in the IT industry in fact

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,190
the IT industry becoming an industry

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,550
before it was craftsmanship now is

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,190
becoming a real really industry the

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,370
economy the environment for example we

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,989
just have seen a Chinese company you

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:36,019
want to do cloud in France or in Europe

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,660
because they cannot power it in China is

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,390
that energy problem in China to power it

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,540
and they are very happy about our laws

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,010
about privacy with cloud computing here

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,440
in Europe so you know that's very

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,080
important also to see this part the

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,310
envir unknown part and also the public

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,070
strategy you are aware that most of the

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,070
government have endorsed the cloud

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,440
computing they understood since long

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,530
time open source who had been very

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,600
pleased

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,860
30 year is here we have been invited by

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:16,000
the British government to tell us how

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,400
the fragile girlfriend I've been really

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,720
pushing the open source as a big a big

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,260
change for a photo booth so here it's

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,350
let's say you're more historical vision

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,740
of the idea so I don't know why at this

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,290
point that we could bring you know that

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,180
that's a mysteries and the beauty of of

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,360
the IT so what we have seen with the

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:47,650
ITC's since a long time is that we

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,930
passed from various silo head IT inside

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,900
the company to a more global landscape

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,060
and cloud computing really really shown

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,930
is what is important also is that we

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,880
pass from an added value that work in

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,300
the yard work to an added value that is

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,580
now with the services to business unit

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,830
level to ecosystem level now we're

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,920
becoming like the IT industry is

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,440
becoming like a bus or like hornwood

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,450
meaning that you know 10 is not making

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,280
the injection of their systems are not

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,500
making the tires they buy it a

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,480
conglomerate all of this innovation as I

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,650
will give a greater innovation that's

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,860
what happened in our in our in our

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,710
industry today and we will see that from

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,090
this that open source has been quite an

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,300
interesting catalyst on this boat so we

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,190
come from you know manufacturing the ID

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,950
was really manufacturing meaning that

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,260
its workforce intensive to an industry

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,450
that is capital intensive

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,510
industry and that's unless interesting

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,360
because that's what up please there's a

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,980
government about cloud computing is that

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,130
you know when you are workforce

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,350
intensive you will go to offshore one

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,020
your capital intensive that's Ricardo

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,600
row of comparative advantage you will

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,540
stay where the capital is based and the

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,710
capital is more in Europe for example

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:18,820
the most factory of Toyota that has the

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:22,210
best productivity in the in-ear region

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,790
is days in front while there is auto

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,490
factory data for example in Turkey so

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,430
you know in Turkish a djellaba costs are

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,880
lower but in front of automated it to a

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,160
large extent the same if we stick to

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,560
toyota the most productive factory of

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,060
toyota in japan but if you go to those

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,940
factory you will see the result

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,730
everywhere let's say that 40 analogy in

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,740
the 80s robot hours rit and that's what

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,830
it's important in the cloud computing

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:55,000
and their developer country of Europe as

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:58,300
a real chance with cloud computing to to

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,690
make his spray to do balance for the

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,610
fact that were a bit late on the market

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,470
and they're open source is very

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,700
important because as the European

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:14,380
doesn't master bidder where they are the

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,810
open source copper Cummings afraid so

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,740
here we present to study that we have

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,820
realised 1402 government this one that

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:28,300
was a done this year this this study is

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:31,180
a framework for the program Travis

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,289
dismounted near so where the French

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,419
government would

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:37,149
I don't know there is a we speak songs

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,619
but normally we have made the IT Park

00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:42,460
you know because I don't know anything

00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:43,930
about energy of our environment will

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,659
make the IT partner what is a government

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,330
should put four billion there so they

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:51,279
will take this study to have the IDS

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,889
where they should put it so I think it's

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,050
interesting that you see study as IT

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,729
people you will say okay that's quite

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,759
crap because it's simple will make it

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,559
for people who does not know dat but go

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,229
to MOOC it will give you a very

00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:09,219
interesting vision of where the

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:11,800
government want to go we have we have

00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:15,099
interview a lot of a lot of people

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,309
across across industry I think that for

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,559
in the open source we interview and

00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:24,180
rocky are really so you know we get to

00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:26,619
quite nice little earner people

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,779
something that was very interesting is

00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:31,119
that they are seen with this study that

00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,189
cloud is critical and that open source

00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:36,279
is critical in fact what is important

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:39,099
you will see as inception of the study

00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:43,240
there is a part on the open source how

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:47,110
open source can can put France in a very

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,059
nice competitive way on TNT because you

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,209
know as I said before there is no matter

00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:54,069
where you're nearly no matter where in

00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,779
Europe looks the biggest company in

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,629
either world will be actually in France

00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:04,119
and in just a dwarf when you compare it

00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:07,479
to a Microsoft or IBM that's another

00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:10,869
study that we have done so on the study

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,569
was with interview with a very high

00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:16,569
level people for example I interview for

00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:20,349
this study Steve mice which is not

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:23,979
of of IBM or white and the software's

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:28,089
are this nickname so a lot of people you

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:30,309
know we interview the boss of of our

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,149
merger here in France a possibility and

00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,889
some so lot of people to see where

00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:40,569
Europe should put its money each year

00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:45,009
the GG info sources that be dg7 for

00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:48,130
people who like so European Commission

00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:50,769
there are 1,000,000 1,000,000,000 to to

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,529
put in CIT but you know as every

00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,500
government they put it everywhere so

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:59,139
they ask us what should be our five

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,639
priority you know what can we find sex

00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:06,730
ok what is important to see is that

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,800
where where is the most important of

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,730
course it's called because as this part

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,290
that will help the businesses to exceed

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:19,660
bigger goal to create a lot of added

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:22,449
value to 12 a lot of a droid but the

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,670
rest is also important so what we say we

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:26,769
say ok here open source winner where

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,839
wide-open joss whedon where I say it

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:31,060
already there is no middle where in

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,019
Europe the biggest player is software 80

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,120
so far IDs maybe 1.2 billion euro

00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,130
revenue that's that's why it's more

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,350
cloud computing and infrastructure

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,209
that's normal that's a sense of Aussie

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,579
story but if you want to achieve those

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,920
right stuff you have to manage the blue

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,079
one so information management very

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,069
important you are seeing this with a guy

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:57,250
with a big data phenomenon with the open

00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:59,319
data phenomenon here that's a row

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,899
material of the 18 sometimes people

00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:04,420
forget it but the raw material of the IT

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:07,689
is it the data so that's very important

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,220
to manage Antoine the data high level

00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,980
and high density broadband

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,439
structure how come you make custom

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,269
fitting if you don't have this eye level

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:22,230
and high-density infrastructure your for

00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:25,540
example a very important bill for you

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,930
will be completed with your song that is

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,329
downloading avatar in HD and it's not

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,639
you will get the upper end it could be

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:36,100
him so it's very important to see this

00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,199
top and security you don't do the rest

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,379
if you don't have security so security

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:46,629
is a very very key part and we will get

00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:48,490
back to this after so that's also those

00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,490
our study we are done I wanted to

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,240
present you because quite important so

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,310
now we put some data and facts around

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:03,970
cloud computing around open source and

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:06,490
how preserve our interactive so the open

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:11,920
source market so this poor head we have

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:14,980
done it for Europe clearly France is the

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,649
is a big guy in this market trends has

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,860
started very early especially with the

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:23,439
administration there is a study about

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,290
Georgia Tech that had done and that show

00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:33,309
this also when you see the difference of

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:35,110
growth you can see that we're x 7 x 4

00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,059
compared to the group of the rest of the

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,189
market so that's a high growth market

00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:42,430
we'll see that's also there is also

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:44,439
parallel with the cloud computing so

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,350
that's that's a study that we do for

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:50,680
like five year now so we're quite

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,540
confident in our data there you have

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,959
some country like Germany you have

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,110
embraced open source they have nice

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,610
technology they have nice competencies

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,819
let's say that the log out there will be

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,829
great britain because they don't like

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,899
the open source now it will start

00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,610
because the government I've seen maybe

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,730
some of the beauty of it but they don't

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,920
like open source and also it's a country

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,720
that is doing a lot of outsourcing and

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,350
outsourcers they don't know how to

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,829
manage abs better the residual in this

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,980
room so make it them in order to manage

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,110
open source is outsourcing but the big

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,660
outsourcers does not know where to

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,660
