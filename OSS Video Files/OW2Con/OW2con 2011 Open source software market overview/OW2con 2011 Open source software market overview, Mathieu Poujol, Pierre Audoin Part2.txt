Playlist: OW2con 2011 Open source software market overview
Description: 
	Abstract: For more than a decade, OSS has changed the IT landscape and had become a real option for middlewares. OSS is now very instrumental in the success of Cloud Computing and mobility: Amazon and Android being the best examples. PAC who has been surveying this market for a decade, will present an overview of this market.

that's also what we see for now of the

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,540
market let's say that we will hit nearly

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,639
10 books and soon of the eight market

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,830
that will be in open source very big

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,449
project are are around interestingly the

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,359
developing world you can have seen it

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,160
with oh w 2 as you have quite a good

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,420
number of Chinese on door but the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:36,590
developing world is a really adopting

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:39,719
fast gee open source it's for the tools

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,590
most of the IT service company we go to

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,520
we are seeing every year across most of

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,710
the geography they are using EVD open

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,829
source for twin for tuning open source

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,670
is key except maybe when you are on

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,980
microsoft infrastructure it's also

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,250
standard for the internet architecture

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,400
that explain why is also very important

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,090
with cloud computing and the part that

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,520
is important or so and that is not often

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,229
mentioned but that's very important is a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,720
part in the scientific industrial

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,970
technical embedded market we can see

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,119
maybe you know on droid of course but if

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,490
you go to if you take the latest of the

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,619
harbor's also in fact entertainment

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,619
system is done on open source not a lot

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,780
of people noticed our but that's very

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,850
important for the added value that is

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,550
created by the businesses so here i'm

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,420
getting to chicago

00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:47,030
just to show you that you know it's a

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:53,120
bit the same type of market is a very

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:55,460
fast rate very high growing market where

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,170
the battle will be the fiercest will be

00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,390
in the past because in the past that's

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,150
where you make the rockin with your plan

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,830
and then that's where we think that open

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,430
source is a real alternative in this

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:11,000
world also to create infrastructure as a

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:14,960
service system that will be open and a

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,440
prelab a lot of interoperability also

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,390
scalability if you are paying for each

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,400
one of the vm that you are putting on

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,380
protection it could really cost you a

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,470
lot if you are a company for example of

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,210
the size of orange so open source become

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,870
a reduction and in fact that was the

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:38,120
auction taken by most of the guy in the

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,830
market like Amazon or Google here is

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,900
just to show you a little bit of the

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,110
penetration were thinking at the quarter

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,910
of the market of the cloud computing of

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,520
the total IT market would be done on

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:54,290
cloud it would be especially the case of

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:58,910
the run because now since we're thinking

00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:01,790
that starting in 2012 the normal run the

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,280
traditional run with decreased well as a

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,330
cloud computing we fill we fill the gap

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,650
very big back from the run making quite

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,020
a good number of mission with

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,060
outsourcers that's really a problem

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,800
oster that's really a problem for them

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,050
because they're they're seeing the

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,330
tongue in revenue that's really really

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,630
huge so they're exempt we deserve to

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,150
change the business model I have already

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,640
say that Europe were more infrastructure

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,410
as a service and more private cloud done

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,420
in North America that's that's a bit

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,239
normal we have a very scattered market

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,580
with frontiers with different language

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,770
while we when you are in in the u.s.

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:45,670
from Miami to

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:47,710
Seattle is its asset market okay here is

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,100
a little bit more interesting because

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:54,580
we're seeing often as i was speaking

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,800
before you know of course a shuttle man

00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,530
you say that cloud computing is like

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,440
really bad because of course there is a

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,670
competition but you have to see aware on

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,820
the food chain cloud is mostly their

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:14,020
communities as the package package

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,630
application open source is there thus

00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,110
name is open source with the most like

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,930
to open offices and and youth osss and

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,030
so on but as i said earlier there is a

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,720
part of the open source the higher

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,360
counterpart that and help us we'll we'll

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,180
use talents will use to make his combat

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,630
system this border you know it's totally

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,000
not with with a cloud so they could be

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,640
some competition at this point between

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,950
the two that will see also and for

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,390
speaker went about it the convergence of

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,640
the two is a sweet powerful so here you

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:56,370
have a low added value very visual izle

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,370
and then you have very specific system

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,780
so there is a question we open and of

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,690
course you know you know the answer the

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,670
answer is that clearly helpful for us

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,540
we're thinking it's a friend that's what

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:15,610
we advise most of our client either

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:20,470
technology provider government or

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,570
technology users that cloud we've open

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,350
source is really really interesting

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,470
because what was what was a program that

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,780
stuntman but also people i've seen in

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,120
the cloud computing is that when you get

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,190
a locking in the cloud computing it's a

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,340
very big locking because even your that

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,380
are not there you are not sure that you

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,760
can take your data back when you have

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,430
developed for example

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,910
text in Salesforce there is no no

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,910
guarantee so here's a cloud can I can

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,520
help you to do this also there is a lot

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:59,800
of stuff that are common between crowd

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:04,120
can end your purchase they are

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,170
commoditizing JT but communicating look

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,290
look bad I prefer to speak about the

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,940
democratization of of jit so you know

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,610
with all the money that you say that

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,620
this addis level you can put it in a

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,310
really innovative project and that's

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,850
what we expect to a lot of IT managers

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,530
it's so powerful force to change of

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,530
course you are shaking the business

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,170
model of it official players so then we

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,840
change there we lower the price remember

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,880
when firefox was eating very badly

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,950
internet explorer then we get the new

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,780
version of internet explorer for people

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,740
who like internet explorer that was

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,630
really interesting it's also more

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,940
aligned with a business need because you

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,350
can get a bit more specific on the

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,290
business thing that we get with a

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,810
package with with the open source cloud

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,950
is a different way is that winning that

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,960
will offer more agility you will offer

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,000
more mobility more scalability to your

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,340
visit so it's not at the same level but

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,740
let's say that you get more on alignment

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,470
and also when you see about cloud

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,630
computing it's about services the open

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,640
source is also about services it's about

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,560
collaboration one of the biggest

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,260
strength of the open source is

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:26,080
collaboration we take the project called

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:29,020
mastec at elbows this this project they

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,680
share the share of Java's develop an ide

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,450
for for java and you know since they

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,460
call the guise of boring the same ok we

00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,620
are we're making planes we are not

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,690
making ide for java so then the

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,170
collaborative and if there's a business

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,160
the bitter competitors they collaborate

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,600
on this part so that's interesting about

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,760
about open source but that's also

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,570
computing is also about collaboration

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,240
and of course for optimization cloud is

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,240
the most visible manifestation because

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,670
of an open source is tooling but what is

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,200
important there in this realization open

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,990
use opportunity increase competition

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,120
that that's an important that's very

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,410
important part now you cannot focus in a

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:18,250
very expensive because there is a gmail

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,050
there is all this kind of stuff and open

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,690
source will be a catalyst for a

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,770
40-channel because he lowers rocky

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:30,010
amazon will not have not good where it

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:33,370
is in the cloud computing market if it

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:36,040
was not based on open source open source

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,590
also established for innovations because

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,300
of the stuff we mention already and is

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,760
increased standardization and wagon

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,920
already cloud is deep in this

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,250
standardization so we're really thinking

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:54,220
that open source is easy engine for the

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:58,270
cloud if we see that don't worry does my

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,300
last line if you see what are the hotels

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,180
buzzword in the market today and that's

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:09,220
a concatenation a lot with the vicinity

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:11,860
of most of our studies the oldest topic

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,430
today on the markets mobility cloud and

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,280
security there you can see that open

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,810
sources have real water and all those

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:26,140
stuff are in the sort of a very virtuous

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:29,290
circle so we are thinking that there is

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:32,770
a cloud computing mobility and security

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:36,950
already a chance for a second big growth

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:40,760
of the audio box or smoke mad

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:45,470
and that's how we're here you are all

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:49,630
the website that you can go to take the

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,630
