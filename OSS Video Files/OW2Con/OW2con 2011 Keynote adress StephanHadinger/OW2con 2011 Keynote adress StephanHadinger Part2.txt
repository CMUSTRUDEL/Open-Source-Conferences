	00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:13,110
as you mentioned Cedric I truly believe

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,940
that cloud computing took everybody by

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,070
surprise I'm in the IT market and

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,680
software vendors whether we're very

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,960
taken by surprise even even when you

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,990
talk even VMware which was very present

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,150
in virtualization did took some time to

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,460
understand that cloud computing was was

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,349
not just virtualizing in the servers and

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,719
the day what did you do a good job some

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,520
others did good job also and in cloud

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,370
computing is it really a question of

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
services so when talking about free

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,350
software the model changes it's not

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,450
about selling and installing software in

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,840
the customer on the customer pieces it's

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,610
just running the software inside you're

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,390
inside your own organization and

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,890
delivering services well so then I have

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,620
the feeling that the question of who

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,629
owns the software has a deep mindset

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,430
change because it's not the question is

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,290
how you run the software and the

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,630
differentiation is how you run the

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,200
service is more than who owns the

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,570
technology so this mixture of open

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,400
source and I will go back come back on

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,080
open source and the innovation coming

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,360
from that the services in the cloud

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,689
computing is really striking hard at the

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,340
ID IT market so my believe is IT will

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,369
never be the same and it's really

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,740
revolution and you will find many many

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,640
IT people that did not recognize that

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,380
yet now let's switch to open source and

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,299
I will go back to something that Cedric

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,000
mention and which for me is very

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,579
important about what are my expectation

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,540
from open source for tomorrow's cloud

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,329
and what we I see is two very different

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,479
things in terms of benefits the first

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,689
one and it's been four years basically

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,219
it's let cost for for for commercial

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,070
companies open source is cheaper than

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,200
the new commercial software it it's very

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,520
simplistic I recognize that but it is

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,869
less cost and by the way it's more

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,329
control you have the source you can

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,459
adapt it and so on but there is a new

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,069
class of open source right now it's

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,330
really new services that don't exist at

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,240
all and on commercial software

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,600
so let's look a little at those with

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,400
respect so the first one less cost we do

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,100
as I mentioned we already do a lot in

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,170
orange it's it's linux it's it's shown

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,020
us it's eclipse and so on so it was

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,350
basically copying things that already

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,200
exist as close proprietary software and

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:38,140
and giving back control to a big

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,820
organization and it has had a tremendous

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,070
success on the first layer it's now

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,400
happening on cloud computing it's taking

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:52,630
time we have deep interest in OpenStack

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,370
of course in Zen and kvm but the same

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,560
thing understanding in this way that

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,420
when you look at OpenStack Zen orcadia

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,060
you can find very good software on the

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,000
market I'm I would cite and co2 again

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,140
VMware they can do that so it's question

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,680
of doing more having more control more

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,150
control can also be important if you you

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,790
address critical markets like the

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,709
defense market or when you really for

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,970
security purpose you really want to know

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,950
what's running on the on the server

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,530
because you don't want something back

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,209
door or a thing like that so but this is

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,880
this is the first let's say for me the

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,860
first category of open source is less

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,320
God's most more control but basically

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,930
copying things already existing from

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,630
commercial vendors can the battery can

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,570
be worth can be bad okay to maybe

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,630
simplistic but the second one is really

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,720
new innovative services for most of them

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,750
so let's start from the bottom where I

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,000
see new like new programming languages

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,280
they are all open source and if you

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,780
create a new language if it's not open

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,720
source you have zero chance on the

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,430
market that's so there are plenty and I

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,380
didn't quote most of them there are

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,560
plenty of new languages those are all

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,510
once murder that that only exists

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,790
because there is a real community of

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,910
open source this is the first area where

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,760
there is true innovation committee net

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,900
and it's available for everybody then

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,840
you again it's only a programming

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,280
language so what you do with that it can

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,200
be very

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,500
different from one company to the others

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,740
I will more insist on the uterus which

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,010
is first no sequel and big data the

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,169
second one is platform-as-a-service

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,020
let's take new sequel and big data it's

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,480
all it all it took everybody by surprise

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,340
also and the story is really interesting

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,010
because it did not come from software

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,650
vendors but from internet players web

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,360
players they developed they take

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,570
whatever you want but it can be facebook

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,490
can be google and can be a amazon and so

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,250
on they develop their own technology in

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,840
in-house for their own needs and wide

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,300
scale needs for the most of them and

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
then they submitted to the open source

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,950
communities part of the crowd and part

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,110
of the of the technology and then when

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,780
when they did it we see that with Hadoop

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,180
we see that with with cloud foundry and

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,150
others suddenly it created a such

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:25,360
interesting ecosystem that many players

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,040
then come around this cycle system and

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,979
many you start it's also come around

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,260
this this ecosystem and by the way when

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,960
you look at MapReduce or a Hadoop and so

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,600
on currently you cannot find a single

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,210
software from a software vendor doing

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,970
the same thing does not exist it's

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,950
really new and just do and and forest

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,340
also as orange business services it's a

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,320
new area for for integration for

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,350
consultancy because doing a big data

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,780
project needs a lot of integration and a

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,330
lot of tools and and because it's a very

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,610
fragmented markets so it's really an

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,900
interesting new area to make string

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,720
additional value and to make some

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,550
business and all those things though we

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,530
start to see her from from some of them

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,419
some vendors coming back to the new

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,820
sequel market acquiring some companies

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,580
and so on but basically it came from the

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,880
the web players that's one was a service

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:23,050
is quite the same story and it's we have

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,910
some take take spores awesome or Google

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,620
they did things internally but a

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,330
platform of the service is something

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,550
that everybody is talking about but

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,240
there is currently no market and nobody

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,490
is using it or quite so what I see and

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
we can debate on that we're actually

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,090
think it last year GM

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,780
put Cloud Foundry to in open source and

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,960
suddenly it created a real momentum on

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,380
the the global ecosystem on platforms of

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,120
service they even VMware there are

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,979
testimonies that they put Clara

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,300
California on open source it took three

00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:01,150
days for the air long language to be

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,850
ported to Cloud Foundry three days from

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,650
the maintainer of this language and I've

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,360
came across also active state which is a

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,520
well-known company or an open source who

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,380
is doing a real good job which is all

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,290
stuck at 0 it's not sure it's the open

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,750
towards right number it's also building

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,389
some platform-as-a-service value on top

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,690
of cloud foundry so you just mention it

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,310
same thing do the fact of putting

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,700
bringing this technology to open source

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,860
really creates a tremendous momentum and

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,020
then now I really believe that platform

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,910
as a service will create a new market

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,729
and we'll go somewhere because we have

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,180
this open source foundation I'm sorry

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:42,430
maybe they're not much LW to open source

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,460
project here but I'm really pleased to

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,580
hear that you are adding a lot of open

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,330
sort of a cloud computing project to the

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,520
open source so that's that's really the

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,680
ID and the expectation we have so less

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,620
cost yes but also new service is a new

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,289
business on new business models so then

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,139
again I just remember I T will never

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:07,360
never be the same as before because

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,880
because of that and because of this this

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,780
kind of revolution where we're seeing

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,780
