so I'm really pleased and honored to

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,860
speak here about about the intimacy what

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,910
I consider a really intimacy between

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,279
cloud computing and open source so I'm

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,590
chief architect or a four-pole cloud

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,390
computing I'm working currently in

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,369
orange business services to really the

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,070
b2b part so it's about making money

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,679
obviously but also let's let's start

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,079
with something good and with something

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,489
good that we do now and we're in front

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,660
so let's it's the drink your own

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:43,469
champagne the ID first is it's quite new

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,879
for us is to use the same thing to sell

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,629
to our customer the same thing that we

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,860
use internally in our own IT systems

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,340
this is really true for cloud computing

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,910
as it's going very quickly and also

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,280
we've been also for four years now

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,219
drinking the real champagne benefits of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,659
open source in our own internal IT so

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,970
now in IT things like linux redhat my

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,390
sequel jonas and so on are really really

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,460
a some mainstream in the IT let's let's

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,590
go one step further about what is really

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,799
at stake with cloud computing and the

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,119
revolution about the IT market on top of

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,000
that the the first question that always

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,000
arises is by the way what is cloud

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,450
computing so first there is the official

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,420
standard way of defining at least one I

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:40,079
to be honest I hate this definition and

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,840
it's it it's I hate it because it

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,229
doesn't it's it's blurry and I'm it

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,820
doesn't really give you the real value

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,710
for the customer or for the end user

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,990
it's about let's say it's for me to a

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,790
bit too technical the idea about

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,130
champagne what's interesting in

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,009
champagne is the taste not the way you

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,680
build it or not the way you create it so

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,439
let's and I will give you my own

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,259
definition which is quite sad about

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,480
cloud computing the way do the promise

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,750
of cloud computing for the users

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,019
and it's III three things it's self

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,870
service its elastic and it's

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,120
pay-as-you-go the the best metaphor I've

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,670
found right now is the tap so its icon

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,340
tap and the idea is you open the top it

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,650
flows right away set services it's you

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,040
who you decide when you want to open it

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,260
you open it more it flows more and by

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,569
the way there is also a meter on

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,370
somewhere that counts how many liters

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,470
you've consumed and then you pay for

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,870
that you pay whatever the bundle but you

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,379
pay your payment is linked to what you

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,290
are you are using and this is this is a

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,390
very simple way so I give it it you give

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,269
you this it's a very simple criteria

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,970
whenever and we do that whenever a

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,129
provider comes and say I have a cloud

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,530
solution just ask the three question is

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,930
accessories yes no is it the elastic yes

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,900
no and place you go same thing if you

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,840
don't have three yes and free big yes

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,379
then its cloud washing it's not real

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,900
cloud computing now then when we step

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,569
one step backwards about what does it

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,940
mean to build cloud computing services

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,440
and so as we are a cloud computing

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,599
service provider we have to ask

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,090
ourselves about that so yes obviously

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,269
there is network there is the

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,919
actualization and at the core for me

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,680
that the core there is the multi-tenancy

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,900
the principal ID if you want to be

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,849
competitive in that market is that to

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,090
prove to provision a new customer it

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,919
should be only configuration it's not

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,019
about installing anything for a new

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,660
customer but just reconfiguring the

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,120
software to add a new and you a new

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,239
customer so for infrastructure as a

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,040
service this means virtualization for

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,470
software as a service this means that

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,260
you have to deeply build your solution

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:09,049
from the ground up to be multi-tenant

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,049
otherwise that big a competitive problem

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,819
let's talk about cloud computing the

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,329
same thing is what is the the promise

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:22,140
for companies and I would say not all

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,570
clouds are made equal and it's very

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,880
important to understand also today the

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,460
the place of the open source in the

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,460
cloud market so on the bottom left

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,090
public cloud like Amazon gogrid what

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,600
they take the one you want most of them

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,400
most of them rely on deeply and deeply

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,770
rely on open source solution that has

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:50,220
been often very much customized and it's

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,200
really a question of low-cost and of

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,180
getting the most and say the most juice

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,400
of the out of the servers things are

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,650
changing but it has been built this way

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,060
at the beginning on the upper right

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,890
corner it's more about private cloud so

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,410
by the way is a private cloud a real

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,630
cloud if you take my criteria smell that

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,150
service and pay as you go could be for

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,840
the organization but elasticity is quite

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,420
limited to to your infrastructure the

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,490
thing is for private cloud that we do we

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,530
do help our customers to build their own

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,360
private cloud but we also create

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,880
something which is called we call

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,420
virtual private cloud which is a shared

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,180
infrastructure but with the same

00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,430
security and quality of service and

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,410
network features that you find in

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,920
private cloud so it's let's eight its

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:44,940
cloud Chad cloud friendly for i.t i.t

00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,430
users or legacy IT users the upper right

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,850
corner is really the world of vmware

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,640
today vmware has I think eighty-six

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,120
percent market share in companies for

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,950
their tool ization and and we also in

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,280
orange use a lot am wear it with

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,310
something like 18,000 vient running in

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,160
production and so this is really an area

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:12,930
where vmware is very present i would say

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,950
it's not very cheap by the way and so we

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,900
are we're seeing this kind of

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,910
confrontation between this the world of

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,050
open source and the world of this hi

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,550
let's call it high-end cloud computing

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,060
so we do in in orange business services

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,580
we do this virtual private and private

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,650
cloud we don't do at all yet public

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,340
cloud or let's call it low cost public

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,700
cloud we do have plans for that I wish I

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,100
could say more because it's

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,290
still an under the process of creating

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,200
so I can only tell you what has been

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,180
leaked in the media's saying that we

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,910
have a project which is called Andromeda

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,720
about creating some public cloud French

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,550
public cloud with some investment of the

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,800
French state investment from OBS and

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,530
from other other companies and when I

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,360
talk about its big investment by the way

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,430
for orange and what's what's been in the

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,860
press something like 60 60 million euros

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,520
investment tools it's serious money so

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,340
we will also address this public open

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,570
source-based low-cost cloud cloud

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:24,280
computing infrastructure and so this is

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,280
