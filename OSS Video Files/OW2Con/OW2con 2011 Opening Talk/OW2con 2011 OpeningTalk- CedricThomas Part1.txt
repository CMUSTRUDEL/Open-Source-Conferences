this quick presentation to open the the

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,009
conference is about the state of a w-2

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,100
but not only what we are but where we

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,189
are we are in market that has been

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,760
launched about 30 years ago in September

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,910
83 when Richard Stallman sent a mail

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,400
saying it was going to develop a new and

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,230
unique three UNIX operating system and

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,520
then he went on to define the four

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,010
freedoms that define what we do today

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
the first freedom is the freedom to use

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,420
the software for whatever you want to do

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,120
which is something you cannot do with

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,879
proprietary software the second freedom

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,379
is the freedom to study the software to

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,629
look at it and to adapt it to your needs

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,360
which is something you cannot do with

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,020
proprietary software the third freedom

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,359
is the freedom to redistribute copies of

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,890
the software you've been using again

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,939
something you cannot do with proprietary

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,460
software and the last freedom is the

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,770
freedom to modify that code and to

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,350
reduce you with modified copies of this

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,290
code which is something you cannot do

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,750
with proprietary software at these four

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,979
freedoms have the power to change the

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,619
way the software industry is operating

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:27,479
that defined free software and free

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,490
software has evolved through dubious

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,759
ways into what we call commercial open

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,250
source commercial open source is now

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,070
taking a market shares in the software

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,450
industry to the point that in a any

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,689
product category of segments categories

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,509
that has been defined by pro patria

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,659
vendors now there is an open source

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,780
alternative the whole market is shifting

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:59,549
to open source but you might say this is

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,200
more copying these product categories

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,530
that have been defined by property

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,079
vendors are now emulated and reproduced

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,149
and developed and the new rules by

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,830
software open source software vendors

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:16,950
that was until let's say 2010

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,410
but something happened in 2010 and we

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,050
realize that with cloud computing

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,930
appearing and all proprietary vendors

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,950
taken by surprise open source is now

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,640
racing with proprietary vendors we are

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,570
innovating and that's why we chosen this

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,760
theme today open source the innovation

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:45,420
drive open source is to innovation what

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,450
low interest rates are is to economic

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,170
recovery we helped free defy we helped

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,980
accelerate innovation and today what we

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,630
do in cloud computing is

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,240
state-of-the-art and it is at par with

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,850
what property vendors are doing so

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,250
that's what we do here our mission in

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,140
the middle in this context is to be a

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,110
community a global community working

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,890
together to develop a code base of a

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,220
bridge of software and to because we

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,900
understand that it's all about business

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,890
to develop a business ecosystem our

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,600
members join us for the technology but

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,060
also for their own interests we

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,200
understand that we've managed with the

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,840
w2 to create a global organization the

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,290
open-source market is defined by its

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,220
research teens its development teams but

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,459
also by its third-party organizations if

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,920
I organize the organizations in six

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,430
categories we first have at the bottom

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,019
of the organizations that define the

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,680
standards there is no open source

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,720
without open standards then we have the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,540
organizations that help promote open

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,540
source build the awareness these

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,890
organizations create a change the minds

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,310
of people and they help people

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,070
understand what's at stake then we have

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,980
the organization's developing the legal

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,690
framework on open which open source is

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,250
developing open source is not a vendor

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
buyer it based on the vendor by a

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,870
relationship it's more based on

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,100
cooperation rules and this legal

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,920
framework defined the rules by

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,290
we operate then we get into the

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,080
technology we have the grassroots

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,480
communities those sharing the range and

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,580
interest for a state of the art of

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,890
breakthrough technologies more or less

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,560
organized then we have the

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,160
organization's going up that concentrate

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,660
on product lines they're very efficient

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:55,900
they develop a narrow set of

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,960
technologies but when you look at them

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,020
you realize that they are controlled by

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,730
a private company and those

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,730
organizations are controlled by private

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,460
companies have to follow the stakes of

00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,600
the private companies and when you think

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:17,380
of very cool very recent example the

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,450
symbian community disappeared when the

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,400
company that was controlling it decided

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,090
to repop reader at Rice this operating

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,960
system and then you have the independent

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,110
organizations those that concentrate on

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,350
developing a business ecosystem there

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,390
are four of them in the world we may be

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,330
a distant for we're very modest we do a

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,140
job well but we know that we're in good

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,190
company with the Linux Foundation the

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:51,180
Eclipse Foundation and the Apache

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,900
foundation we are in this context the

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,180
infrastructure the open-source

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,960
infrastructure community that's what we

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:02,350
concentrate on that's what we do now

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,420
what who who and what we are how we

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,400
organized so let's have a look at the

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,770
other view too many of you you know that

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,370
do you know that's picture this is

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,960
audibility in one picture we start with

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,110
a code base at the center we have the

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,050
code base we do not exist without the

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,310
code base that code based is developed

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:28,840
by a community that community works in

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:31,750
the framework of activities everything

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,900
runs smoothly because of our open source

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:39,070
governance and we keep our independence

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,270
because our members pay their fees so

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,530
what do we do

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:48,130
our code base we have today one had

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:52,270
weakened 116 project on the on the under

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:56,800
code base about one-third mature 113

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,980
incubation one-third in in archives the

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
metro project has those that lead to w2

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,000
today but those in incubation at those

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:11,680
that represent tomorrow tomorrow's lw2

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,460
in 2012 since last open to other video

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,460
