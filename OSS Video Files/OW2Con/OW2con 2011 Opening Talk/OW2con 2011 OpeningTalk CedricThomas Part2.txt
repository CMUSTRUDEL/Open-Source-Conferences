out of those nine new project five of

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:16,020
them target cloud computing environments

00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:21,199
that gives you an idea of where we

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:25,740
heading to our membership our community

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:29,160
includes 1,600 individual members and 60

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:34,050
companies organizations universities

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:38,760
research centers across the world since

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,910
the last conference we integrated 14 new

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,410
members of course some members have left

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,989
us because they've changed the

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,620
strategies but we maintain our growth in

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,610
membership members come from all over

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,680
the world it's true that maybe we should

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,820
do a little bit of some effort in Brazil

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,840
and we know that in 2012 will also make

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,170
an effort in in Europe and North America

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,610
the governance not the activities in

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,520
we've launched the open source cloud

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,159
where initiative which is today probably

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,729
the largest community effort in the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,049
world developing open source code for

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:26,460
cloud computing with 30 over more than

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:29,159
30 participants we've invested we

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,439
involved or w-2 in the collaborative

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,200
project called correos that develops

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:41,490
choreography web service choreographies

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,040
for for ultra large-scale development

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,780
deployment and we target the future

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,950
internet what they call the internet or

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,479
the future we've also involved auto be

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,600
two in a project called compatible one

00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,149
which develop the technologies that

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:07,009
offers interoperability to Cal computing

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:11,940
users our governance a board meets

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:13,770
regularly since last conference six

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,740
times so it's roughly

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,130
every every other month the Board makes

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,000
the check the budget makes the long-term

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,750
decisions and we also rely in our

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,250
governance under technology council that

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,450
technology council meets more often and

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:40,200
is the group of the project leaders and

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:42,870
they decide of the orientations to

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,810
accept new project and they control all

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,450
the the controller they provide our

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,110
guidance for everything technology in

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,800
our organization with the money we get

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,470
what do we do we run a technical

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,830
infrastructure one that provides all the

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,680
tools that developers might need to

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,140
render project and we do have very

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,170
demanding developers so with the we've

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,540
got Jeff Olson a person's fault but we

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,400
also implemented a github get

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,220
architecture with guitar an instance of

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:26,030
guitar is running in Adobe two and a get

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:30,150
up space we have continuous integration

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:33,390
we have bug trackers we have mailing

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,990
list wiki's instant messaging

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:43,140
technologies all this is run on in 24 by

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:45,420
7 every day and you know here in the

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,550
room because you use that that it's a

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:53,630
primal reliable infrastructure we also

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,940
do marketing and we do a lot of that

00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,150
exhibitions and conferences nearly once

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,630
a year in February 2010 we went to cloud

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,470
computing Europe haldex for europe in

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:11,489
march IT cloud in Paris inmate solution

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,500
Linux in paris in june physiol in porto

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,560
alegre brazil where we did several

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,120
presentations in july we were we were at

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:25,710
austin where our booth was pretty pretty

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,920
successful in September we had extensive

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,730
presence at

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,620
the open world forum in Paris we also

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:36,910
co-organized the OpenStack summit in

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:40,210
Paris we also had in October the cloud a

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,150
90 exhibition in paris and last but not

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,790
least we organized the china open source

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:50,380
week with four events in china reaching

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:54,040
almost 1,000 people so that's that's a

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,870
lot that's a lot of work and this cannot

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,840
would not be possible without the team

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,720
we have here so i see they are here in

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,960
the room so first of all what i want to

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,030
thank alex alex is here there is

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,790
kathleen well send out like people can

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,620
see you get win who does all the the

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:17,830
events organization lekshmi who's

admitted in support and visually me

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,840
khesari who's the sysadmin who's here

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,930
and standing up there behind the camera

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,260
Olivia Arizona who's a webmaster so this

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,180
is a small team to do what we do and we

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,380
hope you think we do it well we try our

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,360
best and we here to to check with you

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,480
progress and an exchange but what your

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,790
expectations are for the bit so we do

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,330
that but it's not just activities for

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,450
the sake of spending your money and

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,550
developing code we also have a strategy

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,000
because we understand environment so

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,260
what we've done a strategic plan and

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,430
unfolds as follows in 2010 we launched

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,710
the open source cloud where initiative

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,720
that initiatives positioned ow2 center

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,530
stage in the open source cloud computing

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,700
market we now are recognized by all the

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:22,420
major players in this market and we

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,110
carry on this effort many conferences

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,210
today presentations today and the

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,600
keynote speaker the keynote speeches and

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:35,920
the cloud computing summit tomorrow are

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,910
reflects these the efforts we're doing

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,910
in the cloud computing area

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:45,800
but code just for the sake of code is

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:49,250
not enough we want to impose this code

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,530
on the market and that's why we are

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,509
developing the second stage of our

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:59,139
strategy or the 336 Reggie in 2011 which

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,360
we call squat and squat stands for

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:07,780
software quality assurance and

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:11,660
trustworthiness the idea is to test or

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,360
armature projects with a number of tools

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,830
that are recognized by the market and to

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,680
publish the results so users have full

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,599
information on the project and the

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,330
perceived reliability of the limited

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,060
project will be just as comparable as

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,740
that of proper proud of software

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,810
available from proprietary vendors

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,090
that's the idea we are today about 90%

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,970
into the development of these this

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,570
program which will be fully available in

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,880
AZ from january two thousand twelve and

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:52,699
next year all amateur projects will be

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:55,190
squad compliant and beyond that so what

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,219
we're going to start doing in 2012 now

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,349
we have state-of-the-art code reliable

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,380
code we will start making it available

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,449
to the end users and will develop

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,969
something we call an app store I mean

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:12,110
the name is too yet to be found to be

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:15,830
found and we will make aloo Gobi to code

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,969
readily available for the market so as

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:22,250
to grow beyond the very nice community

00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:24,380
of developers and technology we have

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,469
into something that becomes much more

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:33,589
mainstream so the plan is to make a w2

00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:38,089
mainstream by 2013 once again we're very

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:39,770
proud to have these sponsors this

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,229
sponsorship is this testimonial to the

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,860
quality of what as a community we've

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:50,060
achieved so far a positioning we hope

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,209
our conference reflect what we've done

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,689
what we're doing

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,610
the other Bluetooth conference is a

00:08:54,689 --> 00:09:02,889
progress report is a snapshot of what we

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:05,350
do for musicians is like making records

00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:08,550
this is our record and I hope you

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,550
