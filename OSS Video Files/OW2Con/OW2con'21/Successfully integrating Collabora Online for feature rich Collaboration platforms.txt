[Music]

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,160
well hello

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,440
i'd like to talk about integrating

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
calibre online for

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,279
feature-rich collaboration getting all

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
of that goodness uh from collaborator

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
online built on this amazing libreoffice

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,320
technology

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
um known and loved by many people and

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
turning it into rich

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
secure you know interoperable beautiful

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,760
uh collaborative

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,360
document editing so we're doing really

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,480
well it's it's

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,160
very encouraging um million or million

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,559
and a half docker image downloads every

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,160
month

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,000
and people getting excited and

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
integrating collab line with lots of

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,480
things

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
and the great thing is that we can then

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,239
bring you know that control of your data

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,920
digital sovereignty to everybody uh

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
our architectures i guess it's bet on

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
cpu threads and network getting cheaper

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,760
and we just love to work with people

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
like amd who are doing amazing work

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
to uh you know just make hardware much

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
more powerful

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
uh bring bring those rich server uh

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,400
hardware with just

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
a wealth of threads and compute that we

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
can use uh across your network to give

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
you just a beautiful slick editing

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
lots of lovely features hopefully you're

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,280
familiar with those

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,560
easy collaboration just uh you know

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
compound

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,159
beauty we continue to work to improve

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,439
the design but lots of

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,360
lovely things going in here and a

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
wysiwyg experience uh

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,159
you're you're really seeing what you're

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
gonna get when you're printed out you

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,520
know you're not sacrificing

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,479
uh anything for your web uh usage there

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
um spreadsheets working very nicely uh

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,159
again

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,960
i guess presentations and some more more

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
good stuff

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
and in terms of digital sovereignty we

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,399
really don't lay your document data out

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,880
of your your your site as it were

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
uh so you know the document data is held

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,799
in your server room and it's not sent to

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
every device to be controlled by some

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
javascript enforcement policy

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,159
we're sending pixels to the clients and

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
we can even watermark those to make sure

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
that they're really

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,119
um you know they really are not going

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
out uh to anyone you know you can take a

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
screenshot but it's got your name all

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,520
over it

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,640
so you're just providing that granular

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
control

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,080
and management of your document data and

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
keeping it

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
safe and of course we love to integrate

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,360
with people

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
we're really thrilled to uh to see that

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
so in moodle for example

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
uh great to just be able to share your

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
classroom editing you know these locked

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
down times

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
uh your documents and allow other people

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
to edit those with you

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,720
uh collaboratively or you know just just

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
setting um

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
in a classroom uh assignments and so on

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
um alfresco

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
some beautiful integrations there thanks

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,280
to jackie who are doing that now

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
um e-groupware uh some some great stuff

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,319
there colab

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,080
our next cloud is very familiar to lots

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,440
of people of course as well

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,200
uh similarly um matamos for your chat

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
uh needs if it's not integrated in one

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
of these other things a sharepoint you

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
know we can show publisher files and

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
visio files you know inside your

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,680
your sharepoint which is kind of cool

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
noxio

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
um and if your integration isn't there

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
you know it's now

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
even easier to make your own so in the

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
last uh couple of months i think

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,239
we've published uh just a much extended

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,879
sdk

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
with great documentation uh sample codes

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
in

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
all sorts of languages so we have i

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,040
think python we have php

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,640
we have node js all

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,000
sorts of different pieces of code that

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,440
you can reuse to create a very quick

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
integration and it's really easy do just

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
check that out everything you need's

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,000
there

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
code is easy to get uh easy to install

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
so you just

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
downloaded lots of ways to do that

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,120
through univention uh app center for

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
example or code docker images

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
uh from docker have also packages you

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
can build your own source code of course

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
and that's easy and just uh install and

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
play with that and we provide

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
essentially a stateless drop-in micro

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
service it's a pretty

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,879
powerful and big micro service um but

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
the good news is that it's not

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
complicated you know we

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,720
we save say this moodle example here you

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
know we save all the document data back

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
to

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
the back-end that integration and we

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,840
rely on

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,000
authentication coming from that back-end

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,920
too so i really we're not

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
storing your documents we're not doing

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,799
complicated authentication stuff this is

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,120
very simple

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,280
a whoppy like api that allows us to plug

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
into all those integrations

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,840
and maybe yours too and uh makes it

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,080
trivial to install and scale this thing

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
um which is which is kind of cool of

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
course we were working very hard on

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
features and our improvements

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
so so what i've been doing in the last

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
year or so well the first thing we've

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
done

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
is i really just um provide you with

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,680
options

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
so there are some people who love them

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
or say google like

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
traditional menu and toolbar i think you

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
can see at the bottom

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
and that's that's been absolutely great

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,880
but if you pull the latest version you

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,199
then have a choice

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,120
uh you can use a notebook bar here which

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,520
is perhaps more familiar to microsoft

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
office users and with these pallets uh

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,600
tabbed palettes then

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,039
a notebook bar of of features um with

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
with previews there are things like

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
styles you know the extra space allows

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
you then to do

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
uh do some of that a previewing thing

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,240
and cool

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,360
we have pdf search uh collaboration so

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
you can

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
annotate your pdfs and collaborate

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
around them search inside them

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,440
as you render them there the secure view

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,479
lots of business interoperability work

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
here's one from

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
for taiwanese customers that want to

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,800
have these gutter margins you know for

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,039
binding your printouts

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
uh and making sure there's enough space

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
there and doing that in a nice

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
interoperable way i'm so even working on

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
font work

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,240
so you know people like these uh

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,080
complicated and funky looking uh

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
different ways of rendering text

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
graphically for impact we've

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
done whole little work on freeze panes

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
so making calc just much easier to

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
navigate

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,680
um much much simpler to see your

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,520
your data and what column is what macros

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
before anyone panics too hard this of

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
course is off by default

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
the administrator can turn it on and

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
then the user can decide

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759
whether they are going to run those

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
macros or not and those happen inside

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
this very secure jail

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
environment we have but beyond that you

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
can then run your vba macros and start

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
to bring some of those little

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,919
business process tools that have been

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,520
written um directly into the cloud and

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
provide those then in a way that doesn't

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
require

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,960
a specific version of microsoft office a

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
specific you know database thingy or

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
whatever

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
you can provide those then very easily

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
on lots of devices

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,000
inside the browser and you can have you

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
know formulae or

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,039
your complex greeks can can all be

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
working

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,479
inside your financial spreadsheet which

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
is great

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
um better sheet movement our pivot

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
tables

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
are creating and customizing those and

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
this is a an example of the the new way

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,919
we're doing dialogue so bringing them

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
all to the client side and then

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,759
constructing those out of json so

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
not using uh i guess libreoffice widgets

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
anymore but

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,800
uh doing all that in a themeable css way

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,319
on the client which is kind of

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,880
exciting new new approach defining names

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
uh managing those and actually we're

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
starting to bring that approach of new

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
dialogues to the sidebar too

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
so which will accelerate and make that

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,759
crisper a whole wealth of statistical

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
tools for data analysis if you're if

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,440
you're into stats and your data

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
and sharing that and seeing what's going

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,759
on so we can do some really uh

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
good things there and we've also brought

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
draw that

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,759
quite a lot of our educational customers

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
wanted uh to be able to draw

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
our posters and you know just learn to

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
do that communication

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,280
the communication skill that's so

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,199
valuable there so being able to edit

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,720
uh you know shapes and connectors and

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
flowcharts and

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
technical drawings are bringing the font

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,759
work in and you can see that on a mobile

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,080
device there as well

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,960
um what else are mobile simplifying

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,120
comments

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
uh so that we can you know we have have

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
lists of those instead of

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
sort of floating them on the side of the

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,479
document we can have them

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,080
in this pane at the bottom and of course

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
there's loads of stuff that you can see

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
but you can you know you can't see but

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,360
you can feel

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
so significantly faster rendering time

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
in in various

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
various cases much faster rendering but

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
in many cases

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,360
just faster tile rendering left and

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,199
right a better interactive cell editing

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
more rapid jail setups a quicker

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
document load

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
better watermarking if you're turning

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,479
turning that on for secure view

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
better slide content pre-fetching for

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,960
rapidly moving through presentations

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
uh better on demand thumbnailing for

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
very large

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,960
presentations with hundreds and hundreds

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
of slides so that

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
you know we just do that much more

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
intelligently um improved pdf rendering

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
thumbnailing download speeds a big big

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,959
improvements to downloading and copying

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,120
large paste performance

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,120
much better crispness so you're doing a

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
whole lot of work to better align pixel

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,760
grids on the on the client inside the

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,560
canvas

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,080
uh with the server and uh just improving

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,600
the the smarts around rendering that

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
doing much more rendering on the client

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,160
side

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
so your calc grid should be drawn on the

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
client and not on the server

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,200
um and then all of your clever merging

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,279
bits can be uh handled

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,440
uh and yeah just getting rid of some of

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
these somewhat unnecessary anti-aliasing

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,839
blur so rendering more and more in the

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,800
html canvas

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
rather than having svg layers on top of

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
css

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,880
images which has allowed a number of

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,600
great optimizations

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,279
um we're moving to typescript so just a

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
much better type checking underneath

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,440
much more maintainable code

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,480
a better quality there cyprus automated

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,920
test coverage

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,240
i i forget 100 cyprus test uh

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,360
suites they're doing doing things behind

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
the scenes to make sure that

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
we're not regressing and all of that of

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
course connected with continuous

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,399
integration so all of the commits are

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
tested

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
with with much more detail as they go in

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
now uh cluster debugging

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
so sometimes people so it's very

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,920
important when you set up your cluster

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
to make sure that everybody going to one

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,839
document ends up in the same

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
process space on the other end so we've

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
been doing a lot of work to make it

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
easier to check

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
when that's that's happening and debug

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
that just cook

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
so as you as this is admin don't deploy

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
it and think it works nicely and then

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
realize that actually you are

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,480
you're fooling yourself so just better

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,399
ways to check those server ids

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
and yeah much more i can't tell you

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
three and a half thousand uh commits

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
uh in online in the last year just

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,560
innumerable bug fixes and improvements

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
and of course bringing that to you know

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,120
bring your own device so

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
uh you know using the online responsive

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
ui

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
natively for apps so you can be

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
disconnected from the internet and still

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,279
have all of that

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,160
rich a one-handed touch user interface

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
improvements then on ios to to make this

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
nicer

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
uh bringing that same android app then

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
to chromebooks

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
and actually you know providing this

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,200
whole rich user experience then inside

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
chrome os

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,519
uh for often used in education for

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
students and other people there

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
and providing that you know just that

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
full pc

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
uh experience on chrome os it's great to

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
see that there

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
so what's coming next well glad you

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
asked

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
and really looking forward to seeing

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
people in person too i must say um

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,880
when the world changes but really

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
improving performance there's a lot of

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,320
profiling going on at the moment

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,760
are we having end-to-end profiling built

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,279
in so in a single graph you can see

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,560
what's happening in your browser

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,320
and you can see what's happening in the

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,920
your server daemon and then what's

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,200
happening in your specific libreoffice

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,120
kit document

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
a back end and then joining all those

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
together into single profile so that we

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
can work out where the bottlenecks are

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
and when we started to do this we

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,880
discovered amazingly the browser

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
was one of our blind spots lots of silly

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
stuff happening in the browser so we've

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
really been accelerating the rendering

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
there

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
which turned out in many cases to be the

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,480
bottleneck so uh

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
yeah lots of lots of good good things

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
there and

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
of course speed ups in in the call to uh

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
dropping some off off screen idle

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
painting in into buffers that i never

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
use

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
we're also improving the design and just

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
putting more effort into that pedro

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,120
working a hard time

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
full time now with the community just

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
polishing the ux

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,160
refining and tweaking and cleaning a lot

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
of those small things

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279
and i mentioned the sidebar which is

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
making that just

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
much better so that we should have a

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,639
consistent beautiful

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,480
user experience for our next major

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,760
release in in 2021

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,760
and of course pulling in the latest

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,800
libreoffice technology under the hood to

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
uh get that

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,839
ah see much better so it's fun to get

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,760
involved

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
uh you can get involved in two ways

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,200
either with libreoffice

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,800
uh you can go there grab the core code

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
get involved in that there's

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,160
loads of cool things to do at

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
libreoffice and we love it

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
um or you can get involved in

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,600
collaboratonline uh on github here

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,000
we have loads of similar easy hacks uh

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
we're more a javascript c plus plus css

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,360
designee

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,560
place and uh we'd love to have you

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
involved there uh

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,079
well you can translate in weblite uh we

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,680
have a forum

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,120
we have weekly public development

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,279
meetings please do show up

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
thursday uh tell us what you like uh

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,360
where you'd like to get involved

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
um and you know our mission really is is

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
to make open source rock

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,160
we like to be focused on office and

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
we're doing

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
we're doing lots of great work with your

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,279
help so thank you

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
thank you for listening i think that's

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,160
all the time i have and as i say really

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,680
looking forward to

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:14,560
seeing people in person when we can

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:14,560
