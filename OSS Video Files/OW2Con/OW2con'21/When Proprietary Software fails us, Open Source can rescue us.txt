Title: When Proprietary Software fails us, Open Source can rescue us
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	In October 2020, Atlassian Plc., the proprietary software editor of Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, Bamboo and other tools, has announced a major change of their product line, moving to be a "Cloud first" company and giving up their "server" historic product line which was the entry point for small teams (in small and large companies) wishing to run their software on-Premise. Since then XWiki SAS, building the XWiki Open Source software competitor to Confluence is receiving many calls for migration. In this talk, I would like to present: - our experience as a provider of an Open Source alternative - analyze the reason why Proprietary software vendors end up progressively moving their customers to the Cloud and/or significantly raising prices - explain why I believe this move is a very dangerous evolution of the software industry, making Open Source as important as ever - share the experience of XWiki SAS on what we are putting in place to allow customers to transition to Open Source - how could our industry avoid such situations by going earlier towards Open Source

uh w2 team um members um

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,960
i'm very happy to be present at the over

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,000
2 con

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,000
2021 online i'm ludovic dubost the ceo

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of xwiki sis

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
i'm here to talk uh about when

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,760
proprietary software fails us

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,800
open source can rescue us um

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,840
who i am i'm uh so the founder

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,320
of uh xwiki which was developing the

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
x-wiki collaboration software

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
uh which is a competitor to to

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,440
conference

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
um all open source uh we also developed

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,360
the

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,160
the crypt product uh which is a

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,199
collaboration platform with encryption

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,719
included

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,719
similar to google docs

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,560
and uh in providing people and allowing

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,720
people to

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
to maintain their privacy everything we

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
do at xwiki is open

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,119
source and we've been for 16 years in

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,400
the open source business

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,040
and today um i'm going to talk about

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,159
uh a case of a typical software cloud

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
business model

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,680
where um in the first phase of the

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
of a strategy of a new software business

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
you start by

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,040
uh collecting customers uh and then we

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
you wait a little bit uh increase your

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
customer base and at some point you

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
you start profiting from that customer

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,799
base but how do you actually do that in

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
in in a lot of cases well you start by

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,439
giving a good price uh

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439
and even a free service um so we know

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
some examples like slack which is going

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
to give you

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
a free community you can use it for free

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,360
or google docs which used to be free for

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
small companies a long time ago you

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
could create

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,160
25 people google uh

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,640
google drive and google apps and and

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
enjoy

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,560
all the applications from google um

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
and uh well you get used to that

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,800
platform

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,319
uh or to that cloud service uh you put a

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
lot of data in that system

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,400
and at some point uh the provider

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
reduces uh the edd free service

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,599
uh first for new customers which are

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,959
going to pay

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,319
uh more but also at some point might

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,160
stop the nice deal

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,160
so completely stop the free service

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,760
force you to move to the paying one

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,200
or just increase it prop progressively

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,319
um and increase the price

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,560
um and so um as a

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,959
as a company that has been following our

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
our competitor atlassian conference

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
so in february atlassian conference has

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,599
decided to actually go even further

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
they decided to move out and stop

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,280
selling a product that they were selling

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
um and so uh if we look at the history

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
i'm not gonna go over all these numbers

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
but you can read the slides if you find

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,519
this interesting

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
um a conference started as a product

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
that was

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
uh unlimited users as many users as you

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
wanted

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,159
it was four thousand dollars and uh

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,920
and actually a couple years later uh

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
if you want ten thousand users on

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
premise it would be two hundred thirty

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,200
thousand dollars

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,560
um and um so if we summarize a bit uh

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,280
in 2005 it was for for a a

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
maximum of four thousand dollars for any

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,319
any number of users and

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,560
in 2021 uh if you want to have an

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,879
on-premise solution it's 20

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,280
27 000 minimal and up to 230 000

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,239
and their cloud service uh also had

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,200
increases

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
it was 700 dollars a month for 500 users

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
and now it's it's

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
three to four times more and we're not

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
talking about

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,640
uh the same product that stays the same

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
price and then they

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,959
add uh they add modules that make you

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
paying no they're actually

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
changing the price of the base model of

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,680
the base

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
product and and if we compare the x-wiki

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
pricing

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
well more or less the x-wiki pricing has

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
not changed a lot and

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
although of course the the product has

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,240
also increased a lot

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
it has been open source and we have a

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
free package we always had a free

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
package

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,240
and uh and it's still open source we do

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
have some paying modules

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
also all open source but they're we're

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
making we're making them pay and they

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,919
come on top of the xwiki platform

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
and our our our entry packages for 500

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,320
users

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,080
are at 2500 euros in 2021 like they were

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
in 2010.

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
uh in our cloud service has also not

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,600
changed price

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,800
uh between 2010 and 2021.

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,800
um so the problem of this is that

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
uh while anybody is allowed to change

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
its pricing the problem is that

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,639
there is also an issue about who's

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,160
controlling our data because

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,639
uh here we also see that um

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,479
that there is a major shift between

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
on-premise and cloud so you had a

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,720
company that was providing a software at

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
four thousand five thousand dollars

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
now the minimum price is twenty seven

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
thousand dollars and they have

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
clearly indicated that their strategy

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
was cloud first

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
and um and it moves everything to the

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
cloud

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,039
um we also see that a lot of startups

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,600
are are only providing cloud services

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,000
now

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,880
not not providing software at all um

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
we can expect that in for for companies

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
that are

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,680
maintaining the the two aspects cloud

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,840
and on-premise there might also be

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
less less features on the on-premise

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,080
versions

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
um and one of the concerns with cloud

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
services is that they

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,199
the cloud services have a high control

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
on the price because if if you're not

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
happy with the price change

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
well it's very difficult for you to get

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
out because you you cannot just wait the

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,680
next upgrade you have to

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,240
get out right away uh if a cloud service

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
stops

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
um you could also have a cloud service

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
that is bought by another one and then

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
it's discontinued completely

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,960
there's a lot of issues with this with

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,759
the proprietary software there

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
and the cloud software in particular and

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,840
now what can open source actually bring

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
to the table well i believe that open

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
source can bring much more trust to the

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
table

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,400
especially using strong licenses um

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,639
strong licenses and open source licenses

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,520
are a contract and they do protect

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
insert in a certain extent the customer

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,160
um

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,400
now uh you you if the

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
if the license is also too permissive

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
then the the open source provider can

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
also decide to move away

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,400
if the software provider is keeping a

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
cla to keep copyright on the whole

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
software

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
then you also have risk that the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,080
software provider moves away

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,120
um but for example if you have agpl and

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,800
no cla

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,880
uh you have a very high uh trust

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
uh that the provider is not gonna change

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,199
its strategy of open sourcing software

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,360
and that's actually quite important open

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
source can also give you freedom between

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,520
cloud and on-premise and the software

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
and and where you use the storefront so

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
you can decide if you

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,199
want to use it on the cloud or if you

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,120
prefer to use it on premise

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,160
and open source can also be much more a

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,440
collaboration where you're not

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
a victim of a decision uh of a of a

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,400
third party

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,240
uh you can also have some some

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
methods to participate uh in making sure

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
that

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,160
uh that the community works and that

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,160
decisions are made together

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
and now what can open source providers

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
do

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,280
in in order to actually uh be more

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
be more available uh for for customers

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
so

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
for example uh we we had we have this

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
case where

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,639
since since february we have more more

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,680
leads that are coming and asking for

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,639
how do i move from from conference to

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
x-wiki

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,199
given the new pricing policy so i think

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
swiki we already had some important

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
tools but

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
we're spending a significant amount of

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
time today

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,199
to propose an offer uh for the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
conference users that uh

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
and develop additional tools to help the

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
migration

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,519
um we believe that this can be of course

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
beneficial for the customers but it can

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
also be

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,920
beneficial for the xwiki community

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
globally because these customers can

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
also sponsor features

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,880
so on our side we're working on a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,839
conference import wizard which is a

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
paying package that we're going to

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,399
propose

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
to customers so that they can move move

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
to xwiki

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,279
and on the other hand we're also

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
discussing with large customers that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
have the capacity to

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
to fund missing open source

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,800
functionalities and macros in particular

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,480
in order to fund the macros that most

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,279
customers need to be able to make the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
moves

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
uh one of the things is that the format

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
of the data that

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
that customers have inside a proprietary

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,040
tool

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
are making migrations very difficult and

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,080
this is actually

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
uh one of the biggest difficulties of

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,519
migration for most customers

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,600
and um uh and so the large customers can

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
really help

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
because they all have the ability uh to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,560
fund the

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,640
uh the features and and then the whole

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
community can benefit from this

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
another aspect i believe that is really

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,080
important is that we

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
as a community open source community we

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
need to explain our differences more to

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
customers and prospect

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
and explain that these type of things

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,160
are predictable

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,920
these these these behaviors of the cloud

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,880
business and proprietary software

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,000
business

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
is part of the book of developing

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,959
companies and uh this is something that

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,519
we need to explain more

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,600
because our our our community can

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,800
provide more trust

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
and one one lesson also

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,399
is that uh open standard is still a

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,240
massive unsolved problem

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
it's really difficult to move data from

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
one system to another

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
there are some initiatives at the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,560
european level to force a bit some

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,200
standards but it's really difficult

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
cloud also represents a huge locking

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
risk uh

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,680
more than proprietary software when you

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
install it in-house

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
today if you have if you have a cloud

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
service

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
well the the cloud service can kick you

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
out in a minute

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,800
um transparency and trust is a major

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,200
issue in the software industry

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,040
uh and this is something that is really

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,959
really difficult to tackle

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,839
um it's it's it's it's a massive

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,959
complexity to

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,720
uh to to provide trust to your customer

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,720
because of course nothing

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
forces you to change your pricing and

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
it's very difficult to guarantee that

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
you won't change your pricing because if

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
if you have a real financial difficulty

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
then you might have to change your

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,399
prices but this is not directed by

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,560
increasing your profit this is directed

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
and abusing your early users

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
this is directed by the fact that you

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
need it to

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,680
uh to to to to provide uh

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
the right solutions to your customers

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
and

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,200
i would say that one of the biggest

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,680
lesson here

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
for many users of of atlassian product

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
is that

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
while moving earlier to open source

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,440
solution is also

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,880
a very good strategy in order to

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,079
to avoid uh feeding a business that is

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,320
going to turn your back

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,880
his back on you um and so uh

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,480
the earlier businesses open source

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
businesses are helped the open source

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
projects are helped developing the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,360
solutions the better they're going to be

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
uh

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,880
and and able to uh to be the only

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
solution that you use

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
thank you very much i hope you

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,360
appreciated this uh

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,639
this uh this conference and i'm i will

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,120
be very happy to

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:24,160
