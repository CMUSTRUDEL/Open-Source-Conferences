Description: 
	In October 2020, Atlassian Plc., the proprietary software editor of Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, Bamboo and other tools, has announced a major change of their product line, moving to be a "Cloud first" company and giving up their "server" historic product line which was the entry point for small teams (in small and large companies) wishing to run their software on-Premise. Since then XWiki SAS, building the XWiki Open Source software competitor to Confluence is receiving many calls for migration. In this talk, I would like to present: - our experience as a provider of an Open Source alternative - analyze the reason why Proprietary software vendors end up progressively moving their customers to the Cloud and/or significantly raising prices - explain why I believe this move is a very dangerous evolution of the software industry, making Open Source as important as ever - share the experience of XWiki SAS on what we are putting in place to allow customers to transition to Open Source - how could our industry avoid such situations by going earlier towards Open Source
