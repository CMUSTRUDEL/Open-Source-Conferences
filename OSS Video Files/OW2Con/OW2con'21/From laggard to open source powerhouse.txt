Title: From laggard to open source powerhouse
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Contributing to open source is finally catching on. It's climbing the Hype Curve, and everyone wants in. Predictably, Open Source Programs Offices are springing up like mushrooms after the rain, and so are job offers for people to run them. And yet, tentatives to join the movement are fraught with disillusion. After an initial honeymoon, the desired outcomes too often fail to materialize. Few employees end up contributing. Communities don't magically coalesce around hastily open sourced internal projects. Hiring pipelines don't overflow with top-notch candidates. And despite what feels like a substantial investment, little value—if any—is captured. There's a reason for that. Building a strong open source culture is transformative. And while grassroots support is key, you don't obtain that kind of outcome without a top-down mandate hinged on a solid business strategy. But because we don't get to see the upstream work involved, we often incorrectly assume there isn't any. As a result, we confuse visible tactics with the underpinning strategy and end-up launching open source programs offices out of fear of missing out. In this talk, we'll look at what happened behind the scenes of companies that successfully transformed their culture to morph into open source powerhouses, and we'll find out how you can do so too.

[Music]

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,920
[Music]

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
well hello everyone

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,279
and welcome to this presentation um from

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
laggard to open source powerhouse so

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,720
this is really talking about the

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
transformative journeys to

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,800
successfully build and strong open

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
source culture and i'm going to take two

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
organizations to talk about this

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,840
microsoft and facebook

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,920
first a bit of context so

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
a lot of people talk about the open

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
source journey

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
one of the examples that i really like

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,800
is nithia ruff's

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,199
example which essentially sees the open

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
source journey as a series of step

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,360
coming from ignoring open source and

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
then consuming it to complying to open

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
source licenses

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
to contributing back and into creating

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,320
in community

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,280
i've slightly amended it to talk about

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,479
culture as a last step right so ignore

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
consume comply

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,479
contribute culture because i think

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
essentially at the heart what's really

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
important what's really

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,119
valuable about open source is culture

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
and

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,960
here is why i'm sure you're all familiar

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,840
with the technology adoption life cycle

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,799
um this is essentially um a way of

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
dividing

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,119
um community a pool of adopters um

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
into five sections first innovators are

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,400
the first ones to

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,159
really start using your products then

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
you have the early adopters

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,000
the early majority the late majority and

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,159
the laggards

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
a lot of companies today are still

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
laggards in the open source space

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
and believe this conversation is about

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,960
how you move from being a laggard

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,399
to being an innovator in that space

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,640
um it's interesting to sort of map

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,960
this the technology adoption cycle

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759
to the different the five different

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
steps

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,959
of the open source journey that we

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
talked about earlier

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,120
and so if we look at consuming which is

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
the second step after essentially

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,840
ignoring open source

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,920
we realized that even in um

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,200
um specific verticals that

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,520
like financial services everyone

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
consumes open source right it's

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,400
literally a hundred percent

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,040
and this um dates from a 29 report

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
but this is uh this was this is

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
increasingly i mean increasingly if you

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
can

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,599
be more than 100 essentially open source

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,280
is ubiquitous it's

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,879
everywhere so if we move up those stairs

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
and look at compliance

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
um the way i look at compliance is sort

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
of

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
a bit sideways to look at well you have

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
to comply if you're using open source

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
and products

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,040
and so let's look at that because we

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,080
have data around this right

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,319
and so um this is an open source

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
um it's the open source programs in the

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,720
enterprise 2019 survey

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
which essentially shows that again for

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,080
financial services but this is

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
sort of like broadly true across the

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,959
spectrum of verticals

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,480
um open source is

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:27,040
used in about three quarters

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,040
of um shipped software

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,799
um and really regularly for

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,040
50 58 right so we're really sort of like

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
in the early majority late majority

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,599
space at this point

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
contributing falls down if you look at

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,760
financial services

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
um we're really talking about between 10

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,400
and 20 percent

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,959
it's higher in tech where we're close to

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
like well

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
sorry not even close we're over um half

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
of companies contributing back on a

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
regular basis

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
and we unfortunately don't have a lot of

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
data about

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,599
companies adopting open source culture

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
though a lot of the most advanced

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,480
practices around devops

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,560
inner source etc are actually building

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
on this

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
so why would you want to build a strong

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,600
open source culture

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,959
well essentially because this is where

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,880
the value is right

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,880
everyone is doing the rust already at

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
least everyone is using open source

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,919
three-quarters of um consumers of open

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
source are actually shipping in products

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,240
and complying to license requirements as

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,880
a result

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
um increasingly people are contributing

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
back

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
companies are contributing back we're

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,080
talking about 50 of type companies

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
um maybe a quarter to a third of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
companies and

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,479
other verticals um and so really if you

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
want to be

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,600
at innovating uh um

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
building a strong open source culture is

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
where the value is and unsurprisingly

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,840
tech companies in particular large tech

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,280
companies have really understood this

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,080
and are leveraging it so the question

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
then is

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,960
um well actually how do you build a

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
strong open source culture how do you

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,039
move from being a laggard in the space

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
to being an innovator to being an open

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
source powerhouse

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,960
for this we'll look at two corporations

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
that really did an incredible u-turn

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
um over the course of the last decade

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,039
and the first one is

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
facebook so when i joined facebook in

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
2010 it was

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
perceived by the community as a source

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,759
graveyard

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,360
this is where um projects open source

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,960
projects went to die

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
as open as um facebook hired open source

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
maintainers to come

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,639
work on its property products which

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,880
isn't to say that um facebook

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,880
hadn't um focused on open source in the

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
past not only by releasing cassandra in

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,639
right um so in 2012

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
a friend of mine who was a long time up

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
to his contributor

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
started asking internally are facebook

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
engineers still contributing to open

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
source

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,600
and isn't this a problem if they're not

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
right

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,840
and this led to

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
building um to really refocusing the

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,600
organization on open source

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
led to them um launch the announcement

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
of react

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,319
uh to the well start of building react

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,680
in 2013

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,680
and then um the announcement and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,520
uh react getting traction in 2014

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,960
um and later on a keynote at austin

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,440
in 2015 uh where

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
uh james pierce my manager when it was

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
at facebook

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,680
really started talking about the

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,039
benefits of open source

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,960
for the company and how they had

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,360
leveraged uh open source

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,600
um from for a number of different uh

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
business benefits

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
so here if you sort of like see the

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,599
visibility of open source

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
sort of dipping dipping dipping until we

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,759
leave this react launch

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,039
and then sort of climb from there and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
the value to the company sort of

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,840
followed

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,800
was a bit of a delay because react had

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,720
really

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,720
a rough start right but ended up really

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
transforming the public perception of

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
the company

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
um as ali byron who is a software

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
engineer

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,360
next ex-facebook software engineer said

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,759
in a podcast

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,840
react was having this outsized impact on

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,800
facebook's ability to attract and retain

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,479
great talent and to establish itself as

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
a well-known brand in software

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,960
engineering

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,720
and uh what's interesting is that

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,599
informed

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
their further practice of open source

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,560
which is

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,680
uh they saw the success the success that

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
they were having was

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
a react and so they started looking for

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
other projects and

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,680
made sure to find overlap

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,199
between internal benefits

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,360
so business benefits for the

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,800
organization and community priorities

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,960
so let's now have a look at microsoft

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,759
so microsoft has a really rough start

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,919
with

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,759
open source right all the way back to

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
linux as a cancer and the famous quote

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,400
from steve ballmer

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,160
right and it took a lot of time for

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,599
um microsoft to move beyond that initial

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,039
phase um in 2012 the added next to

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,599
uh the azir uh cloud solution

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,759
um and um that really started

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,720
accelerating when satya nandella became

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,279
ceo

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,240
um satya really talked a lot about

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,159
uh desaloing the company and really

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
leveraged the concepts of open source to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,599
help with this

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
so he famously said i tell my colleagues

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,880
they could

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,320
get to own a customer scenario not to

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,600
code so really

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,839
microsoft embraced inner source

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
and i you know this was really

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,760
noticeable from 2015 onwards

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
i started seeing a lot of friends from

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
the open source community in the web

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,959
community joining microsoft which

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
uh you know like a decade earlier would

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,880
have been impossible right because

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,519
microsoft had such a bad rep

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720
among open source practitioners um and

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,440
in 2016

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
um um microsoft joined the linux

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
foundation

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,680
then then acquired github joined

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,480
hawaiian

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,080
um etc etc right and and now like

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
everyone sees

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
microsoft as this huge open source

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
powerhouse and so in terms of visibility

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
you really see them

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,959
this increase in visibility that is

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
aligned with an increased value to the

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,720
company

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
where um today it's essentially one of

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,800
the strongest proponents of

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
open source um uh out there among the

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,839
large tech companies

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
so to quickly recap um if you want to

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
build

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,839
a strong open source culture you need

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
grassroots support this is what happened

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
at facebook

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
you need one or multiple change agents

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
um facebook

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,000
part of it was the spread of mind

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
driving this effort and really

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,519
carrying this conversation internally

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,200
and you need to

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,040
have management support and executive

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
buy-in this can come

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,839
up front or this can be built in um so

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
at microsoft really this was a top-down

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,360
effort

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
and at facebook this was sort of like

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,600
the the buy-in

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,320
came as executives soared saw the

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
benefits

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
firsthand of um really building that

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
that culture

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,240
and of course you need lots of time you

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,800
know in both of these cases this took

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
close uh multiple years uh close to a

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,680
decade when you look at

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,920
microsoft right and so an ospo

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
can be there um so an open source

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,519
programs office can be there in support

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,160
of this work like it was a facebook

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,120
or can be the change agent as it was at

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
microsoft

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,240
under the direction of the executive

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
right

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
and as i mentioned change can be top

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
down or bottom up

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
in either case what's really really

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
important is to

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,720
consider um making the effort

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,480
sustainable because if you don't

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,000
um then what happens is it's a fad and a

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,360
number of years down the road

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,440
as soon as other goals other focus

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
shows up people start forgetting about

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
it so you really want

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,040
alignment to his company goals um at

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
microsoft it was really about breaking

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,240
internal silos

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
and that facebook it was really about

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
the company's image and driving

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,519
recruiting

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
so you really have to find these um key

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,600
goals

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,600
of what your strategy wants to focus on

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,880
and drive

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,120
um lastly i really want to

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
underline that you know we talk a lot

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
about the open source journey but in

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
fact really it's a practice

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
and i want to close with sachin nando's

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,240
words that i think are

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,160
really meaningful here about has effort

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,519
of changing microsoft and he says the

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
following

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
because i've made culture change at

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
microsoft

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,800
such a high priority people often ask

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
how it's going

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
well i suppose my response is very

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
eastern

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
we're making great progress but we

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
should never be done

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,200
it's not a program was a start and an

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,079
end

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
it's a way of being i think that's the

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,079
key takeaway

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
really from this express presentation is

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,440
that

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,200
building culture is um

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,440
changing who you are as an organization

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
and embracing open source is really

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,480
something that you transform into

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,079
and then become um and and that informs

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
a lot of the way you build software and

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,240
not of the way

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,560
you react as an organization and that's

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,519
it

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
thank you very much um for um your

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,519
attention

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:52,240
and i'm glad to discuss this um

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:54,320
in the chat some more thank you so much

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
