Description: 
	When your documents processing and storage is carried out in private or public cloud environments, data breaches and other security issues can expose them to the outside world. A possible and yet the only solution is client-side protection of the information itself, which is the data transfer in online editing, including collaboration between multiple users. We provide a comprehensive range of security tools and services, keeping your data safe on all fronts. ONLYOFFICE is self-hosted which makes it secure by design. Its source code is open and available for everyone to examine and test it. Document access is protected in many ways including JWT, flexible document permissions (view, edit, comment only, review, fill forms, and custom filter for spreadsheets), watermark, copy, print and download protection. We use different methods of encryption in ONLYOFFICE solutions - you can encrypt your whole workspace at rest, your data in transfer is always encrypted with HTTPS. And most importantly you can encrypt documents end-to-end with the new functionality called Private Rooms. Private Rooms are protected workplaces where every symbol you type is encrypted using the unbreakable AES-256 algorithm, even if you are co-editing documents with your teammates in real-time.
