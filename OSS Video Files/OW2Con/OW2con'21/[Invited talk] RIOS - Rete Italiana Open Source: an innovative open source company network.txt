bringing open source solution to the

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,240
enterprise market

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,400
is the aim of rios hi everybody i'm

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,439
stefano pampaloni vice president of

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,359
rios and today i want to tell you the

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,880
reason behind rios and what we are doing

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,840
but first of all i'll tell you

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,120
who we are because i think uh you you

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
don't know

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,719
uh us rios is a legal entity

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,920
currently made up of nine companies

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
they have different sizes and business

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
models

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,960
but they have

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
two strong common factors one is the

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,440
high

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,799
i.t expertise and of course

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
we have all a common ground on open

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
source

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,240
of course we were born six years ago

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,159
but it's been a couple of years

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,720
that we have had a big push

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
we spent a lot of time to find the right

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,280
way to work

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,240
together and today we really act as a

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,720
single company this is the key point of

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
my presentation the message i like to

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
transmit

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
we do business together we lead the open

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
source to

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,479
business critical context we want to

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,119
to link open source and business

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
in a sustainable way this is the main

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
goal for

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,520
rios every single company is still

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,880
autonomous

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,399
but we have a common name

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,000
here a picture of rios through some

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,520
key numbers please mind the last row

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
because it has been

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
a great achievement for us and it's a

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,680
key service

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,160
of course food for the enterprise market

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
however the other numbers are are quite

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
important

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,800
we are more than 400

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,599
uh employees and we have an aggregator

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,520
revenue

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,640
of more than 20 million euros

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,920
okay let me uh deeply explain why

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,120
uh rios we open source

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,920
is our choice of course and maybe for

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
most of you

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
uh it's a it's a common choice

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
um we choose open source for many

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,239
reasons

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,560
for article one to avoid uh looking

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,160
for many other reasons you name it

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,720
but is it still enough uh

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
for the enterprise or for large

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,360
government entities

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,000
well uh we think uh those are still good

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
reasons

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
but the market asked for uh something

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
more

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,480
first of all the market

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,519
has asked to provide real and trusted uh

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,879
competencies uh in the enterprise

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,480
market it's usually difficult for many

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,800
companies to understand

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,480
if an open source product is really good

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,200
if it will be supported for long term

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
if the partner has the right skills it's

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,760
important to

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,120
take out those dubst moreover

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,720
uh there is another another question

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,680
who can do who can build and maintain

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,040
the integration between the integrations

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
be between

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,560
many open source components

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,879
in business it's important to have a

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,400
regulatory compliance solution

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,720
for example so we must guarantee about

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
the the integration of many different

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,640
components

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
we guarantee competencies through

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,959
specification

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,400
and requirements we

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,680
we ask to our companies

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
and thanks to the high expertise on many

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,919
components

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,680
we can develop and support integrated

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
solutions

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
let me explain how we are doing this how

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,280
we work

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,479
together we we are as rios as a

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
a small management team uh we are just

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,280
three in the management team

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,880
um because the core value of the network

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,080
uh are the the working groups

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
uh however we use uh many different

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,320
tools like

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,639
gitlab and and file sharing uh

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
systems to to share information and to

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,759
work together

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,840
we started uh with slack but now we are

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,000
moving to rocket chat

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,520
to for quick communication to chat

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,520
and this is an important tool to

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,759
create engagement for our employees

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
across the companies the different

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,240
companies

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
the the working groups they are working

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,720
like

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,120
department of of a company to create

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,400
a virtual a single company

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,360
although of all the other uh

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,440
companies from all the other companies

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,520
let me show some result of these

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,800
uh of this organic organization

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,919
for example the marketing team uh is is

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,440
is really amazing uh it organizes more

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,120
monthly webinars uh media campaigns

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
uh third-party events and the last in

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
the last december

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
a great event it has organized a great

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
event

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:04,319
with more than 80 talks many workshops

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,759
and more than uh 1200

attendees it has been a huge results uh

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,520
for results for us of course

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
the offering group the offering team

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,039
has defined the portfolio and is

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
constantly checking

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,840
the quality of the delivery here is the

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,319
the portfolio

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
for these products we have certified

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,199
engineers

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,639
we we required to have to our companies

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,160
to have certified engineers um

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,520
community contributors and for most of

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
these products we provide even training

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,319
courses

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,080
in italy i think there is no us

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,280
other so wide offering with this

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,120
level of competencies of course

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,479
the tech group

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
is responsible to to manage common tools

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,560
to work together of course uh it

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,319
builds it builds uh integrated solution

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,840
uh and has organized that the

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,479
24 7 support that's it's needed

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,919
to the enterprise market but of course

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
was really difficult

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:25,280
uh uh to to be provided

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,080
from our single uh companies together

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800
of course we can do it and the community

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,319
group

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,599
is definitely our effort to contribute

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,680
back to open source and to adopt

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
the openness value across all the

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,240
companies

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,599
we encourage our employees to join

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,360
communities and some of them

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,479
are community measure managers the sales

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,680
working group is actually just a

00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,080
coordinating activities to avoid the

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,599
conflicts and to let this sales account

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,720
let the entire rios offering

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,120
to the market the partnership

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,400
working group is very important because

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,440
we have a program to get

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,080
new companies in the network

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,599
and to work together with similar uh

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,479
with other entities

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,520
we recently added new companies in in

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,199
the network

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,879
to expand our uh our activities

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
and we signed the collaboration

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,919
agreement with national

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,159
and international entities uh o.w.2

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:43,279
is is a great example of these

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,040
of this partnership and we know that

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,160
we have a lot to learn from other

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
other entities uh in italy and outside

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
italy

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
the legal uh um let me see the legal

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,640
department

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,760
the legal working group is

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,519
is addressing the legal uh issue the

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,600
internal legal issue

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,320
for for the network but it's even

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
building up a service for the customers

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,279
for the market

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,800
to help them uh to check the legal

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,480
compliance of the licenses as well as

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,519
the business strategies for

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,959
open source adoption the

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:31,279
the recent changes in the

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,959
elastic search licenses

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
has been one of the

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
task of the of the legal uh working

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,120
group

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
for example together with the the

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,920
community group

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,279
the community working group the legal

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,800
uh group is is thinking about

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
offering us something like an ospo as a

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
service

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
an open source program office as a

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,440
service

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,880
for those companies

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,959
not so big to have an internal hospital

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,240
we are thinking about helping them

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,440
to manage the the open source governance

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,279
few few words about our customers

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,800
