Title: Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the Public Sector
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	OSORâ€™s (European Open Source Observatory) Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the Public Sector offer practical tips for civil servants at all administrative levels, project managers, IT developers, and open source software (OSS) enthusiasts looking to engage with OSS. The purpose of the Guidelines is to act as a practical tool that can be used by public sector officials interested in establishing or joining open source communities or by members of such communities. Building on the belief that OSS projects are sustainable when there are healthy communities surrounding them, the Guidelines focus on three key topics: setting a sustainable foundation to engage with OSS in the public sector, joining an existing OSS community, and setting up a new public sector OSS community from scratch. The production of the Guidelines entailed multiple steps: an academic literature review, a community survey and development of five case studies looking at successful OSS communities. It was key to develop Guidelines that would be deemed meaningful for their target audience. We have discovered that there are five key success factors that contribute to the sustainability of open source communities in the public sector: software maturity, sustainable finance, community vibrancy, community governance, and public sector adoption incentives. The Guidelines build on each of these factors and further explore them. The Guidelines were produced in close collaboration with public sector open source community members and published by the European Commission Open Source Observatory (OSOR). Available since November 2020, the Guidelines are also currently open to further feedback from the community as well as testimonies on their application.

[Music]

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
good afternoon everyone and thank you

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
for joining us in this session on the

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
guidelines for sustainable open source

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
communities in the public sector

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,800
my name is vivian and today i'll be

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
joined by my colleague barbour

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
we are both members of the european

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,920
commission's open source observatory

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,160
also known as ozor the focus of today's

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
presentation is on the sustainability of

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
open source communities in the public

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
sector

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,879
we believe that only by fostering

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
sustainable open source communities

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
can we build a european open source

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
ecosystem

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
more specifically we will talk about

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
ozora's guidelines for sustainable open

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
source communities

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,079
and deep dive into some examples of such

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
communities that were either launched by

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
or joined by the public sector and the

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,960
factors behind their success

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,680
before we start allow us to tell you a

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
little bit about

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,600
uzor since 2007 ozark has brought public

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
administrations and open source

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,200
communities together

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
by offering a single access point for

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
information

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
that aims to foster the use of open

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
source within the public sector

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
ozor is hosted on the join up

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
collaborative platform

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,799
and its code is open and accessible to

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
everyone

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
we also share guidelines best practices

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
and other useful resources that we will

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
talk about shortly

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
finally ozar nurtures an active

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,040
community by bringing users together

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,840
through regular webinars and workshops

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
here is a screenshot of ozor's page as

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
you can see

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,280
the content on azure is quite varied it

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
includes news on the latest developments

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
in open source in the public sector

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,280
we have longer case studies with

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
insights about good practices

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,840
interesting projects and much more

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
you'll also find event listings for open

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,719
source focused events in europe

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
including the ones organized by us all

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
of this information is not just

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
published by uzor

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
any community member can contribute and

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,759
all you have to do is create a join up

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,760
account

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
a key resource i haven't touched on yet

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,599
is the knowledge center

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,440
which gives users access to a variety of

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,319
resources in addition to these i

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,400
mentioned

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
first there is the country intelligence

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
on open source policies in and beyond

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
europe

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
and so far we have published reports

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
outlining the status of open source

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,760
policies in about 30 countries

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
there are also case studies on the use

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
of oss in public administrations

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
and one other unique resource is the

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
list of open source

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
associations competence centers and

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
points of contact in each eu member

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
states

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,120
if you're here for code we also have a

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
list of oss repositories that are

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,959
relevant for

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,800
or created by the public sector finally

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
there are our guidelines for creating

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
sustainable open source communities in

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
the public sector

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,400
which are the topic for today's

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
presentation i will now hand you over to

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,159
barbora

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,519
who will tell you more about them thank

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,959
you vivian

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
it is well known that public

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
administration stand to gain from the

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,560
use of open source software

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
however despite the benefits of using

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
open source software we observe a

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
somewhat scattered landscape of its

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
adoption

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,879
across public administrations in europe

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
additionally our team firmly believes

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,080
that the adoption of open source can

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,519
only be sustainable if there are

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,519
communities around it

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
in other words public administration

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
should not be mere consumers of the

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
software

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,400
but rather active contributors to it

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
motivated by these observations we

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
decided to investigate what makes open

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
source communities in the public sector

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
sustainable

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
and then created practical guidelines

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
with these findings for zore users

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
in the guidelines you will find

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,959
recommendations best practices and

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
resources for anyone looking to adopt

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,000
and create open source software in the

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
public sector

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
thanks to the e-translation tool that

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,519
was integrated into join up you can

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
auto-translate the guidelines into more

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,239
than 24 languages

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
we took a multi-step approach to produce

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,159
the guidelines the first step was to

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,560
identify the key success factors that

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,799
contribute to community sustainability

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
then we identify sustainable communities

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,959
in order to learn from them

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
and their successful experiences we also

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,680
relied on collaboration with our azure

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,040
community

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,799
we launched a survey to better

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
understand the sustainability of public

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,720
sector communities and developed five

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
case studies looking at communities in

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
italy

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
finland the netherlands fan and germany

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
we organized an in-person workshop in

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
pre-pandemic times and held a webinar to

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
gather user feedback

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
you can find more information on our

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,880
approach and our literature review and

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
survey findings

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
in the dedicated publication available

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
on azure

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
the resulting guidelines are structured

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,600
into three chapters

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
they begin by detailing how public

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
administrations can lay a solid

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
foundation

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,320
to sustainably engage with open source

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
they also provide recommendations on how

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,360
public administrations can join an

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
existing community

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
or build their own from scratch

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
one of the goals of producing these

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
guidelines was to help public

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
administrations and open source

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
communities collaborating with them

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,360
to understand what the main factors

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,240
contributing to community sustainability

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
are to this end we identify five key

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,280
sustainability factors

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
these are community vibrancy

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
it relates to members motivation and the

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,520
community's capacity to retain current

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,120
members and attract new ones

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
open source communities should provide

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,199
opportunities for growth

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
sustainable funding relates to funding

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,080
and resource management within the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,160
community

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
clear governance structure relates to

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
the presence of transparent processes

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and procedures within the community

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759
technological maturity

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
relates to the quality of the software

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,639
source code and its documentation

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
last but not least public sector

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,600
adoption incentives

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
release the nuances of public

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
administrations this includes the

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,120
importance of having support of the

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,039
political and managerial hierarchy

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,960
raising awareness of open source and

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
being open to change

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,319
the recommendations shared in the

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
guidelines built on each of these

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
factors

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
we will deep dive into what each of

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,080
these factors mean in practice

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
shortly having explained the key

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
sustainability factors

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
we would like to highlight how they are

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
reflected in practice

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
we will take a closer look at five

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
different communities and highlight a

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
sustainability factor

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
in each and what it means for the

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,880
community

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
launched in 2009 by the finnish national

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,000
land survey

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
oskari is an open source software

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,880
framework that can be used to easily

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
build web mapping applications showcase

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,120
geospatial data

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
and further analyze it thanks to oskari

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,199
public administrations and other

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,199
organizations that use the software

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
can share their spatial data and work

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
collaboratively

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,759
today approximately 40 organizations are

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
involved in oskari's development

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
although the project originated within

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
the public sector

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,960
the solution is now used in several

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
public and private organizations in

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,360
finland and abroad

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
to support geospatial projects many

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
factors contribute to oscar's

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
sustainability

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
however we would like to highlight its

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
sustainable funding

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,639
the initial budget for the project came

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,639
from the finnish ministry of agriculture

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,960
once the other public administrations

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,720
became interested in using oskari

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
the project team set up a joint

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
development forum

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
which has a say in the development of

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,680
oskari

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,240
each interested member signs a contract

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
and contributes a yearly fee set at 5

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
000 euros

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
in our guidelines we offer several

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,240
recommendations on how to secure

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,400
sustainable funding for one's community

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
organizations should calculate the total

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
cost of ownership of their project to

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,199
have a clear idea of the required

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,599
budgets

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,000
secure funding either public or private

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
for the entire project evolution

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,280
and assess if they might need any

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,960
additional resources down the line

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,720
let's now turn to the importance of

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,000
having a clear governance structure in

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
your community

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
launched by the city of paris in 2001 le

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
test is a free and open source portal

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
engine that allows users to quickly

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,879
create a website or a web application

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
part operating system and part content

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,240
management system the source code helps

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
users to easily create

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
and maintain custom websites and

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,360
applications which can then be further

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
enhanced with additional functional

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
modules

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
as a project launched by the public

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
sector the software the test is

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,960
maintained and developed within the

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
municipal government of paris

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,360
to ensure it can operate smoothly the

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,959
100-member community has established a

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,880
clear governance structure

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,159
with well-defined roles established for

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,919
each contributor

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
inspiring leaders help to steer the

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,919
daily work of their community

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,440
azor's guidelines recommend for any

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
community to establish a clear

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
decision-making structure in the

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,760
community

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,600
with defined roles and responsibilities

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
and to produce easily accessible

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
guidelines

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,560
a community should have a core team

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
consisting of members who make regular

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
contributions to the software

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
interact with the broader community and

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
are responsible for making key project

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,880
decisions

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,640
looking at technological maturity we

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,680
want to highlight the community of

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,000
integrate launched by students integrate

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,399
is an open source digital integration

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,399
platform designed to reduce information

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,880
poverty for new arrivals in

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,360
and within germany today it has helped

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,519
over 60 german municipalities

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
each of which now are community members

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
of integrate

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
as a testament to its sustainability the

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,560
community also hopes to launch

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
internationally

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,839
the integrate software is

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,959
technologically mature and well

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,600
documented

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
a designated team updates the software

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
conducts peer reviews

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,920
and follows up on any bug reports they

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
ensure that integrate is up to date

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
responsive to the community's needs and

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
digitally relevant the team behind

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,720
integrate believes that the mature and

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,519
user-friendly packaging of their

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
software

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,839
is one of the key factors explaining

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,000
their success in rapid growth

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,920
in the guidelines you will find multiple

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
recommendations to take into account

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
when it comes to maintaining your

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
software

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
it is important to plan regular updates

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
and new releases

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
and to provide up-to-date and

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
high-quality documentation

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,720
the technical maturity of software is

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
crucial for the community sustainability

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
as it is the foundation on which it is

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
built

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
next let's take a closer look at the

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,760
role that community vibrancy place on

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,800
sustainability and how this can be

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,440
achieved

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,200
in 2019 the city of groningen decided to

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,279
launch a participatory democracy

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,360
platform titled the voice of groningen

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,279
the municipality chose to create a fork

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
of the console software which offers an

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
open source digital platform

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
and an app for participatory democracy

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
well verse of warning

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
is an independent public sector led

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
initiative in its own right

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,760
they began to contribute to the existing

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
open source community that had already

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
been built

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
around the console software not just the

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
work that they had developed

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
one of the key factors behind the

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
sustainability of both voice of grinding

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,040
and

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,160
end console is the community vibrancy

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,079
members of the core

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
team of voice of groningen indicated

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,519
that they chose console as it was a

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
well-documented solution

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
with a strong and supportive community

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,040
of developers behind it

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,880
another testament to the sustainability

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
of console is that whilst the software

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,200
has been worked

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
more than 550 times a lot of communities

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
contribute upstream

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
and share their software updates with

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
console our guidelines

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
emphasize the importance of a common

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,600
sense of purpose in the community as a

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,120
way to ensure members commitment

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
as is the case for the voice of

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,480
groningen and council communities

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
entering members motivation is key for

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,279
long-term communities sustainability and

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
growth

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,399
the three main ways to do this is to

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
recognize your members work

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,560
and through transparent decision-making

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,800
processes and organize regular meetups

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,360
the final sustainability factor is

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,639
public sector adoption incentives

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,279
we will analyze it through the

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,440
perspective of the developers italia

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,959
a public sector launch community of

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
software developers

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,040
and the central open source software

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,600
platform designed for the delivery of

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,839
digital public services in italy

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
the founders of developers italia had a

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
good understanding of both public sector

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
processes

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,880
and the nature of open source

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
communities for this reason

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,959
the core team invested significant

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
resources in educating their public

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,120
sector peers are about the horizontal

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
and collaborative nature of oss

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
projects inviting them to regular

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
community meetings and showcasing

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
community achievements

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,079
similarly despite some hesitations

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
community

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,320
managers insisted that everyone should

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
work together on a common platform as a

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
way to break silos

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,320
and ensure transparent decision making

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,720
in our guidelines we recommend building

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
relationships outside your community

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
to help you boost its recognition within

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
your public administration

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
contribution and resources dedicated to

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
your open source community

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
have to be recognized and valued by the

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,800
management and employees

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399
this can only happen if other civil

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,079
servants outside the community

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,480
understand what working on an

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,720
open source solution entails such as the

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
horizontal and communal nature of open

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
source projects

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
all of the communities analyzed in our

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,959
case studies demonstrated flexibility

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,639
and agility to work with and within

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,720
public administrations

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,720
and often opted to increase the number

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,440
of actors involved to strengthen their

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,200
sustainability

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,519
we hope that the presentation of these

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,680
five sustainable communities

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
and an explanation of how their success

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
factors are linked to recommendations in

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
our guidelines shed light on how public

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
administrations can build sustainable

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
open source ecosystems

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,600
the recommendations we presented are

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
just a snapshot of what is available in

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
the guidelines

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
in there you will find many more

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,399
practical recommendations

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,920
tips and resources before we close our

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,680
presentation we would like to let you

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,880
know that guidelines are currently open

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,720
for feedback

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
we are keen to hear from our community

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,440
about how they could be further improved

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
in order to meet your needs so go ahead

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
have a read

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,399
and if you feel like you might have

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
something to share let us know
