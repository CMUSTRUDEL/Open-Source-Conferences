Description: 
	OSORâ€™s (European Open Source Observatory) Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the Public Sector offer practical tips for civil servants at all administrative levels, project managers, IT developers, and open source software (OSS) enthusiasts looking to engage with OSS. The purpose of the Guidelines is to act as a practical tool that can be used by public sector officials interested in establishing or joining open source communities or by members of such communities. Building on the belief that OSS projects are sustainable when there are healthy communities surrounding them, the Guidelines focus on three key topics: setting a sustainable foundation to engage with OSS in the public sector, joining an existing OSS community, and setting up a new public sector OSS community from scratch. The production of the Guidelines entailed multiple steps: an academic literature review, a community survey and development of five case studies looking at successful OSS communities. It was key to develop Guidelines that would be deemed meaningful for their target audience. We have discovered that there are five key success factors that contribute to the sustainability of open source communities in the public sector: software maturity, sustainable finance, community vibrancy, community governance, and public sector adoption incentives. The Guidelines build on each of these factors and further explore them. The Guidelines were produced in close collaboration with public sector open source community members and published by the European Commission Open Source Observatory (OSOR). Available since November 2020, the Guidelines are also currently open to further feedback from the community as well as testimonies on their application.
