Title: How public policies can contribute to the sustainability of the European open source ecosystem
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	APELL is a federation of national open source business associations in Europe, founded in 2020, in order to increase opportunities for the members of the Association’s member organisations (i.e. European business), and to increase value and advancement for the ultimate customers in both the public and the private sectors. APELL acts as a network for the exchange of best practices between its national member associations, as a think tank on national and European public policies concerning Free Software, and as an interlocutor for the European institutions concerned by these policies. For APELL, European digital sovereignty, claimed by the highest leaders of the Union, requires the development of the European F/OSS industry and the ecosystems that surround it. Public procurement rules, support for collaborative R&D, but also the creation and respect of rules (interoperability, respect of human rights...) allowing European companies to remain or become competitive, are part of the instruments that Europe must put in place for this. Since the publication of the European open source strategy in 2019, and in particular the creation of an European OSPO, APELL and its national member associations have been working to ensure that F/OSS and open standards remain at the heart of the main European initiatives on these subjects (e.g. Digital Markets Act, Data Act, OSPOs everywhere, Bothorel Report in France, GAIA-X, etc.). APELL and its member associations also intend to play an active role in promoting European F/OSS companies, as well as F/OSS projects and products of European origin. This presentation will be an opportunity to take stock of: - The European political and economic context around F/OSS, both at the EU and Member State level - APELL's values, objectives and current actions in relation to this context.

[Music]

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,480
good morning i'm stefan femigh and i

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
would like today to talk about

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,400
public policies how they can contribute

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
to the sustainability of the european

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,039
open source ecosystem

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,359
and why they should i'm a co-founder

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
and board member of appel an association

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
that was founded last year

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,960
its members are european industry

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,879
association

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,160
currently six countries are represented

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,879
five in the eu plus the united kingdom

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,920
and there is another additional member

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,680
open from europe

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,360
the current context in the eu is that

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
there are many studies that show that

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
free and open source software

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,440
can be seen as an engine for economic

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,359
growth and job creation

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
there is also an ongoing debate on

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
digital sovereignty and we strongly

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,119
believe

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,439
that free and open source software can

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
play a huge part in this uh

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
this domain and then i will try to

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,840
discuss some existing policies

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,960
before discussing some additional

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,600
ones first

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
the open source market in europe is

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
already quite big

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
in france it's more than 5 billion

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
euros per year same in germany same in

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,960
the uk

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,200
and for the rest of europe it's like

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,119
it's about 10 billion euros per year

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
there were many economic studies the

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,280
most recent one which is uh

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
not yet published but some preliminary

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,000
results have been uh

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
discussed already is that uh free and

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
open source software

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,920
um contribute a lot to the

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,439
european economy um

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
since we want to discuss digital

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,920
sovereignty we need a definition and

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,640
i'm using the one that's provided by the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,439
french ministry of defense

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,879
in this context digital sovereignty is

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,760
defined as a strategic

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,440
autonomy it doesn't mean that a country

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,840
or the european union should

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
try to do everything internally but it

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
should always try to preserve an

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,920
autonomous capacity for assessment

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,360
decision and action in a digital space

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
according to the commission to last

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
year's plan on

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
open source that was published by the

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,840
commission the open source model

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,840
will have an impact on europe's digital

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
autonomy

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,400
and this year with cnlll the french

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
national association of open source

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
businesses

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,959
we did a large survey of our members

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,879
and more than 90 percent of these

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,160
company leaders believe that digital

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
sovereignty is a

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,440
very important priority for both

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
economic

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,640
and the democratic future of france and

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
europe

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,159
but only one third of the respondents

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
believe that france is

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
implementing right now the right open

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
source industrial strategy to regain

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,879
digital sovereignty

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,800
almost 90 of the respondents believe

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
that the key principles of open source

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
can help preserve the digital

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
sovereignty

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,560
of france and europe

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
and according to the same study digital

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
sovereignty can be a driver for new

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
businesses

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,319
you have the figures on the slide new

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
customers

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
that recognize that open source is an

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
important factor

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,599
for sovereignty but

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,159
it's still a bit hard to explain and so

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,560
our opinion is that the european union

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
the member states and the regions must

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
all define and implement

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
open source industrial strategies so now

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
a sample of existing policies across the

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,840
eu

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,040
most important document at this point is

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
the

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
communication by the european commission

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
that was launched

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,680
last year and which aim to develop

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,560
software solution

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
and take into account the openness

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
sharing and reused

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
that are specific to open source but

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
after reading carefully

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
the communication there are a lot a lot

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
of very interesting points

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
but what we found lacking is that there

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,440
is absolutely no mention

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,720
of a real economic policy

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
that would underline this open source

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,440
strategy

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,040
for for europe in france

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
there have been some open source

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,800
strategies for at least

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
10 years one of the most important

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,880
first occurrences were the circular

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
error in 2012

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
that would argue to the proper use of

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
free software

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,040
in the public administration the main

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,759
arguments that were considered at the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
time

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
where only tactical considerations lower

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
cost

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,600
flexibility negotiation leverage with

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
software render

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
but no mention of strategic autonomy or

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
similar concept

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:16,160
the republic numeric um four years later

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,440
was a huge step forward um

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,400
because the the the the world

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,960
control durability and independence of

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,080
the public services administration

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,360
systems

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,280
is written in the in the law

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
and independence as we've already

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
discussed is almost

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
are very closely related to digital

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,199
serving team

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,720
and the most important point for the

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,280
the open source uh community is that

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
this law says that the public

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
administration should encourage the use

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
of free software

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,960
and open standards

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,759
more recently uh a new circular by uh

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,680
prime minister jean-claude in april uh

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,199
created

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,720
a new um a new team in

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
in the administration called mission

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,600
legislative

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,400
which is quite related to the the

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,639
concept of

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,600
open source program office with a

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,759
three-pronged action plan plan

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
to help the public administration

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
publish its

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
own source code under open source

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
licenses

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,199
to make better use of open source

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,479
software and administration

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,319
and to use open source to make the

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,840
administration more attractive

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,440
to uh digital talent but what's lacking

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,520
for this three-part plan is once again

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,319
an economic policy let's look a bit at

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,960
germany quite recently a center for

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,120
digital sovereignty was uh established

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,400
within the public administration and

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
it's quite clear that

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,960
the initial mission for this center is

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,840
the promotion of a console software in

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
the public administration so this is the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,680
strongest argument

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,840
that we've seen so far for linking the

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,400
two concepts of digital sub 20 on one

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,560
end

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
and open so software promotion on the

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
other hand

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,280
there is a strategy for german

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,039
government cloud cloud

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
which doesn't mention actually open

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,560
source that mentions

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
the use of open standards and

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,840
distributed

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,639
systems this is related to open source

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,360
obviously but it's not exactly the same

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,440
and we've been told that three lenders

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
have explicit preference for free and

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,160
operational software

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,479
in their public procurement process

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
two other examples italy passed a law

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
nine years ago that were that did

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
mandate

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
the use of open source software for

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
every

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,240
project in the public administration

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,919
except for a few exceptions but what

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
happened is that the exception became

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,240
the rule

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,440
and at the moment it's this law had

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
zero impact and the public

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
administration is mostly now a microsoft

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,479
shop

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
and in sweden the agency for digital

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
government has published a policy that

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,520
says that software that is

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
developed or procured by the agency

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,560
shall be in the normal case

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,759
published as open source so what can be

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,440
done now and how do we achieve this

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,160
uh first existing regulation

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,520
whether the anchorage or say that open

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,639
source should be preferred

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,080
or if even if there should be

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,680
some obligation to use free and open

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
source in the public administration

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
these currently this regulation are not

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
currently

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,039
uh enforced or not sufficiently enforced

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,200
so they need to be enforced and if this

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,560
regulation don't exist that should

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,279
new regulation similar to the one we've

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
discussed should be implemented the

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
second point is that the free and open

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
source needs more promotion

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,399
not just foundations or

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,440
individual actors or open source

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,120
developer within the public

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
administration but also

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
the business sector and last there is

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
the name

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
need for financing both for innovation

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
work

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,480
and for maintenance work so here is a

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
three-part plan

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
first part is to double down on open

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
source program offices

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
we need open source program offices or

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
mission logician lib everywhere

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
at the state level at the commission

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
level

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,800
at the region level at dif various

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,920
ministries level

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,839
and all these hospitals should work

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,200
together and try to exchange

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,839
information and

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
case studies et cetera et cetera

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
secondly

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
uh these all sports should not just have

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,959
an internal

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
activity within the public

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,000
administration but also engage with the

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
businesses

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
that should be in their mission

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
currently it at least in france or in

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,240
the european condition

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,040
it's not explicitly written and

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,200
they should should have kpis and one of

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,320
the capilla kpis should be

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,519
the proportion of free and open source

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,720
software that's actually used

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,160
in the role of i.t purchases made by the

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
public administration so first

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,680
we need a tool in every ministry in

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
every

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,040
large public administration in every

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,720
member state or at the

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,360
uh eu institution level in order to

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
be able to measure these these

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
indicators

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,000
and then we should be able to measure

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
its progression

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,200
the second part is financing how do we

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
finance open source work

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,399
there's one thing there are some

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,440
instruments to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,600
implement to finance

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
r d and innovation like uh horizon

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,760
europe

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,160
but what's the part of the of horizon

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
europe

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
that's uh that goes to open source

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,240
software and

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
which part doesn't go we don't know and

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
this patch should

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,079
be increased then there is the the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,040
question of contractualization

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,640
between uh the public administration and

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
the free and open source sms that

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,880
actually produce

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,040
the open source software that are used

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,720
by the public administration sometimes

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,279
there are a lot of support contract

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,959
between a large administration and a

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,640
large i.t company

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,880
this contract sometimes it works but

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,480
sometimes the large i.t company takes

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
all the value from this contract

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
and there is no value left for the

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,320
company that actually create and

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,880
maintain

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
the the software that that are the

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
object of this contract this need to be

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
a monitored and

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
it there should be some rules and

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,880
regulation that will help

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,959
the system run more smoothly and then

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
for infrastructure software when there

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
are no

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,920
companies uh actually working on the

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,680
software

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,200
we should develop explicit funding

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,839
scheme in order

00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,600
to maintain these common dudes

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,160
the last part of our strategic plan

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,839
is to keep the playing field level for

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
free and open source software especially

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,519
for free and open to software companies

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
the public administration should promote

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,680
free

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
and open source software sometimes there

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360
are existing schemes like la france tech

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,959
in france to promote

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,120
um the digital technologies

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,880
companies in france but at this point

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
and the scheme has been going on for

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
more than five years now there have been

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
there hasn't

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,760
been any uh specific actions around free

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,440
and console software

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,000
uh there is a strong issue around

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
education so um

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,560
free and personal software concepts

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,720
should be taught to to pupils

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,000
uh in the education system or whenever

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,200
it's relevant and there is also need for

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
more

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,560
developers or software engineers that

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,720
are trained

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,680
uh with the concepts of free energy

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,800
software

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,519
there are several legal issues around

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
open source and with the probable legal

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
framework we will ensure

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
that open source software can still

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,560
thrive for instance with the right

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,399
interoperability requirement

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
with the right public procurement

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,920
regulation if we don't allow software

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,200
patents in europe

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,000
if with regulations around

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
digital privacy like the gdpr all of

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
this regulation

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
would will help uh level the playing

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,240
field and sometimes help

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
the the free and open source software

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,399
companies which are better aligned

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,320
with some of these regulations and

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
this regulation should also be used to

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,399
keep the big tech companies at bay

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
uh sometimes they are in the position of

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
monopoly

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
and sometimes they will abuse this

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
monopoly uh position

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
and of course in this case there should

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,240
be prosecuted

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
as they have been already in the past

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
what are our current plans at apparel so

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,839
there will be a joint publication in the

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,680
next weeks

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
where we'll expose this vision in more

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,920
details and this proposition

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
some national organization like cnll and

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
usba have been doing this for quite some

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,399
time

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,880
there will be some events at least a

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,839
first one with eu representative

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
and we hope uh thus that this free and

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,920
open source

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,680
id will be one of the items on the

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,720
french presidency's agenda

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,240
next year so that's all for today

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
there are some a few references

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,519
and i don't know if there is time to

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,519
question for questions thank you very

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,360
