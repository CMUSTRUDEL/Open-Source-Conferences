Title: Enhanced software dependency management with FASTEN
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	I will present how FASTEN project aim at giving more accurate dependencies insight by bringing evolution to the existing dependencies managers (such as Maven, Pip, etc.) by leveraging functions call graphs done across the whole ecosystem (e.g. Maven Central). You will learn how it can reduce false positives in reports that are recommending dependencies updates or detect issue at built time rather than at runtime. So if you are overwhelmed by constant notifications related to dependency upgrades, deprecation, etc. join me to find a solution!
