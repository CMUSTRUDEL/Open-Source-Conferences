architect

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,080
at new age labs i have been involved in

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,599
the development and design of spagobi

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,200
and knowage since a while i joined

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,600
engineering in 2005 when my colleagues

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,640
were releasing the very first version

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
of this pogo bi suite for who doesn't

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,399
know

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
spagobi was the previous brand name

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
before

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,800
knowledge the purpose of this speech

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
is to give you an idea about the new

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
functionalities

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
that version 8 of knowledge will

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
introduce

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
version 8.0 will be available this

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
summer

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,280
and other minor versions will follow

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
with

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
interesting new features

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,720
just a short introduction of knowledge

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,479
for people who

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,600
don't know what it is no age is a full

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
business analytical suite covering any

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,920
business intelligence

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,040
need for information distribution data

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,080
visualization

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,880
and analytical tasks starting from

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
traditional static reporting that you

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
can

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
even produce in a batch way and you can

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
deliver by

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
email up to the multi-dimensional

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
analysis

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,640
the olap analysis

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
but the main component of the platform

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
is the

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
interactive dashboard that allows you to

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
combine

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,200
data from different sources and navigate

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,040
through them

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,680
in an intuitive way it is designed from

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
a rich collection of widgets of several

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
types

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
such as chart table cross table and so

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
on

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,640
with full customization capabilities

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
in addition no age provides data

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,599
exploration tool

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,760
that we call the could be a kpi engine

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
to measure your performances

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,920
and support to spatial data to show your

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,040
kpis and information over a map

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,239
moreover funnel user has his own

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
workspace

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,440
where he can explore his data space

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,440
he can upload his own data and build his

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,319
own dashboards

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,519
no age is distributed in two different

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
editions

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
the community and the enterprise

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
editions

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,640
the community edition is free and open

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319
source software

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,920
distributed under the agpl license

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,000
while the enterprise edition is

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,720
commercial adding

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,599
mainly advanced features for the system

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
administrator

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
in the last version we released some new

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
widgets

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
that are very powerful within the

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,720
dashboard component

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,159
to enhance customization capabilities

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,280
and to permit

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,879
30 party libraries usage

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,879
in fact today you can plug your own html

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,480
and css code into the product inheriting

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,040
the full data context i mean

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
that data is injected by knowledge

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
itself

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
but you can retrieve it easily as well

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
as parameters

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,560
and other variables you can exploit the

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,920
custom chat widget

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,560
to develop charts using your favorite js

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,239
library even the ones that are not

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,040
included within noise distributions

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
you can plug r or python scripts for

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,080
powerful data visualization

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
or analytical tasks such as forecasting

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,280
clusterization

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,799
and so on with the discovery widget

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,799
you can query solar indexes and perform

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,920
full text search solar is a famous open

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
source indexing

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,879
and searching engine

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,799
this year we are going to work on the

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,239
main three pillars you see

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,440
in this slide first to provide

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,440
a rich set of pre-built components

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,639
a gallery of reusable widgets and

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
functions

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,680
and new components for natural language

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,479
based interaction

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
the second pillar has the aim to provide

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,960
the usage of knowledge

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
in a cloud environment not only the

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
presence

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
of knowledge in different marketplaces

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,919
but

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
also we will provide new features that

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
will

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,560
make the administrative tasks easier

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
in a cloud environment the third pillar

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
concerns

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
the general usability of the product

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,639
from many points of view

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
the general user interface matter and

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,080
new capabilities

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
in the self-service process

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
now i will show you some insight from

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
the main topics

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,560
as i said you can already use r or

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
python scripts within your dashboards

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
exploiting also light machine learning

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
models

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
in the new release we will provide a new

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
function catalog

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,280
that allows your data scientists to

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
write custom functions

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,240
such as predictors text tagging

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,199
clustering models classificators and so

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
on

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
and any final user without particular

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
skills

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
will be able to apply those functions on

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,039
data

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,720
and on widgets for example to add a

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,600
column in the data set

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
and plot it within a traditional chart

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
to enhance

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,800
the analysis this will allow

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
your spreading analytical capabilities

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,319
over the project

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,319
and across the users in an easy way

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,960
we are also working to provide a gallery

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
to collect

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,199
and share components that allows you

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,160
transform and

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,440
custom code you write into a kind of

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
template

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,759
that you can use again and again in

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
other dashboards

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,039
so when designing a dashboard you can

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
decide to start from scratch

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,240
or from some pre-built components that

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
are available within the gallery

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,759
and then link the right data into that

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
template

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,160
the gallery will provide some already

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,440
built html widgets

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,560
such as full set of cards sliders or

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,440
any other visual components are

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,960
or python widgets for example to show a

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,280
multi-dimensional space

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
or navigate to a cluster or

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,680
classification result

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,360
as well as well as building advanced

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,680
visualizations

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
and charts created using the custom

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
chart widget

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
there is a difference between community

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,080
edition and

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,919
enterprise edition here since gallery of

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
the enterprise edition

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,080
will actually contains pre-built widgets

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,199
community edition gallery functionality

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,080
will be there

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
but empty therefore users have to

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,840
populate it

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
themselves

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,880
knowwedge is already available on amazon

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,360
and we will soon deliver knowledge on

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,160
azure and google clouds

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
in addition to distribution we are

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,879
certifying the main

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,879
data storage systems that each cloud

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
environment provides

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,280
moreover we will make the remote overall

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,919
management easier

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,360
with new functionalities such as a

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,319
resource manager

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,960
and a new license management system we

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,520
will move to a floating license model

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,000
enabling the docker distribution in an

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
easy way

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,879
we are also working on natural language

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,240
support

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,400
to include a kind of chatbot

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
to support users in their usual

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
activities

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
to talk with them on a conversational

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,000
template basis

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
the template has to be prepared project

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
by project

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
according to the specific business

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
domain

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,080
you will be able to use all the

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,039
knowledge technical

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,120
and business metadata to enrich the

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
conversational path

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
the chatbot will know the name of the

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,039
analysis

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,640
their description the data and the

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,519
metadata they use

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
and so on all the metadata managed by

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
knowwedge

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,000
the aim is to provide a general support

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,800
to users as online help

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
and to support users when looking for a

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
specific

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160
analysis

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
another improvement will be on

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,800
self-service

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
with data preparation capabilities

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,120
enabling certain degrees

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,880
of data manipulation without the need

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
for a traditional etl

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
process when the user will start

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,240
uploading

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,519
his own data or using an available data

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
set to build his own dashboard or just

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,920
to explore his data space

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,240
he will be able to customize data

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,800
structure and content

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,839
i'm talking about general operations

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,200
such as grouping splitting or merging

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,560
filtering updating content enrich

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
or classify data transform continuous

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
data

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,600
into discrete ones always

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,839
in live preview to allow the user to

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
gain awareness of the data

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,240
and to check the result of the

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
transformations

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
here you can see the timeframe we

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,519
already released

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,680
the latest version of the 7 series

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
the new major release will be available

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
this summer

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,680
opening the 8th series here you can see

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
the novelties

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
talked about such as widget gallery data

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
preparation

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,079
and function catalog on

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,440
q3 this year we will work on another

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,560
general improvement

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,839
on self-service and on the natural

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,279
language integration and support

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,079
component those features will be

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
available

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,680
in the last part of the year along with

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
other general improvements for cloud

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,839
adoption

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,720
and general review of the user interface

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,720
to be more usable and more intuitive

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,640
that's it from my side here you can see

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,240
the links to the knowledge website

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,200
the online knowledge demo and our main

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,000
email address i hope you enjoyed this
