Title: On the challenges of migrating knowledge across software platforms
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Everyone uses its own system for storing, organizing and sharing knowledge : while some teams work will file shares and chat, others will use a dedicated CMS, or a wiki. While it can be easy to migrate a file and directory structure to another system (eg : migrating from a samba share to a GED), the same doesn't apply when migrating content created within a specific CMS or wiki. In this case, the information usually comes with its own set of metadata that also needs to be migrated and modified to fit in the new system. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges related to the migration of knowledge from one software to another, with a particular focus on the migration to a wiki-based knowledge management software : * What are the main points to consider when moving knowledge around ? * Which metadata should be kept ? * How to handle the migration of software-specific features (macros, annotations, specific document structures) ? * Which solutions exists in order to overcome vendor lock-in from proprietary platforms ? In the last part of this talk, I would like to start the discussion on how open standards could contribute with knowledge migration across different platforms, in order to leverage the challenges mentioned above.

[Music]

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,720
okay

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,080
so hi everyone thank you for being here

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,119
my name is clement obam

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
and uh i'm very happy to give this talk

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,119
which is entitled on the challenges of

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,840
migrating knowledge across software

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,439
platforms

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,760
at w2k1

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,000
so well let's dive right in writing we

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,360
only have 15 minutes

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
up so today i would like to tackle this

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
this problem in

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,760
four different parts basically uh the

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,200
first one being

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,280
providing a bit of context about

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,840
well knowledge and knowledge solutions

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
in general and how they work

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
and then i would like to also discuss a

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,800
bit about make version methodologies

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
particularly when you try to migrate

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,640
from one knowledge base

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
to another and here i will use the case

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
of

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
what we do at uh so in my company which

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
is xuikisas

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
for migrating users from confluence to

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
xwiki

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
then i'm going to describe a bit also

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
how we handle specific uh

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,040
features that may be in knowledge bases

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,159
for example extensions

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
which can be proved to be particularly

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
difficult

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,040
to migrate and finally uh

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
i would like to open on open standards

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,439
uh which could be interesting to to

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,600
develop in this field

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,159
which is something that we like so

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
just before we start who am i my name is

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,600
clement obama

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
i'm an account manager at xwiki sas so

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
x-wiki sas we are a software editor

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
we develop two open source software

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
which is x-wiki

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
so which is a wiki-based knowledge

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
management software encrypt pad

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
cryptpad can you can see it kind of as

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,320
an alternative

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,320
to things such as google drive but uh

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,600
end-to-end encrypted

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
uh going back on my side i'm

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
mostly passionate about open source you

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
can find me on different projects so x

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
wiki of course

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,920
open food facts or offers them and if

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,160
you want to contact me you have my email

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,440
so how do we manipulate knowledge today

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,599
well so so today you and i will both

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
work in environments that are

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,840
very probably knowledgeable meaning that

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,920
there is information everywhere

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
when you wake up in the morning you will

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
look at the news

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
and maybe open up your emails check the

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
company chats

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,560
and then maybe continue writing this

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
report that you started last evening

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
so you will write it maybe in in in a

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
wiki

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,080
or you will write it on some some drive

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
that you have

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
for example and then you will have to

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,400
send it back to your client

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,640
um and so what's interesting is that

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
every single one of these actions will

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
leverage some kind of knowledge that you

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
will have access to

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
uh and this knowledge is scattered

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,480
everywhere so in the emails you will

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
have the communication with your client

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
then in this report you will have all

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
the content of the of the report itself

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,400
and it's really

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,120
hosted in two different platforms

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
and so in order to access these

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
different platforms you will go

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
through kind of a tool it could be your

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,640
mail clients it could be

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
the ui of the of the drive that you are

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,760
using to edit your report

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
and so so here here i have a

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
listed a bit the kind of the solutions

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,159
that you that you may use

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
and um when you are using these

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
solutions

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
you will tend to actually do what's

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
intended for the solution but you may

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
also

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
start using a set of tools that are

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,360
embedded within the solution

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
uh but that are not really like for

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
example if i if i give you an example

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
um when you are writing an email using

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
google using gmail for example you have

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,840
this kind of features that

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,400
allows you to end automatically your

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,080
sentences and so

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
while using this tool you are using an

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
extra feature that is provided by the

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
mail client

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
uh that is not really uh the core need

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of a mail plan but that is

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
that kind of small little thing that

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
adds

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,519
really a main differentiator

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,400
and what's interesting is that going

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,919
more in depth

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
on this subject when you will be using

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,440
tools to set your knowledge so for

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
example chats if you want to

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
to discuss with your with your team

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
members

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
you will tend to use these small

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
features of the tool

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,440
uh in order to format your knowledge in

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
a certain way

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
so chats for example you could have a a

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,919
solution that uses

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,199
threads which is a specific type of chat

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
or maybe if you are using a

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
documentation platform such as

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,520
confluence of nx wiki

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
you you may use for example macros which

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,080
are you can use in documents to create

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
some generic content

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,479
and so to be clear this is really

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
something that we will see both in open

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,840
source and proprietary software and it's

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,880
really fine because

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
that's what actually gives a kind of a

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
main differentiator

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
to your solution and that's probably

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
what will

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,360
allow you or your team to choose it

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,360
compared to others

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,039
and so

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,199
well it's so it's so it's good to have

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,840
these features but in the meantime

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
whenever you want to to to migrate you

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
will also have to leverage them

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,600
meaning that you will need to find

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,919
equivalence uh

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
from the platform that you are migrating

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
to the

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
the the target platform that that you

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,400
that you want to have

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,680
so we'll go back on this subject

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,199
actually when we will discuss about uh

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,240
uh a bit more in depth now i want to

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
discuss about

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,759
um how we usually migrate

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
from one knowledge base to another and

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,280
here we'll take the example

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
of what we do as part of expertise uh

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,319
when migrating users for example from

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,520
confluence to expertise or from

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,560
any other solution to xwiki

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
so to give you a bit of context

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,759
i'm gonna actually use quite a lot the

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
example of confluence because

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
in last october atlassian which is the

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,240
editor of confluence

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
uh did a significant update to its

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
pricing model

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,440
which is basically well almost killing

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,919
the the prices for on-premise

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
licenses if you are a team of 20 people

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,520
and you want to have

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
a confluence as hosted on your premise

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,240
you will have to pay about

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,759
500 dollars which is not that accessible

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
for a small company

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,039
and so this is race concerns of course

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,639
especially for small and middle

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,479
companies

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
where the switch off to cloud is not

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,280
really wanted they don't want to have

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
their conference on the cloud

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,039
that they want it to have it on premise

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,280
maybe to keep control of their data

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,319
maybe uh because well they want some

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,400
some kind of protection

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,160
and uh so so this company basically

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
started looking maybe for alternatives

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
to conference

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,599
and uh maybe they end up

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
they ended up calling us because we have

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,680
a pretty good support for migrating off

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
of confluence to expect

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,680
and when we are looking at the content

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,840
migration so could it be from confluence

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,319
to to to or from something else

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
we usually have like three different

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
steps

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,199
on which we can approach immigration the

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,759
first step

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,440
would be to basically do what we call a

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,960
raw text import

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,680
so consider it basically as a

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
to me i see it more as a huge copy paste

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,039
of the

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
the current knowledge base that you have

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,000
and uh

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
and the target to the target knowledge

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
base that you that you are trying to get

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,840
so you may copy the data of the

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
documents but maybe you will lose some

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
metadata

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
you will especially lose potentially

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,599
some formatting which is not supported

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
and the one of the issues with this text

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,360
import

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,680
option is that you will also have some

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
users

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
which already have the burner the burden

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
of migrating from one tool to another

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
and it means also

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
uh changing the bed a bit the way they

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
work uh

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
and adapting to the new tool which will

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
also in the meantime have to deal with

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
this

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,039
loss of metadata for for the documents

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
and the information that is being

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,120
migrated

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
so it's an additional burden fortunately

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
today

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,919
we had we tend to have this lesson less

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
mostly because

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,399
we tend to have more and more either a

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,200
small api access or the possibility to

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
export

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,160
at least uh the general information of

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,279
the knowledge base

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
when we migrate it second option is

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,440
really when you have

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
um so well you you have the possibility

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
to export

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,600
uh a set of metadata that is related to

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
all the documents that you have in your

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
knowledge base

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
and you will actually configure the

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
target knowledge base to actually take

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,800
this metadata

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
and import it take it into account we

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
usually call that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
batch import in xwiki because we have a

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,200
tool that is actually designed

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
to to do this kind of imports

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,760
and so it usually looks like

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
uh having a csv on the side

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,440
uh that we contain on your or your

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
metadata and uh

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
and then next to it you will have also

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
other files which will uh

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
describe a bit the documentation that

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,160
you are trying to import

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,279
so quite interesting uh usually you will

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
get uh

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,040
you you may lose some information

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,959
because it's uh

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,640
it's it's a metadata that is fairly

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,480
generic and so

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,399
if you have a platform that is uh

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
uh that comes with a set of very

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
specific features it can be

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,360
well difficult to tune so that you you

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
don't lose anything

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,399
during this batch import and finally

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
there is one last solution which is kind

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
of the role

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
the rolls royce of the import you know

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,640
like uh it's where you you

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,399
you lose almost no data uh you you keep

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,279
the formatting of your pages

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,880
you keep all the well uh maybe in the

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,959
case of knowledge bases for example

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
in the case of wikis you will have some

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,240
documents which will have history and

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,120
you will keep all the history

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,440
and so this method will basically um

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
well

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
use a backup of the the the old instance

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
maybe a database dump

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,160
or uh or a specific backup format

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
or just plug into the api of the of the

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
of the platform

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
in order to do the import and so this

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
this is usually the best solution

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,360
the the main issue is that it's actually

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,880
a solution that is very specific it's

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,760
not something that you can

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,560
do for uh different types of knowledge

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,680
base at the time

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,480
but even with this class this

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,480
this last object option there are some

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,760
there are some limits basically

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
and the limits come from uh any kind of

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
extensions

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,079
or uh well additional plug-in

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
or feature that you may have put in your

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
knowledge base

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,480
so remember we talked about that in the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,160
in the first

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,320
slide uh and nowadays we

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,079
we see more and more uh tools that we

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
provide a marketplace

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
for extensions that will allow you to

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
better arrange your content

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
in the case of a wiki as i said it can

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,519
be for example macros

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,959
uh which will allow you to well

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,160
actually display them uh or display some

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,839
content in a certain way

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,079
i provide some dashboard and things like

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
that and it's really super useful for

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,040
organizing the content itself

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,079
uh it makes a great experience and uh

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,639
i i feel like it's it's really a

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,800
a good opportunity for for for knowledge

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,440
bases to use macros

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,120
or similar or similar tools but in the

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
meantime it will cause some issues

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,920
during the migration because you will

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,000
have to find some equivalence

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,959
of these macros in the new platform and

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
so sometimes

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,040
there is no equivalent and you need to

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,680
develop one which is costly

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
uh or sometimes there is also an

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,360
equivalent that exists

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,160
however it is um it's an equivalent that

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,240
is basically

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,440
limited or that works differently maybe

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
and you will have to tune

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
your importer in order to make sure that

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
uh the content that you import

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
fits correctly and you you don't lose

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,959
anything with your macros

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,000
um what we usually do for example for

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,760
this solution

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
uh at x wiki what we did is that we

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
created an open source migrator to take

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
data from conference and migrate it to

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
xwiki

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
and what we are doing also is whenever

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,560
we have a client that wants to

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
migrate and it has some macros from

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
confluence that

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,200
are not 100 percent compatible at first

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,120
with xwiki

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,240
we will uh propose them to

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,399
actually take these macros

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,000
uh do kind of a conversion and we put

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
this conversion as open source so that

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,639
it can be reduced in later projects

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
and that way your your migrator grows

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,560
and grows

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,800
with the time so finally

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,480
um and i will be very quick because i

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,160
only have two minutes left

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,440
um the what we are missing today is

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,959
really standards for

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
easing the data exchange across

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,959
knowledge bases uh

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
we really have none uh but in the

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
meantime if you look at the

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
other other kind of knowledge management

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
software

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,959
uh i'm thinking mostly about chats for

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
example

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
uh maybe emails or maybe just a document

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
platform so

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,880
drive and things like that there is

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,440
already a standard so for documents it

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,920
will be odd or tactics maybe

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
uh where you can move your files uh when

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,639
you want to

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,560
migrate from charts or maybe when you

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
want to be into two platforms

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
between each other for example you can

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,680
do bridge bridges with metrics so

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,480
nowadays it's possible

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,199
but for knowledge management software

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,560
such as for example wikis or maybe cms

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,199
you are we are missing these tools and

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,320
uh the main issue is that actually in

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,519
order to develop

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,720
them you need some time uh

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,680
it will also not benefit uh the the

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,399
providers that want to have login with

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
their uh

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,839
with the solution and so to me that's

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,600
why we we are missing kind of this open

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,560
standard

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,720
so that's the end of my talk uh i hope

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
that it was very useful for

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,000
for at least some of you and if you have

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
any question

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
maybe we have some time to take them so

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
thank you

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
