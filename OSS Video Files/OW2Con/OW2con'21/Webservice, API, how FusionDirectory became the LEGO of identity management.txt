Description: 
	Using a modern, simple and secure identity management system is nice. But it is equally important that this solution is easily scalable. From the conception of FusionDirectory great care has been taken in its API, it was built so that the developer can concentrate on the data to be stored in the LDAP directory. The API automatically builds the graphical interface and allows the plugin to fit into the system with its additional programming. The REST webservice provides a layer of abstraction while allowing the use of access control, models, macros and triggers. This conference will show you how API and webservices allow you to extend FusionDirectory while leaving ease and security at the heart of the system
