Title: Webservice, API, how FusionDirectory became the LEGO of identity management
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Using a modern, simple and secure identity management system is nice. But it is equally important that this solution is easily scalable. From the conception of FusionDirectory great care has been taken in its API, it was built so that the developer can concentrate on the data to be stored in the LDAP directory. The API automatically builds the graphical interface and allows the plugin to fit into the system with its additional programming. The REST webservice provides a layer of abstraction while allowing the use of access control, models, macros and triggers. This conference will show you how API and webservices allow you to extend FusionDirectory while leaving ease and security at the heart of the system

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
welcome to whyfrozen directory is

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,800
becoming the leader of iam

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,119
but first a word about us

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
fusion directory the company publishing

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,359
fusion directory

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
is an identity management specialist

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
expert on open source identity

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
management software

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,840
and specialized in higher education and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
research

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,840
once upon a time there was identity

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
management

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,480
the first issue is business application

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
many legacy business applications have

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
no ldap support

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,039
or really poor support business

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,520
application

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
developed in-house have not taken in

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
account

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
identity management and have lots of

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,200
manual processes

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
we often meet applications dedicated to

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,920
a category of user

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,400
written in-house but not maintained and

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
we are

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
never less important web services are

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
almost

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
non-existent

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,520
simplifying complex workflow today

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
the demand is for reliable and recent

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,320
data

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
simplification and automation reduce the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
work

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,439
and of course reduce the number of

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,640
manual action

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,920
to avoid human error

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,040
the inevitable manual work

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
use of intermediary account management

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,520
application

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,560
to add email password login creation

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,280
manual arrival of a photo plays

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
on a specific directory run by your

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,439
script and then

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,799
push inside the identity management

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
and so much of it

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,080
here come fusion directory

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,959
fusion directory is a web application to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
manage user

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,200
groups roles email dhcp dns series

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
specifics

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
it also manages system and deployment

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,520
tools

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
one of the most used functionality is of

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
course

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,239
the full support of supan 2019

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
and other software from the higher

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
education

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
we have also fine access control to

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
delegate tasks

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,000
customizable template trigger on editing

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
modification duration

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,400
verification full rep

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
service rest and support for gas

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
lemonade

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,120
with hood and ubiko

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
if you want to know more about the main

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
theater of fusion directory

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
i will recommend you to watch our

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,879
webinar series

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,840
in french only but it will give you an

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,840
overview of what fusion directory can do

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,959
first let's discuss about the fusion

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
directory

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,360
api at first

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
fusion directory which is derived from

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
gaza 2

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
didn't have an api but this spread

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,840
function

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,440
not intended to evolve and did not form

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,480
a complete seat

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,120
when we forked to make fusion directory

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
we were thinking about how to make a

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
clean happy

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,239
the most important theory of disappea

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
were

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
using an abstraction layer to facilitate

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
storage

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,799
in an ldap directory automatically bulge

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
graphical interface in a simple and

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
automatic way

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
automatically manage fusion directory sl

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
without writing additional codes

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
and of course provide a set of

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,080
attributes from the simplest to the most

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,400
complex

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
to simplify the writing of plotting

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
handling

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,879
complex data

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
the plugins offer various ways of

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,760
interact with your ldap data

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
add a tab to an existing type of object

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,840
have a new type of object

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,319
add a management page some kind of

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
listing and a new entry into menu

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,680
had new categories including dynamic

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
categories

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
add an email method and a new type of

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,479
service for server

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,479
and so on and so on

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,880
here you can see a little extract of the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
code

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
you see that this code will use a set

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
attribute

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
and inside it and select attribute to

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,040
select

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,880
a different kind of info to put into the

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,919
select

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
here you can see what this code is doing

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,479
as you can see

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,639
it automatically make the interface

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,600
the select box the combo box and

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,639
everything so

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,759
with little code you can really have a

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
nice

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
interface that can store your data

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
we have also some kind of advanced

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
attributes

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
for example the set attribute wraps

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
around

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
an attribute that's not multiplied to

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
make one

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,039
being multi-evaluated the composite

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
attributes

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,400
allow a singular to load up attribute to

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,120
split

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,039
into several attributes in the interface

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,080
here you see the case

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,919
of a dns record and the object attribute

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
allowed to choose object

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,120
via a management window and only click

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,120
on the object

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,479
foreign key it's like some foreign key

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
you see in database system

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
it will update the reference when the

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,479
object is modified

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,520
and you can look in the reference tab to

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,680
see what other place this object linked

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
to

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,960
3 being a web interface also

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,560
have some theme in place so you can

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,199
build your own team

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,919
to reflect the color of the company of

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
the way you want people to see things

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,680
so you can manage that through css

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
and smarty you don't have to redo the

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,639
world css you just

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,880
update the part you want in your team

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
and the global team will adapt

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,199
automatically

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,360
for icon we built a free desktop library

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,880
for php so you can use

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,440
classical econ theme and the css

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,919
it's in less format for programmer so

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
it's easy to generate variation in color

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
from

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,560
text and size

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,600
here you see two different team one from

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
the condorcet

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,440
campus and one from ob2 you can see that

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,479
you can

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
customize nearly everything change color

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,759
check

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,759
in and so on

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,919
now let's talk about the web services

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
web services are really important today

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
because

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,440
you don't want to continue to give

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,240
access to your ldap server to lots of

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
people

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
lots of script you want to have some way

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,319
of

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,479
getting data from your identity

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,560
management system and pushing data to

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
your identity management system

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,880
but with control about the data

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,440
control how to make the data let acl

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,319
do their role and restrict what people

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,199
can do

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
here you have a classical way of using

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,960
the web services

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,080
you have two database you get the data

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,360
through the web service

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,680
to the database you send the data

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
to fusion directory with the web

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
services

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
it will validate if you have the right

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,440
to access

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,639
the data then it will validate the data

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,599
he'll receive

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
he then will apply the template activate

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,599
the macro

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,720
and create the full object in its full

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,599
capacity

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
then create the user and then of course

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,360
he can

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,319
access the fusion right trigger to send

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
this data to

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,440
other applications that need to be

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
automized also

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,560
the web service is based on the open api

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,840
specification we offer a file in this

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
format that

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,319
lists all the available operation some

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
client directory

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,560
support is format to generate queries

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,199
you have the url

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
for the official documentation and if

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
you install fusion directory

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,159
you can open this file as well mentioned

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
here

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,039
here you have some example of web

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,159
service call

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,440
let's look for a user let's

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,880
look when you know the user the uid

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,160
number of the user

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,399
and then let's put a new id

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
number to this user here is an example

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
for

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,760
a mail account oh can i get do attribute

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,800
mail goes a mill server goes on the

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,000
mail account use case

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,360
that's the interesting part

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,880
first ob2 a way to use

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,160
fusion directory to create a user

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,800
they use it to list member to do the

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,320
white page they have some internal tools

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,120
based on a web service

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,640
that can do something like give me the x

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,880
or grad type member

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,279
who registered between search and search

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
date they let me the user with your

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,760
ideas

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,800
here you can see the page that goes

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,120
inside x wiki with file field

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
user and this page will then contact the

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,760
web services

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,440
to create the user infusion directory

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,040
here you have the white page

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,839
the second case it's a telecom suit by

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,680
telecom should they use extensively the

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,320
web service and template

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,160
to provision their user in all their

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
complexity

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
when i say in all their complexity they

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,920
are using at the maximum

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,399
we create a user from the air system

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,880
and we create the user the mail account

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,120
the mail account on the zimbra server

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
all the supern functionality all the

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,079
data for the

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,200
access cards and also the signal of

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,279
life is done at the same time

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,920
and they use unicampus and fusion

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,279
directory unicampus is the software to

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,120
make the batches

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,360
they use unicampus from fuson directory

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680
to send the data to make the batch

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,240
and new campus will send back the sale

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,240
number the batch so the data

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,320
stays in fusion directory infusion

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,680
directory as the control of it

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,040
and also they're using now web service

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,160
to archive a personal account or

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
a student account and to respect the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
gdpr

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,040
this archive will only conserve the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
minimal

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,640
information needed here

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
you have an explanation of the

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
processing

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
in telecom supply as you can see you

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
have a staff database

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
and you have student temporary group and

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
classes

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,440
all goes to the same synchronization

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
process

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
they go to the web service of fusion

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,040
directory

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,760
who is making the access control and

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
then

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
with the application of model it

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,519
automatically creates the user

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:39,839
ismail superintendent physical and super

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,120
multi-service card with the access card

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,040
and for example this is the um

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
getting back the number from the

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,920
unicompass

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,000
so in this case any campus told to a web

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,760
service this web server is stored to

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
fusion directory web service

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,519
and it inserts the batch number inside

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
fusion directory

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,680
so we have all the information inside

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,399
the identity management system

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,519
you want to know more here are two links

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,680
you can request

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:16,240
a demonstration of if you want

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,240
thank you for listening and have a nice

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
