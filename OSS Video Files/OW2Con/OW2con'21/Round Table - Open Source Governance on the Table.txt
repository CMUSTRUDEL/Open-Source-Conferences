presentation and uh

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
and cooking so we've heard several

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,720
toasts about open source governance and

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,600
just as many different perspectives

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,320
on the topic so we also had in the

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,240

tech with the technicalities of this uh

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,799
live roundtable so uh this roundtable is

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
the perfect setting

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
for an announcement that we have been

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
preparing and

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
as i just said at the end of my

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
presentation that

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
european non-profit associations

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,239
organizations are teaming up

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,080
to launch what we have called the ospo

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
alliance

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
so we joined forces with leading

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,959
european open source non-profit

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
organizations such as the eclipse

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
foundation

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,599
and foundation for public code plus the

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
open forum europe

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,800
to establish hospital alliance and

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,879
create the osposon website

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
the mission of the hospital alliance is

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
to grow awareness for open source in

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
europe

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
and globally and to promote the

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
structured and professional management

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
of open source

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,280
by companies and administrations so

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,319
for rw2 the ospo alliance is a channel

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
to disseminate

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
the good governance initiative

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
methodology that have been introduced

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,400
earlier on

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
and to what this methodology is to

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
implement hospitals

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
but the ospo alliance is much more than

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
that has great ambitions

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,280
and maybe mike if you want to comment on

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
the ambitions of the hospital alliance

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
thank you for that excellent

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
introduction cedric really appreciate it

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,159
and i just want to call out again thank

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
you for all the great work that you've

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,159
done on the good governance initiative i

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,879
think that's really helped

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
seed the contents that we have at ospo's

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,480
own um

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,319
and uh and helping us really kick off

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,519
the ospo alliance with some

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,440
with some really good content uh so for

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,400
the aspirations of the oscar alliance i

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
think it's

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
most importantly um this is a global

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,360
initiative

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,239
uh started in europe and so that is um

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
that is the the aspirations for this

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
it's

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,120
not just about uh helping tech companies

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
build open source program offices

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
as you mentioned it's for corporations

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,080
of all types

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,159
and in particular in the european

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
ecosystem you see a lot more sort of

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
industrials and enterprises than you

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,799
typically see in the pure

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,200
software giants in silicon valley so

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,560
there's

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,720
definitely a somewhat different

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
take on the role of an ospo in those

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
kinds of organizations

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,799
and i'm sure with the other panelists

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
can talk about this far more than i but

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,880
in the role of public administrations

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
and the government adoption and

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
contribution to

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
open source um i think that's another

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
very important focus area

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
i think you know taking from what you

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
did with the good governance initiative

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
one of the key messages that we want to

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
bring to all of the organizations

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,680
um that are that are going to be

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
engaging with uh with the ospo alliance

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,440
uh

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
is that is the importance of

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,360
contribution and participation

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,720
as well as use and compliance uh and so

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
that's really going to be one of the

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,199
the i think the key focus areas

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,960
for the ospo alliance is really helping

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
the organizations that are starting

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
their open source journeys

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,639
to understand and recognize the

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,600
importance of participation and

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,639
contribution

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,960
um and you know one of my all-time

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
favorite presentation slides is you know

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,680
open source is free

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
just like a puppy um and you know it's

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
you know it takes

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,360
care and feeding um for to for to foster

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
the open source communities that are

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
delivering

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
all of this important value and

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
co-creation collaboration and innovation

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
that's happening within the broader open

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
source community

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,520
i've been very much looking forward to

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,199
working with my colleagues and peers in

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
the ospho alliance

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,440
to help further this mission thank you

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880

you're the cio of the city of paris

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,880
and the city of paris has become pretty

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,000
visible in the open source world lately

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,319
so maybe two things for from you

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
can tell us what open source represents

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,639
for the city of paris

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,639
and also what you can expect from the os

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,199
or alliance hello everyone

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
uh first of all i would like to thank uh

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
aw

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
to organization for having me today on

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
this panel

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,400
and for their work ever ever since the

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,520
city has been a member of the consortium

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,280
thank you cedric so yes

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
open source software is extremely

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,880
important to the city of paris

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
not only because it's efficient more

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,120
efficient

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:39,360
but also because it reflects our values

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,360
and the values of the executive team

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,440
you're right we we are more visible now

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,720
because the city of paris was more

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
focused

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
on developing open source tools to

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,199
achieve our digital objectives

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639
but now uh we are aware that it's

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,240
necessary to promote

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
our work and um to promote our open

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
source strategy

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,000
and to share more with other

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,599
organizations cities administrations

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,759
so open source strategy for is a real

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,960
commitment

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:21,120
first of all it's a political commitment

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:25,039
and here in paris open source

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,479
is supported by the mayor

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:32,160
the deputy the first deputy mayor and

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,680
the team or the executive team and they

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,880
understand its value and

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,020
they sponsor its use so we are

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,520
very lucky for that

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,840
[Music]

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,960
it's also a commitment from the ethical

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,639
point of view we encourage

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,120
uh the the executive the the executive

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
team

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,479
and the i.t department encourage

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,759
sharing and reusing all the work

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:09,360
because it's paid with the public money

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,400
and we try to open

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
our source base uh

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,720
and for us opening the source base is

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,160
more than a technical matter

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,080
it's also a matter of ethical

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
commitment and i think it's very

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,199
important because if

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,520
when i discuss with the other cios in

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,320
other cities or administration

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,839
if we don't have this commitment from

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,519
the top management

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,800
it's very very difficult to um

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,839
to to promote open source strategy

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,959
it's a responsibility for the cio

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,800
because we can't say that it's

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,519
the fault of an editor if something is

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,760
wrong

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,519
something doesn't work it's the

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,519
responsibility of the cio

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
it's also uh using uh

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,880
open source is also for us cost

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,760
effective

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
really every time we launch we launch a

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
project

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
a big project we have to compare the

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
open source solution versus the

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
proprietary solutions

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,279
we look at the return on investment and

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,040
all the necessary requirements

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,920
the deadline the cost etc and depending

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
on the domain uh open source is often

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
cost saving

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,080
and keeps us independent and it's very

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,279
important but we we are aware that for

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,800
special domains like financial or hr

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,040
we can't um we can't propose uh

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
open source solution because they

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,640
already exist on the market

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,160
and we have to uh to use them

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,000
so you would agree you would agree in

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,320
asia that there is much more to

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,920
hospital managing open source than just

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,200
managing compliance

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,600
it's a very uh it's a complex uh

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,519
approach and uh you need you need the

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
support of the top management as well

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,079
yes exactly very interesting yes

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
maybe because you're a big

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,079
administration uh at the city of paris

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,839
but i think and we come back to you in

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,480
nature but i think

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
the european commission is even larger

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
larger

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,160
than that and is it um

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,480
you you do talk about establishing ospo

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,920
and what what do you have what do you

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
put in that

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,800
thank you cedric well first thanks

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,040
ow two for having us here and um

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
i actually completely agree with what uh

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
niger just said

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
um for example about the support of the

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
um

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
of the leadership it's essential without

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
that um

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
you can't get very far this is something

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,279
that i picked up when i was working for

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
the commission's open source observatory

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,160
this is something that

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
all the open source projects and all the

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,320
member states would echo

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,079
but at the commission you see it as well

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,240
and it's actually thanks to

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,160
very solid support from the commissioner

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
the commissions the commissioners right

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
and the commission

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,800
of digit um the director general and the

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
directors for open source that we have

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,160
a strongly established open source

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
energy that was announced last year

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,640
to to sum it up for for people outside

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,320
of the commission and i think

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,000
paris is actually bigger in size

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
as a public service than the commission

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,160
is but to sum it up what the ospo will

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
try to do what the oscar is actually

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,600
doing

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,839
is removing the organizational and the

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
legal bottlenecks to open source that

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,560
exists

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
that are currently making it difficult

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
for the commission to use more open

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
source

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
and are making it difficult for the

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,639
commission to share its solutions under

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,680
an open source license

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
and i'm actually very happy to to sort

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
of

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,040
announce that we've made in the short

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
time that we're there we've made some

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
big steps

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
it's also because everybody wants these

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
things to change so

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,760
it's now it's now easier for commission

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,360
development projects to to work on code

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
bases of their colleagues

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,720
previously that was a bit cumbersome

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
we've changed that

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
but sometime this summer it will become

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,560
a lot easier

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
for the commission to share their

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
software solutions under an open source

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,120
license

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
that's the biggest bottleneck we've been

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,079
working on it with a bunch of lawyers

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
around the commission in sessions the

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,519
past months and we're

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
we're about to push this into the

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
machine so that it will come out and

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,680
then it will be

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
a european thing and then it will

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,040
you know that doesn't mean that the

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,880
flood case will open but it will

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,639
make sure that projects will start to

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,360
trickle out of the commission

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
there's a lot of projects out there so

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
we hope

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,160
that the community will be uh using that

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,760
yeah so it's interesting interesting to

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,120
hear you say that paris is probably a

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
big administration than the european

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
commission

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,079
we usually see the european commission

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,800
as a rather big administration

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,200
anyway from the i.t perspective perhaps

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,920
uh

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
paris is more uh i mean they have a lot

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,040
to do and

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
they really develop their own services

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
and

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,839
i must say that we are very actually

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
blessed to be able to work with the city

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,720
of paris in uh

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
developing this methodology they are

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
they are really uh really

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,800
helpful uh an example to follow but

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,079
maybe another example to follow and we

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,560
i'm looking at deborah bryant here that

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,480
really after what you've heard uh you

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
have firsthand experience from learning

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,199
what is probably one of the most

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,600
influential

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
in our industry really so what what

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
would be your

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,320
your your reaction to what you've heard

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,199
and uh what would you expect from the

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,199
ospo alliance

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,199
we can hear you new mute

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,440
first of all we'll start by unreading

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,079
which will help if we're doing a podcast

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
so first of all thank you cedric for in

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,440
including

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
me here uh in the panel today these

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,360
wonderful

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,240
uh experts uh my my initial reaction for

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,519
the ospo alliance is a

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,160
fantastic a great deal of my work

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,240
includes conferring with customers and

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,079
other people in the industry that are

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
are struggling to find out how to adopt

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,079
open source or to even

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,040
develop their own program i'm especially

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
excited about

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,040
this alliance because it's a

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,920
cross-industry alliance

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,440
and i like to think of open source and

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,800
sustainable open source

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,519
and useful open source uh as an open

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
ecosystem so if you have a private

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,959
sector

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
the public sector nonprofits and

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,959
academia

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,880
adopting this kind of construct around

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,839
using open source program offices

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,639
in a small or large to further their

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
goals

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
in my experience the the challenges are

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,639
not technical

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:06,480
in an adoption uh it it has to do

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,399
with uh with leadership and uh resource

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,079
and and cultural change and then having

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
an imagination to see where it can be

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,279
used so

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
i see this is a highly beneficial

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,519
alliance

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
and i can also see some potential uh if

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,800
you think about

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,279
ecosystem includes everything from a

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,079
student learning skills to become part

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,760
of industry or the public sector

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
all the way through to companies that

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,440
are innovating

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,800
through open source software and

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
contributing

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
to economic development there may be a

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,800
possibility of the future you'll find

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
that this is a great

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
back fence so to speak to have

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
discussions around what projects you're

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
working on

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
you have to remember open source always

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
starts with something and there may be

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
other things that come out of the

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,360
alliance in the future

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,759
that you have not even expected but um

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,759
you

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,120
you talk from this perspective of red

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,160
hat which is uh

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,199
my red hat is entirely in the open

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
source world

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
but uh what sort of and having

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,040
established a nospo

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,560
what sort of advice would you give to

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,079
the european commission or to the city

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
of paris because they are

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
establishing this they have to convince

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
maybe

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,320
some top management or they have to make

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,079
room for the ospro

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,199
uh is there any narrative that they have

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,240
to build in order to have this hospital

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,040
more easily adopted by the the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,519
management

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,199
and the rest of the organization now i

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
can appreciate that and i personally

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,279
have worked

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
in the public sector so i have an

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,360
appreciation for

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,120
the concern about risk uh people that

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,399
work in the public sector are concerned

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,440
about being stewards

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,959
of public funding and so uh they they

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
take care not to misstep

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,440
but once they understand the the

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
benefits and the opportunities and i

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,000
think it becomes a matter

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
of i mean the good news is today we have

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
lots of examples

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,639
of the successful deployment of open

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
resource

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,480
we also have a great number of

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,800
practicing open source program offices

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,600
that are now producing material

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,439
and uh you'll you'll be a great example

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,600
as you start to populate uh

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,559
the resource so i would say you know my

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
advice is

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,400
to look for case studies uh that support

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,760
what you're working on to bring in your

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
peers have had

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
similar experiences and are managing the

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,319
same risk that have been successful in

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
that

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,720
their safety and numbers and and build a

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
story playing that and then bring people

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,440
in from the outside

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
there's an expression you can't be a

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,520
prophet in your own land

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
sometimes you need to have someone from

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,480
outside your organization i've actually

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
spoken at other

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
we've had teams go to other ospos

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,039
because a leadership of a company may

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,799
be or an institution may be interested

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,120
in hearing the advice of others so

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,080
that's a good practice too right so i'll

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,559
go back to our

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,760
users the european commission and the

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,760
city of paris

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
uh so you're you're you're bound to be

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
establishing your own suppose not on

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
your own but uh you are

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,880
have to connect with all the rosters

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,200
nation

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,559
any any perspective any plan to connect

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
with other sports or

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,000
engage with other cities or are we

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,960
planning a

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,240
or maybe maybe can we should we plan a

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,160
big city chapter

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,480
in the hospital alliance go and race

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,799
what about the european commission and

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,400
connecting different hospitals

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,320
i sorry we would welcome that very much

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
it's actually something we're already

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,720
doing

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,720
we have can't say regular we have quite

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
regular meetings with with other with

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,480
colleagues in member states

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:42,320
um and beyond where we we try to get a

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,559
feel for how others are approaching um

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,160
the bottlenecks that that we see how

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,880
others are scaling their

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
organizations um we're sharing material

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,320
with others

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,919
so um yeah and this alliance

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
that you announced this morning i think

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,919
it's it's

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,799
it's very welcome in the commission i

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
can say

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
at least the hospital will be happy to

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,360
work with them and introduce them

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
where necessary where relevant to uh to

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,039
others in the commission

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,200
yeah thanks so mike our assignment so

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,120
what do you expect us to do what should

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,919
we what should we do for

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,760
to facilitate this uh interco not

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,840
interconnection of hospitals but um

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,799
at least the sharing of experience

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,880
between those sports

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,880
in order to accelerate adoption

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,400
the first thing we need i think is a

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
meeting place and

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
that's one of the things that i hope is

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,400
going to happen at ospo zone as a result

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,799
of the ospo alliance

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
when we've been running with ospos

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,919
aren't a new idea

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,799
um they've been uh common in the uh ict

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,240
industry

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,799
for 20 years the reason they seem novel

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,360
is there was never any way to find them

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,919
so you always stumbled across them

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,559
inside

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
an enterprise once you started digging

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
and so

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,440
i think it would be very important for

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,480
the ospo alliance to create a venue

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,760
for ospos to find each other

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,679
and to maybe become a lending library

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,480
for open source offices

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,120
so that organizations can borrow them

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
for their

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
internal summit meetings to share

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
experiences

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,640
i think another thing that will be

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,280
important is to find a safe way for

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,960
people to share stories of failure

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,840
um the the the most important lessons

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,799
in ospos are not the the successes that

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
have been run through

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,320
uh legal and pr to put the company in a

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,320
good light

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
but rather the disasters that no one

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
ever finds out about

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,240
so for example i can tell you about one

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,360
at sun that we had

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
because the company doesn't exist

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,840
anymore we

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
after having spent three years getting

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
sun's open source program office up and

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
running

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,400
um the uh oem

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
division in sun tried to create an

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
alliance with

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,760
the santa cruz britain and

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
um we we found out about this the day

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,159
before it was announced

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,159
and fortunately managed to get the ceo

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
to uh to shut it down

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,000
um and uh you know i'd love to share

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
that story with ospos

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,760
to try and help people understand that

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,120
it you know all the good governance

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,720
initiatives in the world

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,679
are no replacement for having the direct

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,320
air cover from your chief executive uh

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
for the

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
sorts of things that you're doing

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,320
because the sort of thing you're dealing

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
with in a lost poke

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,520
can be very critical to a business they

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
can lead to

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,679
uh to stop ship orders if you're a

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,400
manufacturer they can lead to

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
a serious international level litigation

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
if you get

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,039
licensing and deployment matters wrong

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,039
and so you really do

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,559
want to have air cover from your

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
executives so those would be the two

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,400
things that i would do i would

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,200
i'd create a venue for you to find each

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,559
other

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,799
and i would create a safe way for

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,640
organizations to share the dirty stories

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,960
as well as the lovely clean ones

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,000
okay we'll do that so that's ospo zone

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,640
so hospital.zone will be the place

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
and mike so what should be our game plan

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,919
because we've done we've announced

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,000
something now but

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,520
and we have some content with the good

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
governance initiative but now we need

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
much more than that so

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,760
uh tell us about the the perspective the

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,600
hospital alliance within the next 12

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,919
months

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,159
so in addition to what simon just said

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,039
about you know touting out successes and

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,360
and sharing the failures there's a lot

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
of

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,919
work that just has to happen right so

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,640
um i think and that's sort of like the

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,559
the

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
the bulk of the bell curve is is really

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
about helping

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,039
everybody understand what are the best

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
practices

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,159
um and what are the uh you know where

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
does the work go

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
into uh creating making it easier to use

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
and adopt

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,840
but also contribute and participate um

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,200
into the uh

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,720
in you know into and via the ospos

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
so we're starting off with the and this

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,600
is sort of a question uh answer

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
partially an answer to a question that

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,360
christian patterson just asked on the

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,000
chat as well which is

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,159
um you know we're starting this off with

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
uh the good work that uh ow two and

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,720
cedric have done with the good

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,720
governance initiative

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,159
but that's the starting point um you

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,280
know be to to uh

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,159
you know um a mighty oak starts

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,120
from a small acorn um and so the the

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
plan here is

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,520
is to grow and constantly grow through

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,559
community engagement

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,600
a set of resources around best practices

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,039
um for the establishments and the

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,840
ongoing management

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:47,120
of ospos but in but ospos are really the

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,320
a mechanism by which organizations as a

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
whole

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,760
engage with open source projects and

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,120
open source communities

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,039
um you know ospos are a means to an end

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,480
um and so the best practices that we

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,720
want to promote um

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,840
through the hospital alliance and the

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,200
ospo zone is a collection of

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,880
resources to really help organizations

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,559
engage with open source projects and

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,559
open source communities

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
on a worldwide basis so that's that i

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,120
think that's really what the game plan

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
is

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,720
for the next little while i think from

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
from a call to action

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,159
for uh people that are that are

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,480
listening uh to this and

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,760
and are interested in doing more is

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,720
become engaged

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,400
um this is ultimately a community a

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,919
community initiative

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,760
and the resources that we want to

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,880
collect are going to come from

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,840
um from you the listeners um that we're

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
going to to

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,520
allow us to build up the resource base

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,720
um that we want to provide

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,080
to and share with it with everybody so

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,039
please come and sign the statement of

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,760
support um and but even more importantly

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,400
uh participate with us and contribute

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
content

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
uh yes the ospo zone yeah definitely

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
something

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,080
i can add to that is we are and there is

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,480
a question about what's the difference

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,919
between those pro alliance and the good

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
governance initiative

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
uh you should look at the good

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
governance initiative as the methodology

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
to implement the nospal

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
but that's what we do we're just

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
developing this methodology and i must

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
say that we have great help from the

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,960
city of paris

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,000
as a beta tester and challenging us and

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,039
making sure

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
that it's what we all propose that we

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,279
should try is really

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
realizable so really much much

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,760
appreciated

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
but uh then beyond that there is all

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,720
this

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
interconnection and creating the network

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
of hospitals or

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
putting people together in as simon

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
share said

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,760
sharing experience or sharing failures

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,559
and sharing resources and so we expect

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360
resources

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,080
nisha can we hear you now uh yeah can

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,200
you hear me

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,720
yes we can hear you if you can comment

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,000
thank you uh so we have started in paris

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,840
we have started working with rw2 and

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
the good governors methodology to

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,720
implement our

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,600
own ospo as pilots we are now

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
in the process of defining objectives

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,360
and

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,720
how to implement them we are very

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,080
pleased to see the

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,880
aw-2 approach endorsed by other european

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,200
organizations

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,320
encouraging its use by more public

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,000
administration because

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,640
it's probably more difficult in the

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,159
public sector i think

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,279
so we regularly meet with the cios

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,480
from other cities european cities but

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,360
also french french ones and

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,279
we are used to sharing our experience

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,400
but the the ospo alliance

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,400
will bring a critical mass we hope

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
that the hospital aliens will bring

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,600
critical mass

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,120
to this project sharing it with the

00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,799
other cities as well as learning from

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,919
from them so

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,039
i think a chapter a special chapter in

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,559
the

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:12,240
uh for cities

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,919
is um is interesting uh for big cities

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,880
but also maybe for

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,360
uh uh small cities because we all have

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,000
the

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:27,120
the same needs and probably

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,080
the cities have a particularity we have

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,679
a lot of business slides limited

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,720
and it's very different from a

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,679
public administration or

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,320
a private company which is the which are

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,320
focused

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,279
on one two three maybe five businesses

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,679
uh in a city even in a small city we

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,039
have

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,080
four uh in paris we have 400

00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:00,159
businesses so we have

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:04,799
400 i.t systems so it's um

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,360
i think it's something very special

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,200
i worked in other sectors and when i

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,320
came in city of paris

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,679
i discovered this so

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,720
we need to share more for one need for

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,840
example

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,320
it it can be very interesting to share

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,240
with other cities so yes i think that

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,279
it's necessary to have a chapter for the

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,080
cities because of this

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,200
particular aspect but we also need to

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,799
share with

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,960
very different structures structures are

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,360
very different

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:47,039
from us like the private sector or

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,880
international organization

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,559
right yeah it's it's something that

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,960
we've discovered

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,120
trying to apply this methodology is that

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,200
each situation is very

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,200
specific so we have a top-down

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
methodology that is very abstract and

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
then each organization has to customize

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
it for

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,159
their own needs and all specifics and

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,200
for that we may need some

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,279
uh we may well the

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
experience nothing replaces actual

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,760
experience

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,600
uh deb you look at it from uh from uh

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
from a certain distance and plus

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,520
you're not a large end user but more

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:27,600
part of a large supplier

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,240
so i don't know how um i mean

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,880
how how this resonates with your own

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,919
experience or expectations and

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,080
and i was just thinking uh listening to

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
what was said that maybe we would need

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,200
to set up an advisory board and

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,000
you probably would be welcome in it well

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,640
thank you

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,640
well i think i'll go back to my comment

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,720
about thinking about open sources and

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,720
ecosystems although it is true that

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,840
we're a large supplier

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,279
we're also a large participant in

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,640
and so for us it's important for

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,679
uh for every aspect of the the

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,520
uh the ecosystem of the industry to

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,240
do well now we have in many cases

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,760
our customers are also the people we're

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
working within projects

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
and so we have a bit of a different

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,120
relationship with open source

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,880
all these aspects of good governance

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,559
uh good governance contributes to

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,520
healthy communities

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,799
there's certain certain best practices

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,039
that support

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,000
healthy projects you know transparency

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,559
and openness

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,720
there's roles for software foundations

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,360
as contributors and consumers there's

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,039
roles in the public sector as consumers

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,480
and also as contributors and

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,440
in many cases we're seeing that

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,320
growingly so for me it just makes a lot

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,799
of sense to

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
convene and share best practices

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
although we

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,559
have different perspectives from the

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
seat we're in but

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,720
none of this is in isolation and the

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,519
less it is in isolation the more we all

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
benefit

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,440
uh to serve the the purpose of whatever

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,080
our role is

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,960
great thanks so we are building critical

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,279
mass and

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
sharing experience and making sure that

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,640
uh

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,399
adopting open source uh well we are

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,480
building the state of the arts in

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
what it should be an hospital now i

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
think we are getting short on time and

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,000
it's a

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,480
time for uh well say closing remarks

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,200
i'll i'll go in the order of my uh

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080
of what i see on my screen from because

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,120
we're on

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,320
gt uh meeting actually here

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,960
starting with uh mike oh

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,559
great uh just want to say that this is

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,039
an exciting announcement we're very

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,960
happy to be participating um with our

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,159
with our peers um in europe to launch

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,799
this global initiative

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
and we're very excited to bring the

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,399
community together to

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,039
help document best practices for ospos

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,320
so

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,799
onwards and upwards thank you mike

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,760
simon i'm very excited by

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,880
the oswald alliance work partly because

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,919
it's actually open

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,799
so anybody can join in and that way even

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,399
the smallest organizations can

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,679
gain experience use the materials and

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,480
contribute their insights and secondly

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,600
because

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,399
um it's focused very much on a european

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,600
approach

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:25,600
which has uh smaller enterprises

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,120
and has got um a a a scale and a set of

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,200
needs that are unique

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,320
and not currently being reflected in

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
discussion about

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,919
open source governance so i very much

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,960
welcome it and i'm looking forward to

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
joining in

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
from the perspective of a smaller

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,399
individual organization and a smaller

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,399
enterprise

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,840
yeah there is no small it's all about
