00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
hi

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
i'm simon phipps and i'm back at ow2con

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
again

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,359
to talk to you a little bit about what

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,559
the open source

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,040
program office at sun microsystems

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,000
did i'm talking here about something

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,200
that happened

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,200
between 1998 and 2010

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
and it's possible that you don't

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,399
actually remember

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,680
some microsystems some microsystems um

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,280
ceased to exist in 2010 on acquisition

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,719
by uh oracle oracle were

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,960
mainly it seems acquiring rights to the

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,400
java platform so that they could go sue

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,600
google but prior to that sun had existed

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
for a couple decades and was one of the

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,840
key innovators

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
in the ict industry introducing in

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
particular sun workstations

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
and then introducing a range of

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,479
technologies

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,479
from tc case tl to

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,080
pioneering rpc to pioneering desktop

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
workstation computing

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,720
to introducing java to pioneering the

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,200
use of java on phones

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,479
and most importantly they were purveyors

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
of

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,520
the spark architecture and of the unix

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,600
operating system under the name solaris

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,799
running on top of that

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
sun was a rich source of innovation and

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
the reason for that was because it had a

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,960
very open culture

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,200
very reminiscent of the

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,880
west coast open source movement the bsd

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,079
style open source movement

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,479
with people um repurposing technology to

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,479
innovate in ways that the originators

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,280
weren't necessarily expecting

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,039
the original workstation called the

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
company was called sun because it was

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,720
a workstation for the stanford

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,280
university network that was originally

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,560
created into a product was based on open

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
source uh the

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
unix operating system on it was based on

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
bsd unix

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,760
and the maintainer of that bsd unix

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
distribution bill joy was one of the

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,879
founders of the company

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,400
and um that experience in

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,360
what came to be known as open source

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,400
software uh served sun very well

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
and allowed it to work well with the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
internet community and gain a reputation

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
for being

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,200
uh the conveyor of the spirit

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,480
and practice of the internet that led to

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640
enormous success

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,239
at the end of the 1990s notably in 1995

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
some microsystems released

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,599
uh the java platform and when it did

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
that

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,599
um this was before the coining of the

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,879
term open source and in those days free

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,480
software was still

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,599
something of a of a niche activity

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,680
not least for hobbyists um

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
sun made the java platform happen

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
spectacularly by making its source

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
available in a way that was uh

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
unprecedented and very

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
free indeed i worked at ibm at the time

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
and i remember at ibm we took the source

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
code

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,680
to java and ported it to at least four

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
platforms without ever needing to go and

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
negotiate with sun

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
as would have been the norm before and

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
it was revolutionary to have permission

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
in advance

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
to do those ports even if we didn't

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
actually have permission in advance to

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
then go and

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
distribute and monetize them which would

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,280
later become one of the fundamental

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
differences of the open source movement

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
that

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,519
um being a pioneer and that

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
having created in many ways the internet

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,319
and the workstation industries

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,159
led to some being um very confident to

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,239
the point of arrogance

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,519
and really not treating the open source

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
movement very well and

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
really scorning the linux platform on

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,959
x86

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,319
it is said that every new

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
area moves through pioneers to settlers

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,080
to townsfolk

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,000
and we discover over time that pioneers

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,799
make very poor townsfolk

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,639
and some microsystems uh was not uh i

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,280
didn't find it easy to settle into the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,919
role

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,199
as just another open source community

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,000
member

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
nonetheless sun still did a whole load

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
of open source stuff

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,919
that made a lasting difference to the

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,360
software industry and to the

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,759
open source community when sun

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,600
went open source which it did in 2004

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,800
it went really big now the move towards

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
embracing open source

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
which was coined in 1998 to 1999 started

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,800
right

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,160
right away at sun and from 1999 onwards

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,039
uh under the leadership in particular of

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
uh of denise cooper who coined the term

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,360
open source program office

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
at sun some made a number of visionary

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
and leading open source moves

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
such as donating tomcat and ant to

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
apache

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,840
a lot of people don't remember that

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
tomcat was originally

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,520
sons software when it was donated to

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
apache

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,840
these visionary and leading moves were

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,160
not treated as such

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
by the then open source and free

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,199
software movement

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
and that was largely because sun's

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
resistance to x86 and its resistance to

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
linux

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,960
had led it to be treated as an opponent

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
of open source

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
and its choice of the way to make java

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
succeed

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,840
doing open its own way by making the

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,880
source code freely available for

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
uh study and change but not making it

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
freely available for sharing

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,320
and use by other parties those two facts

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,360
meant that sun had a very bad reputation

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,280
for open source

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
even though it was actually one of the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,199
leading contributors to open source

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,880
um as the company faced some challenges

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
that were the consequence of previous

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,600
bad leadership between

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,440
1999 and 2001

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
the leadership of the company changed

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
and a new chief executive came in

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
and the company made the bold move of

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,840
making open source

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
its core software strategy the the

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
default

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
change to all software shall be open

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,319
source

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
and uh by 2010 uh the open source

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,560
program office at sun

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
which uh i went on to lead in 2004 after

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,880
denise left

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
had opened the entire sun software

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
portfolio

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
including solaris unix including the

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
java platform

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
the identity management system uh all of

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
the development tools and even the

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
source code

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
to the spark silicon chip so this was a

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
load of work to do there was a lot of

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
administration

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,240
and um if you will lubrication necessary

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,720
to make open source happen

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
at that scale so rapidly at some micro

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
systems

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,599
and that was really the reason why an

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,199
open source program office was created

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,919
initially just one person in 2004

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,680
i took a role out of the product areas

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,840
reporting to the cto office

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
and we created an open source program

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,759
office with a program staff

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
and that staff did tremendous work in

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,639
getting all the packages open source

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,759
and also in other actions um

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,039
so what exactly did sons ospo do

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
well the first thing i have to say is

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,160
what it didn't do

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,240
it didn't do license compliance sun's

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
legal department fully understood

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,479
the nature of open source licenses

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
having had to do a lot of open source

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,039
packaging in conjunction with solaris

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,039
already and in particular having had to

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,639
deal with the gpl and free software

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
prior to the coining of the term open

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,160
source so sun's legal

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
department was quite on top of the needs

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
for compliance and created a very

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
effective workflow that didn't need the

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,960
open source program offices

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
uh staff to administer we did

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,479
act as an approver in the workflow but

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,080
we didn't run the process

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
the other thing that the oshpo didn't do

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,479
at sun was any internal evangelism

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
really sun had open sourced in its blood

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,680
it knew what open collaboration

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,280
meant it knew about uh acting first and

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,560
seeking forgiveness afterwards

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,080
uh it was a top-down move from the ceo

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
that made open source our strategy

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,360
didn't need selling to anybody

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,199
and um however we did have to do quite a

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
lot of business model consulting with

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
product groups

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
and well honestly we did have to do

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
quite a bit of internal advocacy

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,080
because quite a lot of the pro the

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
product groups didn't think that open

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
source was a business strategy and were

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
very resistant

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,039
even though the ceo had told them to get

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
off their asses and go do it

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
and um indeed by the time some

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,080
microsystems were shut down in 2010

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
there were still hold out individuals in

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
leadership roles

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
who believed that they could resist open

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
source uh in the industry

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
i some of them went on to work at other

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
companies that they then damaged as well

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
i won't name any names in that so what

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
did sun's open source program office

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,640
actually do

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
well the most important job that we did

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
was to rebuild and sustain

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,760
trust from the open source community

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,200
which have been lost

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,399
uh in a variety of ways by saying bad

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
things about linux

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
by um not embracing open source in the

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,480
open source community's way

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,200
for java by

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
being very opinionated when it came to

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
licensing and code

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,399
and so we decided we would lead with

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
code we would make code open

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,120
we would talk to open source communities

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,720
we would engage in open behavior

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
and i believe that by about 2005 2006

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,920
people did actually believe that sun

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
was an open source company we built

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,600
public communities around sun's

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
technology as the code was made open

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,120
source

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
we built direct communities around

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
projects

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,480
like open solaris and open jdk and we

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
also went to existing communities like

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,040
the apache software foundation

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
and we built communities around sun's

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
projects

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,760
we we started from governance we didn't

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,120
add governance later

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,640
we tried very hard to use uh approaches

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
that were truly open

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
with a view that we would share in the

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,519
market it created

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
rather than control it and to do that we

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,160
had to build a community of practice

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
inside sun

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
we held internal summits uh we

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,279
cultivated

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,320
blogging through blogsutson.com that was

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
really the first

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
corporate blogging platform in the

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,800
industry and also we were

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,519
very present uh we ran the very coolest

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
parties

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,959
and we had the very best swag um a lot

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,880
of the t-shirts that uh sarah donseif

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,720
for from the program office had designed

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,920
were really quite uh

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
stunningly original and innovative we

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
also

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,519
participated in a lot of conferences as

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
peers and we sponsored as well

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,160
we helped sponsor fosdem for example we

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,040
took a whole load of stuff to fosdem and

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
used it

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,600
fundamentally as a tool for getting uh

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
over obstacles and getting java open

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,760
source

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,519
and we made many many code contributions

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
the thing you didn't see was that our

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,360
osbo was watching the body corporate

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
we had uh staff who were part of the pr

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,000
function

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,200
and consequently were entitled to see

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
all the traffic in the

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,880
press office and they gave us early

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,640
warning when bad things like an

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,000
attempted partnership with sco

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,440
were about to happen which that's

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,720
something that we stopped happening as

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
it happens

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
we also had our own uh legal counsel

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
allocated to us and that meant we had

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
eyes inside the legal department

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,160
and we got to know when there were

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
changes happening in products that might

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,880
be harmful to our reputation

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,279
and then we operated from the cto office

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
with a direct reporting line to the ceo

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
and that meant that we had actual

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
authority

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,000
when it came to saying that something

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
should or should not happen

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
we tried not to get in the way we tried

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,240
to let product teams do their thing

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,160
but where there was something really bad

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
going down once or twice it was

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,200
necessary

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,120
to exercise our privilege of being able

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,800
to ask the ceo to intervene

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,240
and stop the bad thing from happening

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,560
here's five things that you might want

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,360
to copy in your osbo that we did at sun

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,519
we ran an ombudsman service uh because

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,079
we had a reputation for opposing open

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
source

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
we wanted to give people the opportunity

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
to tell us that they

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,040
thought we'd done something wrong rather

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,040
than to tell the register first

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,200
and the ombudsman service was a a a

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
private and confidential service where

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,920
you could make a

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,800
confidential report to son and my team

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
would then work

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
on your behalf inside son to get an

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,160
answer or a resolution for you

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,399
that was really quite an effective

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,360
service second thing we did

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,360
was we ran a data sheet wiki we found

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,320
that sun's hardware hangs around forever

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,040
and people who are writing uh drivers or

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,839
open source

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,680
software support for it need data about

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,440
the drivers and the chipsets

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,959
and so as we were able to uh uh

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
extract these from the engineering

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,240
groups we put them on a wiki so that

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
they remain permanently available

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,480
we wrote a lot of frequently asked

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,440
questions and i recommend the faq

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,880
as a tool for coordinating inside a

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
company with an open source program

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
office

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,760
writing an faq allows you to write down

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,959
the hard questions that are impolite

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,639
to make to your vp and then force people

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
to collaborate over answering them

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,160
on the pretext that it's going to be a

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,920
public question whether you

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,079
make the faq public or not doesn't

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
really matter so much as the fact

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
that you have an faq which is driving

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
your pr

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
and your product documentation and uh

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
which

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,760
is answering the questions that need

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,120
answering

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,279
um a couple of things that you might not

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
be able to copy uh we were told at one

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,199
point that we

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,040
had uh some rpc code in the linux kernel

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,519
and we were asked to re-license it which

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,320
we did we were also asked to re-license

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,920
open boot

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,000
so that it could be used by other

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,720
platforms and we did that

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
and we also had um emily suter worked

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,600
very hard to get

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,600
the uh the code for the spark chips

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,320
released under gpl with the complete

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
tool chain and we had fabs in the far

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
east who were making single core spark

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,199
chips

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,800
using our original designs those were

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
just some examples of the way that we

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,519
we tried to be open and the way that we

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,680
tried to work with other communities

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,160
so if you are starting an ospo

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
i encourage you to remember how son did

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,519
it

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,199
we tried to be radically open we tried

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,320
to be transparent and honest with

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,440
communities

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
we let the code do the talking as often

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,880
as possible

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,720
and we tried to make sure that we had

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,639
eyes everywhere in the company

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
to stop our hard work building

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
reputation being destroyed by some other

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,399
organization's strategy i'll be very

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
happy to

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
answer your questions about uh the sun

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,519
ospo

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
there were many other people involved

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
and if you look at the earlier slides

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
there's the url

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
of the blog post that tells you all

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,000
about them and i'll be

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,360
very happy also if you uh decide to

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
sponsor the work that i'm doing

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
unaffiliated with any corporations to

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,600
support and promote open source

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
thank you very much for your attention
