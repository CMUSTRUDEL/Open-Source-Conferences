Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	CLIF is OW2's open source project dedicated to performance testing. It comes with load injectors, for generating traffic upon an extendible number of network protocols, and probes to observe usage of computing and networking resources. In 2019, CLIF was given the "OW2 Market Award" for its ability to address the challenges of testing the performances of Orange's home IoT service. This year, we are proud to present CLIF's new user interface, inspired by latest CLIF utilizations in devops contexts: the CLIF web console.
