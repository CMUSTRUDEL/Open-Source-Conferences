Title: How big money, investors, and greed are putting the future of open source at risk.
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	The changing landscape of the open-source industry has taken a potentially dark turn in the last few years. Instead of focusing on inclusion, innovation, and collaboration a new generation of so called open source drive companies has emerged flush with investor money and looking to maximize the returns for their investors and shareholders at all costs. In an effort to accelerate “revenue” and “profits” these companies are looking to rewrite the definition of what they consider open source. We are in a battle for not only the hearts and minds of the FOSS community but our collective future. As new developers start open source projects more will be compelled to choose more restrictive licensing models ( i.e. SSPL ), invest less in the community, and “control” as much of the code and product as possible. I will talk about the trend, talk about the common business models, and offer a few alternatives.

[Music]

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,720
hi everybody i'm here to talk to you

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,560
about

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,240
big money and how it's putting open

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
source at risk

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,760
let me start with a quick introduction

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,599
um my name

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
is matt yankovic i am the head of open

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,480
source strategy or the haas for short at

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
percona

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
you can reach me on twitter at

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
emyonkovit or

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
email me at hoss procona.com if you have

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
questions or want to talk further about

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,440
these topics

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
so i wanted to start with this quote

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
from steven spielberg everyone loves a

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,719
winner but

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,879
nobody loves a winner and this is never

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
more true than in the business space

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,920
everyone wants to copy a winner everyone

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,520
wants

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
you know to chase those people who are

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,600
successful even those

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
that start out hating one another think

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
about microsoft microsoft

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
famously came out back in the 90s and

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,400
said that linux is a cancer

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,119
and open source is bad for business

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
right

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
it was something that there was a lot of

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
hate and even today

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
you know people still remember those but

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
if you look at microsoft today

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
open source has been a winner and

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,240
microsoft has jumped on the bandwagon

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
it's similar across the industry people

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,960
love open source because it's a winner

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
but this means it is a very dangerous

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
time for open source

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
because you're looking at people who are

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
imitating but don't have the same

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
philosophies

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
that a lot of us who got into the open

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,640
source space started with

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,159
so let's take a look at that so when we

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
talk about the big risk

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
it's really driven by commercial open

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
source software

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
and the big risk that i see here starts

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
with who

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
this software is being built for when

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
you think about your project

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
something that you started with

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
something that's near and dear to your

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,479
heart

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,159
you start by thinking who is it being

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,360
developed for maybe you're developing it

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
for the world

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
maybe you're developing it for maybe

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,680
your local community maybe people who

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,119
think like you or act like you or use

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
the same software as you

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,599
have the same issues or maybe you're

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,239
looking at a certain specific set of

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
users

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
there are people you want to reach

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,640
people you want to help okay

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
but most commercial open source software

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120
right now is being built for

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
shareholders okay this isn't necessarily

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
a bad thing but it makes you have to

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,080
wonder

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
what they're going to do and how they're

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
going to proceed with you know the

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
future

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
of their decision making process around

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
open source

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,680
and the success for a shareholder is

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,519
very different than a lot of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
those that are in the community or those

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
that started

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
the project right if you think about the

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
different sides of success

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
they have different outcomes one is very

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160
for-profit the other one's very for the

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
good of

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
the community or the world and part of

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,920
the challenge is a classic open source

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,239
model for businesses is very difficult

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,840
i can go into the details at nauseam but

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
i only have 15 minutes here so i'm going

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
to keep it short

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,680
so when i say it's not easy i've been in

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,720
the open source business for over 20

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
years now

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
and you know when you look at what

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
drives open source companies what

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
you know uh you know makes them

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
profitable okay

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
you have to remember that open source as

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,360
a movement

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,280
you know in a lot of people's minds who

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,080
are buying who are consuming it

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
it changes how they buy we did a survey

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
this past year and almost

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
two-thirds of companies who use open

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,280
source prefer not to pay so if you're

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
building an open source company

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
the large majority of your users don't

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
want to pay

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,400
and the third of those

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
that do pay right so you already cut

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
down from two thirds to a third now a

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
third

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
of those that are paid are only paying

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,239
for insurance and support

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,959
so they want you know to get it just

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
you know because hey maybe something bad

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
happens and you hope that you'll never

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,360
use it and

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,239
these types of things enable you know

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,400
companies the

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,159
the profits the sales you know the these

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
types of support contracts enable a lot

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,680
of companies to be in business but if

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,519
people are predisposed never to use them

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
never to want them they don't have as

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
much value as

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,239
you know quote unquote proprietary

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
software licenses

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,759
and that makes retention rates often in

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,120
open source companies a big problem

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
especially those that are focused on the

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,240
service side of things

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,840
and anytime that you start to move

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
towards a more commercial model there's

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,759
always risk that you're going to get

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
forked

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
there's always risk that people are

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,280
going to go away if they don't

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,880
see you know the impact of your

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,000
software and if they don't see the value

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
and if they're only buying it for

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
support

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
if they never have that support need

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,919
eventually they're not going to see a

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
need to pay for it

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,600
now in the space we're in we have extra

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
challenges i'm in the database space

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
databases are uncool so not only do you

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
have the open source stuff you have

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
you know the challenges with people not

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
wanting to pay and it's not a cool space

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,800
to pay for stuff

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
but when you look at how this all kind

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
of started

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
you know go back to mysql which is one

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,400
of the original ogs or old

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,720
you know companies that that kind of set

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
the benchmark for exits

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
okay and you know big money in the open

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
source space

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,120
and again everyone wants to copy this

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
success

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,360
so open source now became this

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
legitimate business model

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,600
it became something that

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,720
was that transcended if you will

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,280
um you know just being that movement

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
and now open source is really the rule

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,919
this

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
you know is a quote from an article uh

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,840
you know on linux foundation

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,720
you know it has become that de facto

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,639
standard where

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,280
people are now looking first to develop

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,000
open source but they're not doing it

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
as a community effort they're not doing

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
it as

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
a means to help the world or move things

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,639
forward

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,440
a lot of them are using it as a

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,800
marketing investment or a way to

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
you know push uh you know future

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
monetization

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
you know generate a freemium model if

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
you will

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,880
and that's because how investors think

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,600
is they they get excited by adoption

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,440
right and so they look at an open source

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
project and they look at oh my god look

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
at the number of

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,319
downloads they have look at the number

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
of you know

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
uh issues that people have opened look

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
at the number of people who have

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,440
contributed

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600
and they look at those user numbers and

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,520
their eyes bug out they get really big

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
and then they think you know but these

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
guys don't know how to monetize this

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
they don't know how to turn this into a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,160
quote-unquote real business

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,360
and so they try to find out how to take

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
what you started

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
as a project something that has been

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
driven by the community for the

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,080
betterment of the world

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
and they think how can i monetize this

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
thing and so they do

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
and so they start to invest in different

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
areas

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,120
including things that hey we need

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
stickiness

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,199
which is a fun way of saying kind of

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,000
locking you in

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,000
and there is this fine line between

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
stickiness and lock-in

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
but ideally what you you know need

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,520
if you want to be true to the open

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,160
source roots is stickiness

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,000
by treating customers and users right

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
and showing them a lot of value

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,199
but it's not easy to do that so a lot of

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,160
investors go into the stickiness that is

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,000
quote unquote lock-in right um you know

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
when you start using something

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
and you can't get out of it right you

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
don't want to be in the hotel california

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,599
space you don't want to be locked in and

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
can never leave

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,680
and this is where a lot of big open

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,080
source or quote unquote open source

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,639
companies you know have chosen to play

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,759
if you look at for instance mongodb

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
uh their ceo famously said we did not

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
open source for

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
any sort of community reasons we open

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
sourced because we wanted the freemium

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
strategy we wanted to drive adoption we

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
wanted

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,080
to drive dollars and you know investors

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
love this

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
and they love that login angle you know

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
this is a quote that i've used several

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,919
times before

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
you know you you talk about analysts

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,199
they

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
they praise stickiness in the open

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,080
source database space they praise the

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,639
stickiness

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
that has generated because they

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,599
they actually say

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
most companies tend to stick to their

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,919
database vendor over time

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,440
even if the vendor raised prices and

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,280
they say this is a great model

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
just look at how wonderful oracle was in

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,560
the 90s

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
i don't know about you but in the tech

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
space oracle was not great for me in the

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,599
90s maybe it was for shareholders

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,519
again not generated for the users

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
and as you start to look at these

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
companies and these

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,360
investment dollars that come in a lot of

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
that change a lot of that focus on

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
driving business and additional dollars

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
is based on the management team if you

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
go look at

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
the big companies that have been

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
changing their licensing and going more

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
away

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
from open source look at where the

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
pedigree of their management and

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
executive teams come from

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,000
there isn't a lot of open source

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
companies

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
in this list because you know what they

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
don't

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,959
want revenue from an open source company

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
they want revenue from a big proprietary

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,360
company

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,640
but x amount more based on that open

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,320
source adoption

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,880
so you get people coming from the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
oracles or the vms or the linkedins or

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,480
the

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,399
you know ibm's or the you know bonds

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
citrix you know you know all these

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
different companies

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,360
that have driven you know uh traditional

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,880
business models and try to overlay that

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
into the open source space

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
and that erodes what was originally a

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
community driven play

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,279
and what's funny is if you look

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,279
specifically in the database base

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,480
these companies that even as they've

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,720
made these changes

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
they're trying to become more profitable

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,959
because the tricks that worked

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,640
in the traditional business models in

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
the traditional spaces

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,320
for open source or for proprietary

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
companies aren't working here

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
so they are chasing and throwing dollars

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
away

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,360
at trying to become profitable okay

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
they make a lot of money a lot of sales

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
but you know they are

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,839
continuing to evolve and try and come up

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,920
with a profitable business model

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
i like to call this the you know from

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
the shareholder perspective it's the

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
eventual

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
profitability model just like a ventral

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
consistency

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
right seems kind of like a fitting model

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
i guess right

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
that you know uh you know the databases

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
companies would follow that as well

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
but this has generated this whole

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,640
licensing whack-a-mole if you will

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
right and so you want to have a company

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,600
that

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,480
can have quote-unquote stickiness or

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
that can

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
you know make people want to you know

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,519
purchase support or software

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,600
so you start with that gpl and if you

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
contribute or change it well then you

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
have to contribute it back so everyone

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
benefits

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,839
oh well the cloud came along and kind of

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
disrupted that because the cloud doesn't

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,760
actually distribute it so oh we're going

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
to create the agpl

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,440
oh it didn't really work that much

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
database as a service software as a

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
service continue to grow

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,200
okay let's go sspl let's you know do

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
anti-cloud type licensing

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
and so you have this whack-a-mole that

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,519
continues to happen you have this

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,519
constant change for the sake of change

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
but this doesn't exist just here this is

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,279
a classic business model

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
and when you look at classic business

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
models you can apply the classic

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,440
business model

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
you know issues and problems and kind of

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
angst

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
towards what's happened in the open

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,320
source space you don't believe me let's

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,440
talk about ice cream

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
okay now um in you know the us

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
specifically but i think everywhere in

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,320
the world you probably have seen the

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
mcdonald's ice cream cone machine and

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
there was this great article

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,680
just in april of this year about

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,519
mcdonald's ice cream machines and the

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,079
quote-unquote lock-in that happens with

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
them

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,399
it turns out that when you have a

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
mcdonald's franchise you have to buy the

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,200
ice cream machine from one place

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,000
and that one place dictates all of the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
rules

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,639
anytime there's a problem with machine

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,399
you have to call them you can never fix

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
it yourself you can't do anything

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
without calling that vendor someone

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
actually found that there was a secret

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,800
code

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,320
to get into the ice cream machine and

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,959
fix the problems without having to call

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
a vendor

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
so that way customers didn't have to

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
wait for the vendor to come along and

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
fix those issues

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
you know what happened well mcdonald's

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
threatened lawsuits they threatened

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,720
all kinds of legal action against the

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,760
people who found that code and anyone

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,279
who used it

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,760
because they had an immense business

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,079
working with this vendor there was a lot

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
of money flowing back and forth

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
by having that unique proprietary

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,079
contract

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,959
and that's the type of way that people

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,959
are looking at

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,720
open source how do we lock people and

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,120
how do we protect

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
our you know rights to fix this because

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
if we are the only ones who can fix this

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,680
if we're the only ones who can

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
distribute this if we're the only ones

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
who can make changes and features

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
then you know what we can benefit more

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,880
than everyone else

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,720
and that's where we're in this super

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,519
dangerous time

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
the term open source is really being

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
hijacked

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,079
it's being hijacked by a lot of

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,800
different people and you know

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
contributors are not being treated like

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
the

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,519
you know awesome people that they are

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you know how long are they going to want

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,560
to continue

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
to contribute if their code continually

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
be

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
you know is placed under proprietary

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,600
licenses or not fully open

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,519
or they're dictated to on how they can

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
use the code that they've contributed

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,160
and who owns it and as we get into the

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
next generation of developers

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
these developers are starting to think

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,199
that these freemium models these

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,519
you know half open source models are

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,560
the new standard the new de facto way

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,399
for people to

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
develop software so the next generation

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
of open source software won't be open at

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
all

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
and you know the issue is as long as

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,120
there's money out there and you know

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,320
potential

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
you know there's going to be these

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
changes and there's going to be this

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
erosion on what we classically call the

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,440
freedom of open source

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
and as soon as that money starts to shut

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,399
down you know what

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
investors are going to pull out even if

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
there are good ideas

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
and this is going to potentially really

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
hurt the industry as a whole

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,079
and you know not only that we're already

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
seeing the erosion of innovation across

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,160
the industry

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
now it's ironic that a lot of open

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,000
source software

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,839
um you know is what is used to develop

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
these new proprietary softwares if

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,880
lucine was released spl elastic wouldn't

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
exist so i leave you with this thought

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
right

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,320
we've got two battles going on here in

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
the open source base just like this

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
cherokee proverb

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,639
okay there's two wolves that are

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
battling one another one is jealousy

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,440
greed

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
anger evilness the other one's good it's

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
joy it's peace it's sharing it's

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,639
it's this great thing which one's going

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,639
to win and it's whichever one we feed

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,959
so however we treat the open source

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,199
community however we build our

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,839
software that's what's going to win

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
thank you

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
