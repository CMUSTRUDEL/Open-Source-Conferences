Title: Open source in the strategy of a Communication Service Provider
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Lessons learnt these last 20 years show the incredible success of the "digital companies", that is to say companies that develop themselves the applications that are at the core of their business, and that do it based upon open source. In this sense, "digital companies" are not limited to companies delivering only digital services, but include companies manufacturing physical goods or moving goods or people. Telcos represent an interesting paradox. Core business of a Telco consist obviously in the applications running its network. However, due to history, due to the time when software and hardware were bundled into non-dissociable systems, the sharing of core applications between Telcos has not been done by means of open source, but via a small number of vendors, the Alcatel, Ericsson, Nokia or Huawai. Could this situation evolve in the future ?

[Music]

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,119
hello

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,119
good afternoon

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,119
does a company push for open source with

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,240
the same intensity

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,760
in all directions or

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,520
should certain types of applications

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,360
be privileged candidates for open source

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
this is probably a question that is

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,760
frequently being asked in many companies

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
and there is today no definite answer to

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,960
this question

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,760
however i want to share with you today

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
four examples based upon my own

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
experience

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,239
in the telecommunications company at

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,640
telco

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,520
these are four examples where the

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,719
company

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,840
is not only using open source but

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,280
very significantly contributing back

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
to the open source community my name is

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
irve paco

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
until a few months ago i was in charge

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,200
of open source governance and promotion

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,560
in a telco first example

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,520
is onap onop is about

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
managing the core network it is at the

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,840
heart

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,960
of the 5g so it is quite natural

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,079
to find tail cores involved here with

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
the objective

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,040
to structure the ecosystem

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,520
this is merely the continuation

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
of all work that has been done in

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,159
normalization bodies

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,159
such as itu international

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
telecommunications union

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,040
3gpp gsma hc

00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,560
etc etc only that now

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,560
the project is being hosted by the linux

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,520
foundation what is worth

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
being mentioned though is the role

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,720
played by the telecommunications

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,480
equipment manufacturers

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,720
historically telecommunications systems

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
were not developed by the telcos

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
themselves

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,879
but by the alcatel the nokia direction

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
or the huawei

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,760
it seems that the virtualization

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,680
is not really changing the paradigm onap

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,080
is not developing solutions

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,760
but only specification and semi-finished

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,680
products that still

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,800
have to be integrated into solutions

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,239
so it will be interesting to observe

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,200
whether the telcos do develop themselves

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
some of these solutions based upon the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,080
on-app outputs

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,840
or whether they will still entirely

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,519
rely on the traditional equipment

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,959
manufacturers

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,400
second example is about geographic

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,159
information system a geographic

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,840
information system

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,080
is very important for a lot of

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
industries

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
that go well beyond telecommunications

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
such as

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,400
energy transport tourism government

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,599
e-commerce etc the qgis

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
project was developed by orange and

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,080
presented

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,599
here in this audible 2 conference

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,440
one year ago it is an important

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,239
project the application is supporting

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,000
all the building and maintenance of

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,599
radio antennas copper

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,319
and fibers in orange france

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,120
these physical pieces of equipment

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,000
probably

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
represent the most important share in

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,920
the technical assets of the company

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,239
20 000 orange employees are using daily

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,599
this application

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,959
here the objective of orange

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,840
was not to structure the ecosystem as it

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120
was with an

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,919
app it was merely to get a better

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,639
control

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,199
over the functions and incidentally

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,840
lower

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,720
the cost so it was mainly opportunistic

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,919
the legacy proprietaries geographic

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,199
solution

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,800
was not good orange had no visibility of

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
the roadmap of the product

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
could not influence it and the time to

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,440
fix bugs

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,320
was for too long the

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,639
release of the new simulation entirely

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,680
based upon open source technologies

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,560
was met with much enthusiasm

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,680
by the users it is worth mentioning that

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
orange is not only consuming lines of

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,520
code

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
produced by others but orange also makes

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
contributions back

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,520
to the kyushi's open source community

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,639
in order to avoid creating technical

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,960
depth so there is clearly

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
an engagement by a range

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:27,600
third example is about the business

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,320
support system the bss

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
in a telecommunications company this

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
includes

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,520
the crm the billing the provisioning of

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,880
services

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
etc one of the big challenges of the

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
telcos

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,400
is the complexity of their i.t

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,039
historically fixed communications and

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,919
mobile

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,000
communications have often been developed

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,479
in different business units

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
supported by different information

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,080
systems

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,039
likewise the online marketing of

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,440
telecommunications services

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
could have been developed with its own

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
information system

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
different from the information system

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,840
supporting physical

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,080
sales outlets often also

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
telcos have been developed through

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,400
acquisitions

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,600
so in order to ensure true multi-channel

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,880
and multi-service the information system

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,720
architecture

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,360
of the telcos must be simplified

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,400
the reference framework for this new

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
architecture

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
has been published by the tm forum and

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,000
is called

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,120
oda open digital architecture

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,160
framework oda

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,680
divides the traditional bss

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,280
into three blocks called party

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,240
core commerce and engagement

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,520
these three blocks should be neatly

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
separated

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,319
and interrelated with standardized

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,280
apis this is the condition

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,080
to ensure multi-service and

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,599
multi-channel

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
the tm forum launched the open source

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,400
development

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,360
of the oda component accelerator

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,680
as a proof of concept for this new

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,720
architecture

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,360
in this case like in on up

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
the goal of the telcos who participate

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
to the project

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
is not to develop their own information

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
system

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,960
but to structure the ecosystem

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
the telcos want to put pressure on the

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
traditional software publishers

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
the salesforce velocity undocks

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
microsoft

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
so that these software publishers do

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
implement

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,080
the standardized tmf apis in their

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
solutions

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,639
fourth example is about software

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,280
asset management traditionally

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
the pricing model of a software

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,240
publisher

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,639
is based upon the number of servers upon

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
which

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,840
their application has been deployed

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,639
with virtualization comes a problem

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,520
since an application could be running on

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
any

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
of the many servers of the cloud

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
the natural tendency of the software

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,959
publishers

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,039
is to stick to legacy pricing

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,440
schemes which would automatically result

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,560
in a very significant increase of the

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,240
total amount

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,279
of the invoice optism

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,839
objective is to provide a tool

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,200
that makes it possible to implement an

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,240
alternative

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,080
more reasonable pricing scheme based

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
upon usage metrics

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
that would be recognized as valid both

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,440
by users

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,959
and by software publishers optism has

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,519
been developed by orange

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:13,600
and is being published as open source

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,959
so in this example of optism

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,720
like in the on up and the oda

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:26,080
example the goal is strategic

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,080
it is to structure an ecosystem

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,519
let us sum up now

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,720
in a company the goal the engagement

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
in favor of open source could vary from

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
one project

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
to the other in some projects the

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,120
company

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,160
may contribute back to the community

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,440
in other projects the company may

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
merely consume lines of code produced by

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
others

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,839
in some projects like yugi's

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,560
the goal is purely opportunistic

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
but in other projects like three

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,760
projects we mentioned the goal

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
could be strategic

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,800
what seems important to me

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
is that two of these strategic projects

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,880
the business support system and the

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,000
software asset management projects

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,600
were indeed initiated by

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
telecommunications company

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,279
but the open source technologies that

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,560
have been developed

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,760
could be of interest for many companies

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,320
well beyond the telecommunications

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
industry

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:47,839
thank you very much for your attention

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,839
and talk to you on the chat

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,160
