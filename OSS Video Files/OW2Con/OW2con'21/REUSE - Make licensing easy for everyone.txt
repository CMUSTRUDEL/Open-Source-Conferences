Title: REUSE - Make licensing easy for everyone
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Why is it so hard to detect the licensing and copyright information of source code? Because it is a tedious and often confusing task for developers to provide this information. The REUSE project changes that! With three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines. This presentation will guide you through the REUSE best practices and presents how to make clear licensing simple.

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,880
[Music]

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199
do

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
hello everyone and thank you for

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,920
attending this presentation about

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
reuse my name is max mill i work for the

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,080
free software foundation europe

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,279
the fsfe and we are a charity that

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,760
empowers users to control technology

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,399
well free software free software is

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,040
basically

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,480
all about licenses that give people the

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
four freedoms to use

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
study share and improve software and

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
licenses are

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,840
a legal thing that not only lawyers or

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,239
legal experts have to take care of

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
but also developers so those who create

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,559
software

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,079
users and also re-users of existing free

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,719
software

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,399
and because licenses tend to be get some

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
a little bit complicated

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,479
and as well as copyright we created

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
reuse

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,479
reuse is there to make licensing easy

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,799
for everyone

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,640
so let's take a look at a example

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,360
project very simple

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,159
so we have a c file there and a few

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,640
other text files and also two images

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,240
and now you as a free software developer

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
would like to make sure that this is

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,119
free software and the people understand

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
that it is so so what people

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,000
traditionally or often do

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
is they just add one file called license

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,320
you see it here

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,600
and inside of this license file there is

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,159
the license text

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
of the license that you've chosen this

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
could be

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,320
mit apache any of the gpl family

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,079
but from the outside you don't know so

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
you would have to look inside of this

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,600
text file

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,759
or have some heuristics or some tools

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,880
that tell you which is inside of there

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,759
which license now this

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,040
might work if you only have one license

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,360
in your repository

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
so basically all files are under one

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,000
license so under one

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,280
set of conditions for reuse now

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,400
what happens if in this example you have

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
two binary files so two images that are

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
from a third party

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
so perhaps under a different license

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,920
from different copyright holder

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,040
how do you do that and here it becomes

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,440
really complicated

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
so if you search on the internet you

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,720
will find

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,040
numerous guides how to do that like

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
having multiple license files and

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,239
with different naming schemes and some i

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
have a centrify where you list like the

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,640
third-party

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,680
copyrights and licenses but overall this

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
is really tricky

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
for humans and really tricky for

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,720
machines to

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
fetch the license and copyright

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
information of such a project

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
and as i said that's why we created

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,560
reuse

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
because we saw a number of issues with

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
licensing

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,640
i quickly go over it so often it's the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
case that we don't have information

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,640
about the license and the copyright of

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
either your own software that you

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
already have

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,760
or third party code that you would like

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,080
to use or reuse

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
and those people who reuse your code

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
overlook

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
often overlook the licenses that you or

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
others have chosen

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,040
for all files in a repository or just

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
individual files

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,200
and then as i said in the in the

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
beginning it's quite complicated how to

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
do with multiple licenses

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
so you have a creative commons and an

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,959
apache license

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
how to deal with that you often have

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
license ambiguity

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
so multiple versions of a gpl with

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
exceptions and so on

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,120
and all contributors no matter whether

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
in a company or in a free software

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
project

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,599
they need some kind of training or

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
documentation and if they switch

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
companies or

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
projects and work multiple ones that

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,280
becomes really

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
complex and confusing and for all of

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,519
these things

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
they have been conflicting best

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
practices but

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
most of them were not really sufficient

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,519
for all the

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,680
edge cases now

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
we thought about how can we make

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
licensing and copyright easier for

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
everyone

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
and out of this thought process in 2017

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
we created

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,799
reuse we use has a number of basic

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,359
principles

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,600
or ideas so we want to make it easy to

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,240
find copyright and licensing information

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,040
for every single file and repository and

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
by every single file we mean that

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
we want to avoid silos by storing the

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
information about copyright and

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
licensing

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,199
directly inside of the repository as

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
clear text

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,120
so no databases no

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
web services where that can go offline

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,400
so but directly as close as possible to

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
the files as

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,280
possible the information should be

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,160
readable by humans and machines so also

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
tools

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
and we did not want to reinvent the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,600
wheel but be compatible with existing

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,240
efforts that solve parts of the issues

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,160
and overall we want to make a licensing

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
fun and easy for developers

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
so those people who actually create code

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,199
and this should work for

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
all project sizes so for big teams for

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
many files but also for

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
small repositories and projects like

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,960
we've seen before

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,800
now reuse exists or contains of three

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
simple steps

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
in the first step we choose and provide

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
licenses

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,120
so we pick a license and store the

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
license text somehow where it can be

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,479
found

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
in the second step we attach the

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
information about copyright and

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
licensing

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,520
to every single file in this repository

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
and the third step is quite simple

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
we confirm the wheels compliance and now

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,440
we'll go

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,600
quickly quickly go through the the whole

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
process so we'll you will understand

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,440
what happens inside of there so

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
first step choose and provide licenses

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,759
so we asked

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
code developers creators to think hard

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
about the license that they want to

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,080
choose because basically that's

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,639
their conditions for reuse by others and

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
we ask them to save the license text

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
inside of a directory that's called

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,759
licenses

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,560
so we don't have this license or copying

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,639
file

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
but we have a dedicated place where to

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
store licensed texts

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
and rename them after an spdx license

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
identifier

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
so spdx is a cool project that came up

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
initially

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
with a number of unique license

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
identifiers for all those licenses or

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
many of them

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,680
that are out there so in this case we

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,880
have a project

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
with a c file and our first license as a

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
gpl

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,000
3.0 or any later version so here we

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,039
start in licenses directory

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,599
now comes the second step we have to add

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,280
information about copyright and

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
licensing

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,400
ideally as a comment in the header of

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,440
the files

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,639
and for this we have two tags the first

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,759
is the spdx license identifier tag

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,880
so as we've seen with the gpl license

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,919
identifier in the in the last slide

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,400
um we have here in the in the example uh

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,360
below

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,039
we have the gpl 3.0 or later so by this

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,400
we say this file is under this

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,120
license and in this case we have two

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,280
copyright holders so we can either use

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
the spdx file copyright text

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
so that's a pretty nice tag that can

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
easily be found by tools

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,160
but also the more traditional copyright

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
fields or comments so in this case we

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,599
have jane doe

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,080
and foobar as copyright holders

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
now what do you do if the license or if

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,160
the file cannot be

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,479
edited directly like we've seen before

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,759
with those two image files

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,319
in this case our first suggestion is

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,160
to create a separate dot license file so

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
this is a simple text file

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
that contains the information about the

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,919
file

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,479
with the same name basically just

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,759
redacted by dot license

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,120
in this case cad.jpg has is under

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,960
cc by 4.0 license and we have the create

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,440
artist as a copyright holder

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
now what do you do if you have a

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,599
directory with

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,319
many binary files inside of there so

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
500 icons of course you could create a

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
dot license file for each of them

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
but of course that would duplicate the

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,000
number of files inside of there

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,560
so for this we offer the depth 5 file

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,479
and this can be stored inside of a dot

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,320
reuse directory

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,720
step 5 is a format by the dbm project

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,120
and in the down in the example below you

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
can see that all files inside of the img

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
folder

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959
are under copyright of great artist and

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,760
the ccbi 4.0 license

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,760
so pretty easy

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,120
the last step here we ask people to

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,800
install the reuse helper tool

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,240
so that's pretty nice python tool

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,480
simple to use simply to install and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
the most fundamental command there is

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
the lint command

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,080
so we run reuse lint and this does check

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,800
for every single file in a repository

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
whether there's

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,399
in some way information about copyright

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
and licenses

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,600
available and rather the licensed text

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,120
files are available as well

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,240
and in this case the project with

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,080
six files is fully reuse compliant

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
and the example we've seen in the first

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
place may look like this

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
so we have for the cad and the doc jpeg

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
files

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,200
we have a dot license file we have a

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
number of license text inside of there

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
and well the other files inside of there

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
have the information about their

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
copyright and license

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
directly attached inside of the file as

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
a comment

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,240
now over the course of the year we use

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,880
developed a lot of components

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
or elements and of course the first

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,279
thing is the specification

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,200
so the best practices themselves and

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,640
this is quite easy to read still

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,480
and it's ready to be integrated by

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
communities and industry so this is

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,399
quite formalized but to lower the

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
threshold because as i said we want to

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,320
make it easy and fun for developers

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,360
we created a tutorial and an faq

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,279
so these form a really low entry barrier

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
and also answer basic questions about

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,560
licensing and copyright

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,440
so not only about reuse itself

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,680
then we have the set helper tool and it

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,360
doesn't only check for reuse compliance

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
but also helps in adding this

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,399
information to existing files

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
it can also output a spdx bill of

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
material so for those who are interested

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
in that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
and another element is the api

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,519
it's basically reuse as a service you

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
could say and by this

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
people can simply register their public

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,640
git repository

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,800
and enter it there register it

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,040
and have a quick check about the real

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
status of this repository

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,640
and they can generate a dynamic batch

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
and this batch they can add to the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
readme file

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,560
so that also people can see whether

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,560
they're rears compliant or not

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
so if you're interested in learning more

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,800
about reuse and

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
applying it you could first start with

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
signing up the email

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
list that we have and participate in the

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,640
discussions

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,720
so we are quite friendly community and

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
many of the things how we use develops

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,880
are also discussed there

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
then you could make one of your projects

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
wheels compliant of course

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
so as you've seen that's quite simple

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
and for this

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,560
we've launched in june reuse booster so

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,079
go to reals.software

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,240
booster and this project is

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,680
there that people that free software

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,639
projects can apply and get

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,839
help from our legal experts of the fsfe

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,079
so we help them

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
to become reuse compliant of course they

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
could do it themselves

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,079
but sometimes you need a little hand a

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,120
little help from a friend

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
and we give them a hand

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,480
then if you represent a community you

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,760
could integrate reuse into your

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,320
policies or guidelines so this for

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
example did the kde community and for

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
them

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,000
each new project they ask them to become

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
reals compliant

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,680
of course if we are developer you could

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,959
also contribute code to reuse

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,320
itself so all our tools like the api the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
helper tool

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
their free software and publicly

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,720
available so

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,839
feel free to go to the website and

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,920
create an issue or even a pull request

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,480
but most importantly please help others

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,320
to understand and adopt reuse

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
share it inside of your community into

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
your company

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,519
your friends that would be really great

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,680
because reuse really is

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,120
so effective if more people use it

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,920
because then code can be

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,040
reused easily by others and the creation

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,440
of code

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,800
is quite simple and this makes free

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,160
software development

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,240
finally a little bit more fun and easy

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,320
so thank you very much i look forward to

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,920
discussion and your questions

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
and if you need more information please

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:28,079
go to reuse dot software

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,079
