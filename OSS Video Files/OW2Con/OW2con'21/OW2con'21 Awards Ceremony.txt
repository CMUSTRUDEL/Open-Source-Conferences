00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
market and technology

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,120
the community award is a recognition of

community

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,840
and open the project to third-party

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,680

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
the market award goes to project with

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,239
significant market adoption

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,240
and significant commercial achievements

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
and the technology awards encourages

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
projects leveraging

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,119
integrating state-of-the-art or

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,240
leading-edge technologies

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,200
so without further ado let's start with

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,200
the community award

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,720
this project was created single-handedly

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,200
by one developer to share his work

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,920
as the project proved useful to others

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,439
it became

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,240
more and more popular

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280
as an example an application based on

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
the project was

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,759
launched in 20 in 2009

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
and is now translated in 27 languages

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,320
and

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
earned more than 700 stars on github

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,920
so for this outstanding achievement

to this award uh uh based on

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,280
on one uh important project also that we

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,560
we had then last year which is for the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,160
lenovo and i wanted to bring in clemo

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,000
one of our account manager

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,600

these projects uh

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
are doing because without these

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,840
customers we would not be

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,120

projects that go that go successfully

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
and for for last year indeed we had

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
quite an experience with lenovo

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,560
migrating them from a support platform

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,960
used by around 7 000 users

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
daily uh to a solution that is based in

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,000
exwiki

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,160
so we got to work with them during about

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
three months in order to to do this uh

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759

and this technology award goes

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,000
right and this project is a high-tech

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,560
product

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,080
developed by a global community using

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
widely accepted quality

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
standards backed by both industry and

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
governments

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
it's written in c and lua and it has

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,680
an objective of long-term

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,880
maintainability

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
and the developers guarantee that it

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,860

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,800
and work in 20 years time from now

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,960
[Music]

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
so for this exceptional realization the

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
other two best

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,950
technology awards goes to

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,919
zen room

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:40,080
[Music]

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:43,520
and i think we have andre argentino

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,360
online with us andrea if you could

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,919
turn your camera on and you're welcome

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
yes thank you very much i was busy

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
typing my name in the chat so that

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,599
people can see who i

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
am thank you very much for uh for being

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
here

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
would be much nicer if we had a chance

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
to meet him personally which i hope is

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
going to happen next year

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,560
uh briefly about zen room it's

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,680
a we call it

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
crypto virtual machine it's a virtual

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
machine

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:20,240
in the sense of java so it executes

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,879
code in a completely sealed environment

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,440
it is centered on cryptography

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,039
we have implemented several

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
cryptographic flows

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,000
we have just released the paper that

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,800
allows

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,240
people to do multi multi-party

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,760
computation

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,120
or a multi signature

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,240
um it's a completely

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,360
multi-platform so it runs on any

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
any devices you could think of and it's

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
true

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,000
since it's written in c and it has no

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,880
external dependencies

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,279
we guarantee it will run in at least for

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,040
20 years so for as long as there will be

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,160
a c compiler the software will run

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,120
nice very very impressive and we're very

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,120
proud to give you

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,320
