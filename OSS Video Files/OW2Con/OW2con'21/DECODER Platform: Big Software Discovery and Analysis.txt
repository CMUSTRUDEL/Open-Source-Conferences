Title: DECODER Platform: Big Software Discovery and Analysis
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	The DECODER open source platform combines information from different sources to share big software knowledge between developers, testers and maintainers. This centralized knowledge contains very heterogeneous documents (code, comments, documentation, formal specifications, tests and static analysis reports, etc.). A set of NLP-based tools is trained to extract relevant semantic information and find correspondences between the documents, either to provide accurate code summarization or to generate a formal view of a plain-text document, which can then be fed to code analyzers.
