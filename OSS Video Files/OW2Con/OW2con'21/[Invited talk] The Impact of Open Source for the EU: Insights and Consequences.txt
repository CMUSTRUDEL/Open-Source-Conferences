Description: 
	In 2020, a study was commissioned by the European Commission’s DG CONNECT to analyse the economic impact of Open Source Software (OSS) and Hardware (OSH) on the European economy. It is estimated that companies located in the European Union (EU) invested around €1 billion in OSS in 2018, resulting in an impact on the European economy between €65 and €95 billion. The analysis estimates a cost-benefit ratio of above 1:4 and predicts that an increase of 10% of OSS contributions generates around additional 0.4% to 0.6% GDP per year as well as more than 600 additional ICT start-ups per year in the EU. Case studies revealed that the public sector could not only reduce the total cost of ownership by procuring OSS instead of proprietary software, but more importantly avoid vendor lock-in, thus increasing its digital autonomy. However, the scale of Europe’s institutional capacity related to OSS is disproportionately smaller than the scale of the value created by OSS. The study therefore recommends a number of specific public policy recommendations aimed at achieving a digitally autonomous public sector, open R&D enabling European growth and a digitised and internally competitive industry.
