Title: [Invited talk] The Impact of Open Source for the EU: Insights and Consequences
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	In 2020, a study was commissioned by the European Commission’s DG CONNECT to analyse the economic impact of Open Source Software (OSS) and Hardware (OSH) on the European economy. It is estimated that companies located in the European Union (EU) invested around €1 billion in OSS in 2018, resulting in an impact on the European economy between €65 and €95 billion. The analysis estimates a cost-benefit ratio of above 1:4 and predicts that an increase of 10% of OSS contributions generates around additional 0.4% to 0.6% GDP per year as well as more than 600 additional ICT start-ups per year in the EU. Case studies revealed that the public sector could not only reduce the total cost of ownership by procuring OSS instead of proprietary software, but more importantly avoid vendor lock-in, thus increasing its digital autonomy. However, the scale of Europe’s institutional capacity related to OSS is disproportionately smaller than the scale of the value created by OSS. The study therefore recommends a number of specific public policy recommendations aimed at achieving a digitally autonomous public sector, open R&D enabling European growth and a digitised and internally competitive industry.

[Music]

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
good morning everybody i'd like to

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,720
welcome you to my presentation on the

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,600
impact of open source for

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,960
the european union which is the outcome

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,880
of a study

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
on behalf of tg connect we have

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
conducted

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,679
together with the team at open from

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,800
europe uh

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,120
and my colleagues at fraunhofer isi

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,840
i'm the project manager of the of this

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
project

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
and we have conducted the following

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
steps

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,360
in order to come to our results that

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,520
means we started with a very

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,160
broad review of the literature and also

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,160
collected data

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
then we had this economic impact

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
assessment which is the focus of my

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
presentation today

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,120
also i will talk a little bit about the

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
stakeholder survey

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,760
and there were also case studies which

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,640
were complementing these quantitative

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,600
analysis and also by the colleagues of

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
ofe

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,479
the analysis of policy initiatives and

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,040
that all was then used to derive

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
some recommendations uh particularly

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,600
addressing the european

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,560
union now

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
looking at the overall approach we have

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
been conducting

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,799
it's kind of a multi-method approach

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,119
and also based on different pillars

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
it means we looked on the one hand at

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
the cost that means what is the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,280
investment

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,159
both from the eu countries but also from

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
countries

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,520
located in eu towards towards open

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
source

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,000
to to get an idea uh what

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
we spend on on on the country but also

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,159
than on the aggregate

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
eu level but also at the company's level

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
um

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,640
on the other hand and that's a little

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,000
more tricky we also look at

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,040
the benefits it means here

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,960
at the macro level we developed a

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
macroeconomic growth model where we

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
integrated open source

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
and run the panel regressions covering

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,599
almost

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,160
20 years to assess the contribution of

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,480
open source to gdp and u

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
this has been complemented by the

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,239
results

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,280
of the stakeholder survey

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,120
but also from case studies which have

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
been conducted in the context of the

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,519
study

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
it means we have here then the

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,280
opportunity to to then compare

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
the cost with the benefit um results and

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
get then

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,720
some cost benefit ratios and we are then

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
able to validate not only

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
the assessment of the cost between the

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
macro and the micro level

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
and the benefits between the macro and

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,879
the micro level but also the cost per

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080
anniversary

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,720
that's the the logic of the the whole

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
approach

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
um in order to come to really validated

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,319
and sound results

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
now on the data um the data is still a

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,720
challenge

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,959
and um we relied on data um

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,640
kind of at github um on the depository

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,080
um because here at the tu delft they

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,280
they downloaded all the

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,920
information up to 2018 and that means we

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,720
have

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,360
1.3 billion comments uh 32 million users

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,680
which have also 1.5 million

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
organizational affiliations and country

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
codes

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
we had around even 700 000 organizations

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
at this time

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920
and this has been then combined with

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
other economic data to come up with then

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
some some assessment of both the cost

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
and the benefits

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,920
here this is the the rough developments

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,640
in the last 10 years up to 2018.

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
um there are new figures available which

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,879
show

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,400
that after some consolidations in 2018

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,000
2019 especially

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
uh also due to the takeover github by

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
microsoft

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,319
but now we see it's back on track um

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
and we see here germany the uk and

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,040
france is the top three countries

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,080
based on the number of comets we did

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
also

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
and this is another validation of our

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,400
approach we also looked at the

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
contributors which have

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
links to their country origins and here

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,639
again

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,199
um we see here germany

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,040
and the uk and france as the top country

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
and we see a little bit a stagnation in

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
2018 but i said

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,160
in 2020 it's up again we have to see

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
what will be the

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
situation after covet 19. um that's

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
that's interesting then then to see in

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
the future

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
now about that the cost based impact

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
assessment this is more or less the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,120
baseline

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,560
um and we had as i already mentioned we

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
have two pillars we looked at the effort

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
by member states

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
and also at the efforts by the most

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
active companies which

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
have their headquarters in eu member

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
states taking

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
not into account affiliates of microsoft

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
and other us players

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
and the basic assumption beyond this

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,039
this approach is that

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
the the benefits uh

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,520
should at least outweigh that the cost

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
uh invested into open source and i mean

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,039
this is really

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
then the the lower the lowest bound of

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,039
the economic

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,560
benefit of open source

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
now what do we see um as a reference we

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
have

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
um then this is not the perfect

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
reference but it's just an

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,080
important number is that in 2080 with

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
around 3 million employees in the

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,199
computer

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
programming sector in you and what we

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
find

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
is that we have around 260 000

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
contributors to to github

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,000
it means a little bit less than 10

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,360
percent of of all employees

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,360
and you have to know that uh not all

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
contributors have links to countries

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,319
therefore we will probably miss

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
another ten percent uh that's that's an

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,440
issue

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
now if you look at the average personal

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,400
cost here we also

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,400
um use the average cost in this sector

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,759
and then we come to a 14 billion

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,120
personal cost in 2018

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,199
if we look at the comets

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,520
of 30 million um in 2018 by eu member

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,560
uh countries or or contributors which

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,680
have a link to a eu member state

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,039
which includes also the uk we get uh

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,080
to an effort of around 16

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,400
000 full-time equipment and here

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
it would be an investment of 1 billion

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,280
personal cost

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,199
and this relationship also confirms

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,960
other studies which show that open

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,160
source developers

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,720
spend yeah around 10 percent

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
or maybe a little bit less on average on

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,520
open source during their week

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,599
and this this is therefore another kind

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,759
of indication that this makes sense

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
now looking at the the company's level

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
um

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,479
we have um the most active companies uh

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,120
identified and they

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
contribute more than 12 percent of all

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
commits of the eu

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
and they employ one more than one

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
million employees

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,520
and we find especially a very high share

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
of small companies

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,080
um that's that's very very important

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,720
to mention and

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,360
and what also uh very important is that

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,520
the smaller

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,960
the companies that the higher are the um

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,160
the higher are their investment

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,199
compared to the company sites it means

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
for example

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,520
those which have between 11 and 100

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,879
employees invest

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,360
more than five percent of their

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,919
full-time equivalents uh to open source

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,720
it means we have here also if we compare

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
that with the

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,039
the macro based cost assessment a nice

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,599
validation of our results

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,720
now coming to the benefits which is as i

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
already mentioned a little bit more

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
tricky here

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,199
um i'm not showing this uh

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
kind of equation which is the base for

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,919
our results

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,759
but we find a significant impact

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,400
of the pool of open source contributed

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,400
by

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,919
the eu member states to the eu gdp

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,680
and what we find concrete is that the

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,640
the 10 percent increase which we have

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,000
seen for example between 2017 and 18

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,399
contributed to github generated

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
point four percent of the gdp new and if

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,880
we take them the overall numbers

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,240
we get um to around 60 billion per year

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,360
um if we if you look at the comets um

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,800
the the so-called elasticity is even 0.6

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,000
and we get an even 95 billion per year

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,480
in 2018 that means overall

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,320
these are really highly significant

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
results and they are also

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,880
quite significant in numbers and

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
in the long run uh you could say that if

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
the contribution to open source

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,760
continues with the kind of 10 percent

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,800
increase per year

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,519
we could assume additional gdp of 100

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,680
billion per year if we include the

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,519
uk if we exclude that that's probably

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,519
around two-thirds of this number

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,399
now if we compare these costs and the

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,440
benefits

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,440
we get uh a ratio

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:45,040
of 1.4 one to four here we also consider

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,360
hardware cost um because uh

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,720
software developers also need hardware

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,279
and here we took

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,320
kind of a yeah the average investment

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
per employee

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
which might be also a little bit too

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
high on the other hand we have also

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,399
to take into account that the the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,519
benefits of open source

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,760
in 2018 for the gdp also

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
relies on open source developed in

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
previous years and here

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
we consider the last five years due to

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
some other

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
uh information we know about the the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
survival rate of

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,440
of code over time that was then our

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,200
assumption and therefore we get to this

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,279
figure one point one to four um

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
to complement our results we also looked

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,680
at the

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,480
views of the stakeholders um that means

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
here the idea was to to get a

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
complimentary

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,079
insight and overall this was really

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
widely distributed because

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,279
almost 1 000 responses uh

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
complete answers a little bit more than

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,880
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
due to some tricky questions which were

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,200
not so easy to

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
answer what are the main results the

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
incentives

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
to contribute are really finding

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,920
technical solution carrying forward the

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,320
state of the art of technology

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,600
but also very important is to avoid

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
vendor login

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
and and also knowledge seeking knowledge

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,120
creation

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,720
is very important from the benefit side

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,079
um the highest benefits

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,920
are related to the topic of really that

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
open source is supporting open standards

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,200
and interoperability

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
and since i'm doing kind of a lot of

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,560
standardization research

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,000
i'd like this nice comparable

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,720
insight and also improved access to code

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,399
and also the independence from propriety

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
software providers

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,160
the costs in general are less relevant

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
um here

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,279
error successfully is an issue and and

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
also

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
the cost for skilled labor contributing

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,320
to open source is an issue

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,440
and and the most and the

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,519
named cost benefit ratio is 1 to 10

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,839
which is not so far away from the other

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,560
cost benefit ratio we calculated

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,880
based on the macro level results it

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,000
means overall it's a very significant

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,000
investment by the eu

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
countries um and you allocated companies

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
to

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
into open source that means minimum

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,399
investment is 1 billion

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,040
per year in 2018 but probably it's

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,399
more than double or m triple uh because

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
we were quite single

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,760
conservative in our approach on the

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
other hand we see a significant

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,399
contribution of open source http in the

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,519
eu

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,440
it means a 10 increase per year

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:31,360
would generate additional 100 billion us

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,920
in the eu including the the uk per year

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,399
what we also looked as following frank

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,959
nagle's work in u.s

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,800
that open source is also contributing to

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,680
the foundation of startups a year

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
additional

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
1000 itc startups per year including the

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,399
uk

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,639
um have been calculated means another uh

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
important growth driver in the long run

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
um from the case studies

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,560
we we know especially that from the

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,399
public sector the the savings and total

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,040
cost of ownership is very important

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,320
but also the avoidance of vandal optic

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,959
further benefits

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
of open source are related to openness

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,639
especially years in the station and in

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
dropability is his name

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
independence and also labor cost savings

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,639
are important aspect

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,800
um based on this finding we derived some

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
some policy recommendations which i'd

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
show here in overview i cannot go into

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,519
that

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
because this would need another at least

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,440
50 minutes

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
to look at that but you see here a very

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
broad

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,040
set and portfolio of measures starting

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
with building institutional capacity

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
also in the public sector

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,279
because that's that's a requirement for

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
getting the

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,519
all the other instruments really running

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
and being effective

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,800
um knowledge creation and diffusion that

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
means also invest in r

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
d and human capital will be key that

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,639
will be a big challenge

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,880
but also kind of provide an adequate

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,639
regulatory environment

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
and finally also open source hardware

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
which has been an aspect of the study

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,519
has to be considered

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,800
and finally uh we have to think uh not

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,399
in the long but probably

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
in the short one also about

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,040
sustainability issues

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
related uh to to open source how how

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,440
sustainable solutions can be

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,240
pushed by using open source that means

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
in summary

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,279
we have a large economic impact also

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,800
maybe in the future for open source

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
hardware um

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,720
public policy is needed to to scale up

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,360
this to also to

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
to incentivize open source production in

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,279
in the long run because this is

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
benefiting the european economy

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,519
and therefore we need a comprehensive

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
and coordinated policy approach

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
which is based on really institutional

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,519
capacities at this

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,440
very layers of the public sector it

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,199
means not only at u level but also the

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,480
national and even the regional

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,600
or municipal level thank you very much

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
for your attention

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,959
and if you have questions you can send

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,040
me emails anytime
