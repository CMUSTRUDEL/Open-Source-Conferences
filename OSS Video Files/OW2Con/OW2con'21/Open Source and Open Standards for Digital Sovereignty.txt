Title: Open Source and Open Standards for Digital Sovereignty
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Open Source Software and Open Standards – especially document formats – are of key importance for the digital sovereignty strategies of individuals, companies, organisations and governments. Today, user-created content - and the ability to share it transparently - is in the hands of a few companies, which exploit the limited digital culture of users to their advantage. This situation can only be overcome by moving from proprietary to open source software and from proprietary to open standards.

[Music]

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
good morning

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,800
free open source software and open

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,920
standards for digital super entity

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
what does it mean digital sovereignty is

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
the ability of a country or a

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,160
group of countries like the european

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,119
union to provide the digital

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
technologies

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,000
critical for the welfare competitiveness

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,880
and ability to act

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,040
at the moment as we know uh part of

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
these technologies are in the ends

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,640
of a few companies

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:50,480
they're known by their initial as gafam

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,399
they are have been able

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,800
to create uh a situation

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,000
where they can do more or less whatever

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
they want

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,119
in terms of storing what we do

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,640
to sell us advertising they

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,680
most of the the services they sell are

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
free

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
and as many know when something is free

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,240
you

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
are the product the level of um

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,159
subservience to these companies is so i

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
that i will make an example which is

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,040
relevant only for microsoft

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
but uh human genes

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
have been renamed because excel was not

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,479
able

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,640
to correctly import the old names

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,159
so instead of having one single company

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,159
change or update or patch

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,720
one single software we the humanity have

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
changed

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,719
our human gene names this this is

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,280
just incredible and gives you um

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
an an idea of the power of these

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
companies uh

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,799
in comparison with governments with the

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
scientific community

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
with everyone

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,760
which is the state of digital

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
sovereignty

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
in europe the reality is that the state

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,160
is very bad

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:26,400
um companies uh the the

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,160
large u.s based companies are trying

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,280
to uh enter into whatever

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
software project should be managed only

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,160
in europe

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,319
uh we have seen uh what has

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
happened and it's happening to the gaia

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
x

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,480
x project and uh what is happening

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:54,319
in countries uh with the uh

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,319
the plan for recovery after covet

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:02,720
in in countries like italy the

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:06,800
coordinator of that plan for the digital

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,440
environment is a microsoft employee

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
that is unbelievable but it's the

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,400
reality

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,519
data during the years

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,560
have evolved so they

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
in the past they were just the result of

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
a process

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,680
then they became the enabler of process

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
then they were became the enabler of

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,200
products and now

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,000
they are the enabler of our economy

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,400
uh not everything but a lot of what we

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
do is based on data

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,920
and therefore the management of data the

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
handling of data the sharing of data is

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
uh

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
of key importance

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
what which is the difference between

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,480
proprietary and

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
free open source software proprietary

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,120
software protects the user by you

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
for scatting everything also the

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
information

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
but in this way they obfuscate the way

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,920
they handle

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,239
user data free open source software

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,720
on the contrary protects the user with

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,720
transparency so we say

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,759
what we do in term of co source code

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
we we are transparent in the way that we

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
handle data

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
the methodology is used by project to

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,479
manage

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,680
and use the data so what would change

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,880
moving from proprietary as of today to

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
uh free open source software especially

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
in the area of

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
desktop productivity which is the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
application used by

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,080
every person for his own needs

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,479
when you write a document you create a

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,280
spreadsheet to make your own calculation

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,000
you make a presentation you handle your

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,759
own personal data

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,880
so if this was meant could be managed

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
by free open source software european

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
government

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
would regain control of our data and

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
manage them

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
according to their confidentiality which

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,840
means

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,639
manage this data according to what

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
we the user and the owners of the data

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,360
would like them to

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,840
do of course in some cases it

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,800
it is wise to give up some

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,120
privacy because that is

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,380
an advantage for the user for instance

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,479
when

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,520
[Music]

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,800
my healthcare data

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,080
if they are available

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,840
if i have an accident uh the

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
doctors could be could look at my data

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,160
see if i have a

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,880
pathology uh if i need special care

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
and even if i'm not able to provide them

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,039
this data they could use these data to

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
my advantage

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
uh of course switching to free open

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,919
source software would

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,520
mean moving from proprietary to standard

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,400
document formats

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,960
and this would have a huge advantage in

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
term of

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,919
cost in terms of interoperability

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,960
because the lack of interoperability is

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,080
a cost

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759
in term of transparency and again in

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,280
term of the users being

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
able to decide which data they want to

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,960
be

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,919
share so accessible and data they they

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,520
don't want to be

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:35,840
shared so they are not accessible

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
apparently this is a no-brainer

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,440
it just makes sense but the problem is

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
that politicians are not technology

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,759
experts

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,400
they see the large companies as part of

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,400
the global system they

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,880
seem to ignore that these companies have

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,000
commercial strategy that

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,520
ignore completely the uh

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,560
the advantages of individuals and and of

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,759
countries and of the european union

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,319
and therefore the politician as they see

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,680
these companies as part of the system

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,599
uh consider issues that are relevant for

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,400
these companies a problem for

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,400
our transformation process digital

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
transformation process and they try to

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,639
help them

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,360
which is totally totally wrong it's a

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
it's exactly the contrary of what should

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
happen

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
the reality is that politicians exactly

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
because they do not understand

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,440
technology

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
they should see free open source

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,759
software

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,639
as part of the global system because

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,000
it's closer to the user it respect the

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
freedom of the users

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,080
it respect the freedom of the countries

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,400
it respect the freedom of the

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,680
governments it respect the freedom

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,479
of the entire system

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
they because they don't know free open

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,039
source software they

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
do not see free open source software as

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,759
a potential solution

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,879
and as a consequent of this they put

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,440
everything in the ends of u.s companies

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
large u.s companies there is a

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,560
free software foundation europe project

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,720
that is called public money public code

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,240
and basically it says that if the money

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,400
is paid by the community

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,599
then the code should be public the code

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,200
should be owned by the community

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,880
so how can we regain the control of our

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,719
data

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,839
it would be rather easy if the

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,320
uh the entire

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
organization the global organization

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
political

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,800
economical could choose

00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,080
based on the advantages for the users

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,040
and the only way is to to regain control

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,600
of our data is to have a format

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,959
and a technology that allows true

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,279
interoperability of contents

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:16,240
documents are an extremely important

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,800
tool because they move around from

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
citizen to government to government

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
from government to government and from

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,600
government to cities

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
and they they move from enterprise to

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,480
enterprise

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,800
they move around documents carry

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,080
our our common intelligence

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,240
they carry what we create they carry

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,399
information they are a source of power

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,959
if uh because knowledge is power

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:54,160
uh if correctly managed

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,920
so the problem the the produce

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,080
update or reproduced documents is

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,720
extremely important

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
and if the platform that is used to

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
produce update and reproduce the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,880
document

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,079
is not open is proprietary then the user

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,600
will be locked

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,120
in into that platform and will not

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,399
be able to manage their own contents

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
so they will create documents but they

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,560
will not

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,440
be able to manage them with the same

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,680
level of freedom they have created that

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,800
document

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
so government should be platform

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
independent

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
and allow only true document standards

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,720
because the

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,279
pseudo standards that are used today

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,880
in a way that is not visible to anyone

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,920
prevent the users to

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,040
prevent interoperability prevent users

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,240
to be the controller

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,519
of their documents and the tweak

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,560
standards

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,640
force citizens to pay a fee to create

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,079
document because they have to

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,440
pay for a proprietary license

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:13,040
or in some cases they have to accept the

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
the license that basically

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
shares the ownership of the uh the

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
documents of the contents

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,519
between the real you the real owner

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,760
the user and the owner of the platform

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
so only standards associated to free

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,240
open source software

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,680
can solve the problem

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,959
we have one really very good

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,440
standard for documents is odf

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,680
odf is the best under file format for

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
user of personal productivity because

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
it's consistent

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,639
is interoperable is predictable is

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,839
is easy to understand even for

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,639
non-technical users

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
the the unfortunate reality is that the

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,040
majority

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,880
but when i say the majority i'm

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,320
it's over 95 of the user

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,920
probably over 99 of the user

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,040
they think that the microsoft office

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,800
documents they use are standards

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,120
because of the way the standards has

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,000
been created and managed

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,000
in a non-transparent way so they that

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,839
there is a standard

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,399
uh which has the same name and the same

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
extent file extension but the fact is

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
that

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,639
no one is using that standard and all

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,399
the other using the non-standard variant

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,680
of the format so we can say that 100

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
of existing microsoft office files

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,880
around

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
are non-standard they are proprietary

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,079
and

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:57,760
they just respect the

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,959
the the strategy where office of an xml

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
has been designed

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
it has been designed as a pseudo

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,519
standard to

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,760
propagate yesterday document

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,839
issues and lock-in strategy for the next

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,360
20 to 50 years

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,639
the reality is that odf was created

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,160
to to liberate the users

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,279
from the lock-in to provide users a

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
transparent format which is good for the

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,680
next

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,040
20 to 50 years and the users continue

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,079
to use a format that is uh

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,839
exactly the opposite it's blocking

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
their capability of choosing for the

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,880
next 20 to 50 years

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,399
uh we have a a simple

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,680
and true standards odf

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,399
odts that the the text variant

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
with non-existing lower non-existing

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,959
complexity

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,880
and human readable files and on the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
other end you have a microsoft office

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,320
format

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,639
which is uh putting injecting the

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
highest possible complexity

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
inside the files exactly because they

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,760
don't want the

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,040
xml files to be human readable

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,959
because they want to lock in the users

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,839
so please help us

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:29,199
in making it clear especially for the

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,120
uh for the uh is

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,880
for the european union for the

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,079
governments

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,160
help us in making it clear

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,519
that uh switching to open standards

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,880
is the way to go and is

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,079
the way everyone should be looking

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,639
at document formats

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,079
for the next 20 to 50 years we have the

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,800
technology

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:01,600
is easy to implement don't be shy

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
use the technology liberate your

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,240
documents

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,240
