Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	In January 2021, the W3C, supported by leading technology companies, launched the MiniApp Working Group to define standards for a new paradigm of light hybrid applications called MiniApps. The OW2 Quick App initiative will promote a concrete implementation of this abstract MiniApp standard, enabling light applications in native environments for smart devices. As the MiniApp standard matures, the implementation of Quick App runtime engines for different devices will facilitate a powerful "code once, deploy anywhere" paradigm.
