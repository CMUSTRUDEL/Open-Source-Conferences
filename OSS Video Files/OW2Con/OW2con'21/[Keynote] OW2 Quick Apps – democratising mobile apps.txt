Title: [Keynote] OW2 Quick Apps â€“ democratising mobile apps
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	In January 2021, the W3C, supported by leading technology companies, launched the MiniApp Working Group to define standards for a new paradigm of light hybrid applications called MiniApps. The OW2 Quick App initiative will promote a concrete implementation of this abstract MiniApp standard, enabling light applications in native environments for smart devices. As the MiniApp standard matures, the implementation of Quick App runtime engines for different devices will facilitate a powerful "code once, deploy anywhere" paradigm.

back into the history with the rapid

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
development of

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,320
internet service we have been through

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
the pc

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
era focused on the traditional white

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,200
pages

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,399
and the information search and

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
the early mobile internet era focused on

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
the

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,199
application market now we are entering a

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,640
fully connected

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,760
new year in the new year

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
various industries are embracing new

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
business

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
opportunities brought by the trends of

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,080
the digital transformation

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,200
and launching the innovative

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,759
promotion

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,880
activities game company can launch

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
a variety of games that can be started

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
anytime

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,079
anywhere on the extra however

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,600
this application also in

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,200
bottlenecks according to the statistics

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,479
each mobile phone user store

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,000
only 50 common mobile application

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
on average in the future if hundreds of

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
service

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
requires user to install application in

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480
advance

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,840
it will be inconvenient for the users

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,200
based on the background the miniature

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,800
model can play in

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,520
important role min app is a

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
new web-based mobile application that

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,760
features

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,440
no installation instant use and

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,360
directed service for example by scanning

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,120
a qr code

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,360
you can start a game shopping boarding

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
on a hotel reservation without

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,239
installation

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,599
in application this safe mobile

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,160
storage and installation time this will

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,519
improve the user experience

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
in january 2021 the w3c

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
established the miniature standard

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
working group

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,959
huawei alibaba i do google microsoft

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
and some other companies are currently

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,920
promoting

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,360
unified standards that encompass

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,959
different service device

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,519
and from multi-vendors using

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
different operating system developer

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,360
will

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,640
only need to develop once under the

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,680
app can be released on the

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,480
multi terminal and operating system

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
this can greatly reduce their developer

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
cost

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,840
for example a quick game application

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,519
for android can be easily

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,720
run on a pc with window and this can

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,560
reduce repeating development

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,239
working load the game can be

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,599
played on the mobile phone on the switch

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,799
to a pc at any time bring the new

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,120
close-in experience to the users

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,560
in china minab is starting to take ship

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,959
according to the statistics about 10

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,239
of the internet traffic in 2020

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,840
came from the minneapolis however

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,360
in europe native applications are still

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,400
mainly used meanwhile as

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,040
in its early stage when the

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
perception of the meaning of by various

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
industry

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,000
and developers is relatively low

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,759
therefore we propose to set up in

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,199
industry instruments interest group

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,960
to in the europe developer community

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,160
ow 2 which used the quick hub

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
as an example of the meaning of standard

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,759
to mode

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,120
to promote the industry

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,840
reach the industry consensus attract

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
more and more a developer to join and

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,759
create

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,960
more and more innovative applications

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,080
that serves various industries

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,120
together we will extend

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,479
this emerging industry and promote the

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
development

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,479
of the internet service in this new year

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
now i will give the floor to my

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
colleague

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,840
martin he will explain more details

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:38,880
about the quick cup and this new

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,000
initiative thank you you mr one for this

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
introduction

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
so quick apps is a new concept of hybrid

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
applications

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
that do not need installation and can be

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,039
easily discovered in

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
search results message links smart

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,240
assistants and many other means on the

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
web and your device

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
with just one just one click or a snap

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
in the qr code we can trigger the app

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,840
functionality in milliseconds

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,639
so this is a perfect mechanism to access

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
services quickly when we are on the move

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
the quick app platform is a framework

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
for mobile application development

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
it's based on the front-end web

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,280
technology stack and it's

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
strongly linked to the operating system

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
this means that quick app

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,199
offers an enhanced native user

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,360
experience with maximized performance

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,880
with 20 less code than an android

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
application

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
the quick app platform is based on

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,080
development trends with a model view

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
view model architecture

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
it also follows the w3c mini app

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,039
standard which is based on

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,600
html like templates javascript and css

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
and the wcc media working group is

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
welcoming new participants and

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,039
implementations

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
to make mini apps a global success

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,160
currently quick apps which is an

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,560
implementation of mini apps

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
are supported by over 1.2 billion

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,599
devices worldwide most of them are based

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
on android

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,520
but this open platform could be

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,880
implemented on any operating system and

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,800
device

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,919
developers may use advanced user

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
interface components

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,759
like star rating tabs or maps and

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
advanced device services

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,960
like push notifications access to the

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
calendar or running the app in the

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
background

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
to deliver excellent user experiences

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
with minimal effort

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,080
also quick apps can be integrated as

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
widgets as you can see in this picture

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,319
quick apps also offers total flexibility

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,599
to developers and publishers in the

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
distribution phase

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
so you can call pack and deliver the app

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,000
using

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
any mechanism you want thus

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
quick apps are the perfect complement

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,160
for native applications

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
enabling new business opportunities

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,120
innovation

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
and enhancing user experience to deliver

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
better services and engage

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
new customers quick apps offer endless

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
options for products and service

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
discoverability

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,080
just with one click of that the user

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,199
will start the

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
interruption this will avoid any initial

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,440
friction between the customer and the

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
services

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,960
this will also increase user acquisition

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
most quick apps are free of charge but

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
they can be monetized

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,639
through in-app purchases and advertising

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
as in native apps

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
advanced customization and seamless user

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
interaction let marketers provide

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
customers with tailor-made content and

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,639
experiences

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
so we hope we can see quick apps in any

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,400
operating system

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,440
and any device as a universal platform

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
my colleague christian

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,599
is going to explain the first steps to

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
achieve it

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
hi it's great to be here with you today

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
now we've heard from mr wang and martin

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
about the amazing

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
potential that quick apps have to

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
ushering this new era of

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
low friction user interactivity for many

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,320
different types of device

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
in many domains and for many use cases

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
from on the go click and play gaming on

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
a smartphone

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,680
or interactive house appliances or

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
visitor guides for museums and travel

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
passes or

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
even accessing your local city services

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,880
such as

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
your local housing office or simply

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
paying for a parking meter or if you're

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
unlucky

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
a parking ticket for this to happen of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
course

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,120
for this nascent ecosystem to grow there

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
are four foundations

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,279
that really must be positioned we need

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
to raise awareness

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
around the possibilities and the

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
benefits and the limits of these

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
applications

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
you the developer community need to have

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
easy access to rich technical

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
information and great support network

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
and

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
appropriate tooling devices need to

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,920
support this new framework

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
as we saw quick apps don't run in the

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,920
browser they run close to the os

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
that means less baggage better

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
performance but it also means we need

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,120
those device manufacturers on board

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
and we need to ensure that quick apps

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
respect best practices

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
such as for good security and data

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
privacy

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,399
now through the quick app initiative

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
hosted by ow2 we will work together to

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
help position and build upon these

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,440
foundations

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
on the application side promotional

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
efforts will raise awareness and spread

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
understanding in the developer and

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,200
business communities

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
great technical documentation is will be

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
authored

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
for tutorials and faqs and programming

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
guides not just for apis but also how to

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,560
make your quick apps

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,519
sustainable or accessible

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,880
open tools code templates runtime

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,920
engines

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,360
migration tools all of these

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,320
need to be developed now on the hardware

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,200
side of course

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
we have the w3c developing the mini app

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
standard

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,279
and we hope that the quick app

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
initiative and his participants can feed

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
in

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
and help grow that mini app standard but

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
equally we hope that the quick app

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
initiative

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,800
will be a dissemination channel for the

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,279
standard

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,040
and this will help create that global

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,399
industrial consensus that we talked

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
about

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,760
now if we do this together and we do it

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,120
right if we build these enablers

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,760
for open ecosystem success everybody

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,880
benefits

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,800
now the effort the initiative will be

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,720
governed through the ideals of floss

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,040
will be inclusive and respectful

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
meritocratic and transparent

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
open to anyone and definitely not pay to

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
play

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,040
as an example the steering committee

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,320
will have representation from

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,360
each organization and each task force

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
and it will deliver its value

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
to the whole ecosystem through the task

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
forces

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,160
in fact any participant can propose and

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
then lead the task force

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,519
the only real consideration is that the

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
participant must be

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,440
motivated intrigued or should i say

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,079
interested in helping to mature and

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
develop this new dynamic

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,200
and this will bring benefits to

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,279
everybody of course

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
now rome wasn't built in a day as the

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,040
saying goes

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
and this quick app initiative with ow 2

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
won't be built

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
by any single company and definitely not

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
in a day

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
it's going to take time and effort we

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,320
know that and above all it's going to

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
take many different parties from

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160
different domains and different

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,040
companies and different cultures

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,000
collaborating together this is not a

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,000
single vendor

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
initiative this is a collaborative

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,720
initiative

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,160
open by design talking of which

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,920
let's see some of the wonderful and

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
amazing launch participants

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,600
hi this is pablo poca from ctic we are

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
the w3c chapter hub

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
for spain and spanish speaking in latin

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,839
countries our activities focus on the

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,839
development of innovation projects for

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,560
clients using artificial intelligence

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
and data related technologies therefore

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
visualization tools and interfaces are

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
crucial for us

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,839
in our projects we face testing and

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
validation activities where the

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
quick deployment of developments is a

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
decisive factor

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
this is usually very intensive in time

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
due to the need of developing different

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,959
native apps

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,279
and at this point this quick app

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,560
initiative will help us to overcome

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,399
these limitations

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,639
while it will pave the way for the

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,800
progressive web applications

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,040
do you like the process of installing

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
apps consumer experience has changed

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
tremendously

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,800
let's bring new standards to the market

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,360
let's facilitate content production for

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
quick apps

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,240
our vision is to build the ecosystem

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
that brings captivating games to

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
billions of players instantly

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,639
so far across the web and mobile more

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
than 1.2 billion players have played our

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
games

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
powered by the frvi distribution

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
platform

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,000
we joined as an early partner for huawei

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
quick apps and have

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
already validated that platform can

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
support advertisement

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
and in-app purchase business models on

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
par

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
legacy distribution channels while fibr

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
success

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
has been enabled by our proprietary

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
technology

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,040
we believe strongly in the future where

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
all developers get to choose how

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,199
users consume their content through easy

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
integration and distribution with many

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,720
platforms

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
so today we are excited to announce that

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,040
we are joining the quick app initiative

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
to help build a standardized and open

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,639
way for all developers

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
to get their great games in front of

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,000
billions of players
