00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
we've mentioned the adobe 2

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
good governance initiative a couple of

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
times today

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
so this is the presentation about the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,560
audible 2 open source

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,560
good governance initiative at w2 an

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,240
initiative is the joint effort between

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,519
members and non-members

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,000
to address market need the need here

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,800
is that for guidance as to how to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
properly

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,030
manage open source software so we're

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
going to

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,800
[Music]

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,079
look at why we are doing this initiative

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,559
then what we are actually doing and then

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
where we actually going with what we

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,680
have

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,840
there's no doubt that open source

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,879
software is growing

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,039
and becoming mainstream um

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,239
we even have the figures to demonstrate

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,280
it the one to

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,079
your left here is from a recent study by

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
red hat

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
that explains that within next two years

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,159
two-thirds

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
of an enterprise software stack will be

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240
made of pro

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
of uh open source software uh the one to

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,920
the right

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,159
is from a well-known study by sonotype

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,880
so one on result by sender type

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
that says that for any new application

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,240
80 to 90 percent of the code

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
comes from existing components many of

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,680
which of course

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
are open source but there is another

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
evolution

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,159
that uh we are interested in uh for the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,280
rw2 initiative here

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,320
is that all the open source is

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,399
growing from an initial market

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,680
of open source aware users

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,600
towards a growing market of

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,680
skeptical users or maybe more precisely

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,719
users that have been educated with pro

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,960
proprietary software and that may feel

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:06,000
uncomfortable with adopting open source

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
and that's understandable because open

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,039
source

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
is maybe one reality but it has

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,160
different perspectives

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,160
financial commercial technical

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
uh there is or even this community

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,520
dimension that

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,400
may feel a little bit new etc

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
the need we are addressing for a

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
consistent

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,360
integrated approach that can bring

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,319
results to organizations in terms of

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
economies

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,879
budget economies digital sovereignty

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,599
technical responsiveness etc but also an

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
approach

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,840
that is compatible with the management

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
structure

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
of these organizations that is an

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
approach that can be adapted to the

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
specifics of its organization

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,160
an approach that can be shared so that

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
organization can understand

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,959
whether compare than each other

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,840
an approach that also can be managed

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
meaning with actions and activities that

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
can be

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,599
uh identi properly identified and

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,080
a methodology that can be measured

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,440
meaning of which we can measure the

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
progress

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,519
so that's the need we're addressing and

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
we have developed we are still

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,680
developing

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,799
i must say a methodology

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,280
that is based on pursuing

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:36,879
five goals the usage goal

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,720
chess goal culture goal engagement goal

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,799
and strategy goal

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,239
these goals should be obtained

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,280
through activities and these activities

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,200
are described with scorecards what we

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
call scorecards

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,239
so that's the simple blueprint you need

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
to have in mind for this

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,319
comprehensive approach scorecards

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,040
that describe activities that helps to

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
obtain the goals

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,040
goal by goal what do we have we have

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
the usage goal the first one which is

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,200
about

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
being efficient in using open source

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,239
software

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
so it's all about having the technical

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,479
skills

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,400
and properly managing the

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,600
portfolio of open source software that

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
we have

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
so we are identifying activities to

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
pursue that goal

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,400
and some verification points such as

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,880
having an inventory of

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
the open source used or an inventory of

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,199
the required

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
skills that we may be needing

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
at this stage i must say that the

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,240
activities that we are

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,400
suggesting here are generic they

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
are to be customized by each

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
organization so that they can

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,320
actually literally uh

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,040
own these activities and apply to the

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
activities

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,080
kpis etc that really match their way

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,800
of functioning so that was the usage

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,280
goal

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
the next goal is the trust goal it's

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
about

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,240
using open source software in an

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,680
environment or in a way that is safe

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,560
and dependable so it's

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,960
about properly managing dependencies

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
properly managing vulnerabilities making

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,639
sure

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,000
that we don't uh import vulnerabilities

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,360
with reusing components um it's about

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
managing legal compliance uh both from

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
the standpoint

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
of the components that we import or the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
license

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
that we attribute to code that we may

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,520
publish as open source software etc

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,160
so the um the verification points here

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,160
uh are such like using the proper tools

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
to manage dependencies for instance

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,759
or using or having appointed a person to

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
manage legal complaints

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
the next goal is what we call the

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
culture goal

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
we know that open source software is not

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
just about technology

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,479
or legal compliance but it's about

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
working together so it's about people

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,639
and culture

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,400
so this goal is about making sure that

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,319
the development team

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,560
feel um that they belong

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
to the open source community at large

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039
that they are

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,600
empowered to uh reach out to

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
other projects uh to communicate in

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
mailing lists

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,600
to attend events etc so we identified

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,759
certain activities here

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
and verification points to make sure

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,520
that the development team

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,440
feel comfortable in using computers

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
so that's let's say this is the

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
individual perspective

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
and now there is the corporate

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,520
perspective with the engagement

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,560
goal and the idea is to make sure that

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,919
the organization

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,280
engages with the open source ecosystem

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
um

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,960
understands that the sustainability of

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,080
this ecosystem

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,160
is its own interest really so we have

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,919
identified some activities such as

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
making sure we contribute back to open

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,240
source project or we contract

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
with open source software vendors and we

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,639
pay for their

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,039
support plans for instance or

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,319
participating in open source events

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,280
and with the related verification points

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
and the last goal is the strategy goal

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,160
uh

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
it's about proactively using open source

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
software for

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
innovation and competitiveness

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,560
understanding that

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,000
open source is a vehicle for um

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
digital transformation and making sure

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
that

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
open source is visible at the highest

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,599
level

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,720
of the of the hierarchy of an

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
organization

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
so we have some verification points uh

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,319
and even as to making sure that open

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
source is mentioned

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
in the annual report for instance

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,599
so we have redefined the activities

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
again as i said

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,879
these activities are generic but

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,680
we have managed a

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,840
workable useful structure with a

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
description of the activities

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
then the activity or the opportunity

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
assessment so

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,599
the motivation for the activity why this

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
activity is relevant that's the next

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,520
structure

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,919
a section here then we have

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
an activity a section about how we

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,240
measure progress

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,200
and how what sort of kpis we want for

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,120
for each of the activities then the next

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,839
section is about the tools that

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
are recommended to make sure that we

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,800
implement properly the activities

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,480
properly and uh efficiently the activity

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
then there is another section which is

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
useful about recommendations

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,160
so this is where we try to collect uh

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
feedbacks

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,240
and lessons learned by other users

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
we can develop this methodology by using

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
different tools

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,839
we're actually developing a web app to

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,800
facilitate the deployment of the

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
methodology but

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,680
at the moment we are using a bug tracker

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
uh with an issue temp

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
an issue template to define each

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
activity we use this

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
environment to manage the users the

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
owners of the activities or the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
participants in the activities

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
and to track the progress of the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
activities so that's the sort of thing

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,839
we need to

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,720
to implement so in the end the idea

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
is you have your game plan for

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,240
implementing

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
good open source governance and this

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
game plan

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,600
will uh or the the methodology or the

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,480
dashboard we have a dashboard that can

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,399
help you manage the progress so you can

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
define your priorities

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
you can define some milestones you can

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
identify

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
the activities that are in progress

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
those that

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
are on hold not started yet etc and you

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
can

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,120
use this approach to report to the top

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,839
management

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
so now how do we where do we go with

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
this

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
so uh we understand that we're not on

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,279
our own

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,000
in this in this space there is uh there

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,600
are

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,360
great resources from the linux

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,839
foundation especially from the to do

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
group

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
but also from open chain and for

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,640
instance in france we have

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,160
the tosit group which is a group of

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,680
large end users sharing

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,200
best practices but we feel that

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,560
we have a already now a proper value

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
proposal

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
in in terms of this blueprint to help

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
implement

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
corporate wide open source policies and

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,880
those five goals

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,079
usage trust culture

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,279
engagement and strategy so we want to

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
promote this and we promoting this

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
through

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,160
three strategic objectives the first one

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,360
is that we want to use this to help

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
define what is the state of the art what

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
it means

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,279
to be using open source software

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
professionally and in a way that is

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,720
appropriate

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,560
so we want to help define the state of

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,079
the art in this domain

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,839
the next objective is uh to work

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,360
is that we want to work for all the

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
sectors of activities

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,839
not just the software vendors or systems

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
integrators

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
all those platform companies that live

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and grow by developing

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
software but we want to look at the

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
other sectors

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,399
transportation companies retail um

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,160
companies manufacturing companies

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,200
local or central administrations uh

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,200
healthcare organizations etc

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
so this is these are the the people who

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
want to work for

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,639
and we understand that it would be more

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,079
productive to develop this from a

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,480
european perspective

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,160
of course the lessons will be global but

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
i think the driving force will be

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,560
european

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:07,839
in our efforts and the third

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,360
objective is to actually

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,399
develop and keep running and maintain

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,160
a platform that is as open and

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,360
accessible as possible

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,040
for people to learn from others

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,680
and for people to share their experience

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,720
we understand that uh autoblue2 cannot

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,760
develop that

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
all by itself so we are doing this at

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
the european level

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,000
and we've approached open source

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,880
non-profit organizations based in europe

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,959
starting with the eclipse foundation um

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
we've also approached the free software

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,320
foundation europe or the foundation for

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,760
public code

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,839
and we are working together to

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,600
promote this this methodology this

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
resource we've also presented it to

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,279
large

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
users to large end users and some of

00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,760
them have already committed to beta test

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,320
it

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
and then to provide us some feedback

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
which should take us towards the end of

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
the year

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
with a mature methodology so that's our

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,240
timeline for 2021

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
uh we are now in the end at the end of

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
the

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,519
second quarter we are recruiting our

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,519
beta testers

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,720
we have a framework a blueprint

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,839
we will work from between now and the

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,680
end of the year

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,279
to mature this this methodology

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
and then towards the end we can even

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,639
onboard vendors we think that

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,360
there is room for consultant to uh

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
provide support to end users uh to

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,680
implement this

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,519
methodology so how you can

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
it's it's an open effort how you can get

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,000
in on it so at the moment the entry

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
point

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
is open source underscore governance

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
which is the page

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,560
of the initiative on the adobe website

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,079
where that takes you to what we call the

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,760
resource center

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,760
from which you can create your user

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,600
account but we are developing

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,560
another uh website with this uh um

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
nonprofit organizations from europe so

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,720
stay tuned for

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
more about the uh the lw2 good

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,839
governance initiative
