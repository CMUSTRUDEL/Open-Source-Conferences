	00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,399
good morning

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,559
and welcome to autoruticon21

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
i hope this conference finds you all

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
safe and well

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
we all wish the pandemic would go away

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,520
but as long as it's here

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,000
this conference has to take place online

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,840
we have to keep the conversation going

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
we have to keep the conversation going

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
because

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,359
open source is not just about coding and

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,680
technology

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
it's about people it's about people

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,559
sharing

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,800
software and values audaboo2 as well

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,760
is a community it's a community of some

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,960
2500 people

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,320
46 of them from europe 20

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,200
of them from north america 17 from asia

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,120
and 17 from the rest of the world it's a

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,320
community of individuals

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960
and also of legal entities we have some

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,120
30 legal entities and

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,800
two-thirds of them are smes most of them

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,479
from from europe so that's our community

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,080
so we need to keep this conversation

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,720
going within our community

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,640
and also with the rest of the world but

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,760
what kind of conversation are we talking

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
about

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,320
and here i'd like to comment on the

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
theme of the conference

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
leveraging the european open source

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
ecosystem

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
you may all be familiar by now with my

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
analysis of the four moments of the free

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,479
live and open source

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,840
software movement with the first moment

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,159
in the in the 80s driven by developers

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
and

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,040
for developers and driven by ethical

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
values

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
then there is a second moment towards

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
the middle of uh

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,360
second half of the 90s by entrepreneurs

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,920
leveraging the open source business

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
model

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,159
to grab market share then with cad

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
computing emerging

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
around 2010 we have another moment with

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
consortiums

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,240
and companies working together and using

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
opensource software

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
as a vehicle for collaborative

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,759
innovation

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,440
and then more recently we had what i

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,720
call the industry moment

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,760
with conventional board of directors

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,640
representing pension funds um

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,000
authorizing uh management teams to spend

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
billions of dollars

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,560
or euros investing in open source

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
companies so

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
what if this analysis is right is

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
correct

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,319
what it shows is probably a growing

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
contradiction between individual

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,120
developers

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
driven by their own values and motivated

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
by the fact that

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
open source gives them control over

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
their work and

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
over the destiny of their work in the

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,560
sort of

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,280
an artistic situation

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,519
that's on one end on the other on the

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,360
other hand we have

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,400
capitalistic situations corporations

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,800
that are pursuing interest that

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
may be very different from those of the

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
developers

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,080
and all this is still open source and in

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,640
the middle we have

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,280
different flavors all different type of

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,319
situations

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,319
we think there is a way to

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
manage this uh this growing

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,360
contradiction

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,239
and we think that open source

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,159
organizations have a role to play

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:36,319
not just by advocating or lobbying

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,599
or posting papers but also by

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,200
doing something at w2

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,599
we are proud to be part of the product

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
production chain the value chain of the

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,560
open source software

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
you find on the other retro website

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
software

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,640
real software that solves real life

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,319
business problems it's not just our

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
members and our project

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,400
that are part of this value chain we as

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,159
an independent organization we are also

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,959
creating resources to try

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,560
and support this ecosystem the first

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,320
resource we are developing

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
and we've been working on it for the

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,600
last two three years

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,560
is what we call market readiness levels

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,720
it's a composite index that positions

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,320
the uh the bluetooth project

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,360
according to an acceptability rating

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,400
by conventional decision makers we are

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
addressing

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,919
the need the culture the expectations

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
of the convention the average decision

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
maker

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
the one that is not an open source

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,040
activist the one has that has been

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,160
educated by proprietary vendors

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,919
so we try to address them in a way

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,360
that is familiar to them all our project

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,759
or a mature project

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
now have been rated by this market

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
readiness level index

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
and that's something that is pretty

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
unique to w2

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
the next resource we have been

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
developing over the last couple years is

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
what we call the

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
rw2 open source good governance

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,400
initiative

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
we think there is more to managing open

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,479
source software

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
than just managing legal compliance

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,360
there are many different perspectives to

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,039
open to software

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,280
legal of course but technical community

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:33,680
financial etc and we think that

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,720
today it's time to have a comprehensive

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,320
framework

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,880
that enables cios to professionally

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
manage open source software it's the

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
only way

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,199
open source will reach out to all areas

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,240
in the market

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,759
so with these two resources with the our

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
code base

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,840
with our way to address

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
different types of decision makers

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,319
different types of

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,319
partners that's the scope of the

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,560
conference this year

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
that's what we call addressing or

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
leveraging

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,720
the european open source ecosystem

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,639
because of course

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,160
we do that from a european perspective

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,840
and this thing is organized this year

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
in six major sessions

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,199
of course we have a technical session

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
showcasing the other brilliant project

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
and we also have three technical

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,080
sessions

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,800
one on technologies for the developers

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
one addressing cloud computing and open

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,560
source software

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,800
and the third one by inviting

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
third-party technologies or inviting

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,479
third-party projects

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,919
and we have two non-technical sessions

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,440
one on governance and one on

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,440
ecosystem and business models

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,960
these sessions are populated by all the

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,120
talks that you can find

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,479
on the program by 45 speakers

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
representing 15 countries so this is a

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,400
truly

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
international conference

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,479
now those that were here last year

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,520
will recognize our platform

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,880
it's based on rocket chat as the central

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,160
interface we have used

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,759
obs a kdnlive to

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,120
for the video editing the program

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,160
has been managed through pre-talks

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,560
all the conference web web pages have

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,680
been developed with xwiki

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,000
and the video streaming and archiving

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,160
is done with uh youtube and bigtube

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,440
and you see one innovation here this

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
year we have gtc

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,319
integrated into our platform and gc

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,599
will enable us to run two sessions two

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
interactive sessions we're not taking

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,319
much risk here

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,319
a roundtable and the award ceremony

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
so because uh all the presentations have

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
been

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,440
recorded uh for the set of quality and

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
timing

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
you can be sure that all the talks will

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
start

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
at the exact time specified in the

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
program

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
so again i refer you to the program

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
webpage

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,840
on the conference website

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,680
if you look at the interface you're

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,919
really there of course

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,760
what you see you see to the on the left

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,880
pane a series of

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
chat rooms so at the top you will have

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
all presentation chat rooms each

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,080
presentation

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,200
will be accompanied by a dedicated room

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
you will be able to use that chat to ask

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,920
questions

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,860
[Applause]

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,760
good morning and a warm welcome to the

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,920
10th edition of adobe 2 conference

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
this year again i'm not able to see your

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,279
face but

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
i can easily imagine an assembly of

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
people of different countries

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
different cultures the different

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
companies you've joined this event as a

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
developer

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,079
as a cio as a strategist as a scientist

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
for the sake of curiosity maybe i'd like

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
to ask you a question

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
what do you have in common let's take an

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
example

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
what do factor effects and microsoft

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,240
companies have in common

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
a hint they've recently joined the adw2

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,160
community

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,399
but why the response is simple

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
and i suppose you already know they

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,440
embrace the free and open source

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,760
software rules

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
would you call me naive of course the

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
business model of rw2's members are

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
different

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,680
their size are different more than that

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
microsoft and open source was not a love

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
story for years

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
on the other hand for many of our

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
members free and open source software

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
is the main spring of the activity that

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
being said

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
back to the question what do we have in

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
common

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,120
a contract a legal contract between

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
software providers and

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
users an enforceable contract that give

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
users

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
the freedom to run a program for any

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,160
purpose

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,040
the freedom to study how the program

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,399
works the freedom to redistribute copies

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
of the program

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
the freedom to distribute copies of your

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
modified versions

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,480
with the time being these contracts

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
appear to be a catalyst for positive

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
side effects

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
greater innovation more resilient

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,959
industry

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
a more rewarding way of working for

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,040
developers

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,600
at the end a more vibrant ecosystem with

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
limited vendor looking

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
we are all here for one of several

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
reasons above mention

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,920
we are a global organization but it

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
appears these positive effects are the

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,440
ones claimed by european citizens

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,240
this year's topic is leveraging the

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
european

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,000
open source ecosystem during this

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
conference

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,040
you will discover how much this

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
ecosystem is already vibrant how a w-2

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
has

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
built year after year a community

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
dedicated to foster a mature open source

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
software industry

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
as usual i could not open this

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
conference without paying a tribute to

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,959
the management office

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,880
the team that operates rw2 day after day

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,399
behind the scene and even without a

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
proper scene

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
you are the fuel they are the engine

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,519
sorry for the metaphor

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,000
you are the code they are the compiler

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
speaking of whom i will now let cedric

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
thomas our ceo

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,600
introduce the rich program for this next

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
two days of rw2 conference

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,800
