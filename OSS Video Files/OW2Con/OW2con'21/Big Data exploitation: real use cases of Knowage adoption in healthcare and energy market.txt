Description: 
	This speech will present two Knowage use cases about Big Data exploitation in the healthcare and the energy market. The first use case illustrates how Knowage adoption helped public health authorities to create a homogeneous system of information and knowledge transfer across all the organization, allowing advanced and multi-dimensional analysis and the evaluation of company performances. The second use case concerns the energy market and energy consumption in buildings: the solution developed with Knowage provides real-time and periodic power consumption feedbacks, enabling data-driven decisions to save resources and money. Both cases have been managed end-to-end, from data collection to the final use: attend this speech to discover all the steps and the innovative features that brought these projects to success.
