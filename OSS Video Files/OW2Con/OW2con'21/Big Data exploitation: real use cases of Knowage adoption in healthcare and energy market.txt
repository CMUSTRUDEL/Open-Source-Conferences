Title: Big Data exploitation: real use cases of Knowage adoption in healthcare and energy market
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	This speech will present two Knowage use cases about Big Data exploitation in the healthcare and the energy market. The first use case illustrates how Knowage adoption helped public health authorities to create a homogeneous system of information and knowledge transfer across all the organization, allowing advanced and multi-dimensional analysis and the evaluation of company performances. The second use case concerns the energy market and energy consumption in buildings: the solution developed with Knowage provides real-time and periodic power consumption feedbacks, enabling data-driven decisions to save resources and money. Both cases have been managed end-to-end, from data collection to the final use: attend this speech to discover all the steps and the innovative features that brought these projects to success.

[Music]

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
thank you for joining me today for this

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,840
presentation

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,520
i will show you some real use cases of

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,960
big data exploitation

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,240
using knowledge these use cases we refer

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
to unhealthcare

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,360
and energy market examples

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,800
let's just introduce myself my name is

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
marco cortelle

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
i work for engineering engineering

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,879
informatica

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
and i work for the knowledge labs in

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,719
turin

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,239
i'm a solution designer and usually i

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,440
work with clients

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,800
for bi projects and data visualization

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,920
project

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,360
but let's see some detail about what is

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
knowledge

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,160
knowledge is a free open source business

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,680
intelligence suite

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,439
that is usable under the agpl license

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,799
3.0 it's a web application that uses

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
open standards

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
and that you can directly use inside

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
your browser

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
with knowledge you can connect to any

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
type of

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,600
data sources you want for example big

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
data sources

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,000
open data and traditional relational

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,560
databases of course the scope

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
of knowledge is to give insights from

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
data

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
so you can create some data

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
visualization

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,280
and dashboard to give to get value

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,640
from your data of course not just

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,920
normal data you can also show

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,079
and display geographical information

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
so we have a module about location

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,159
intelligence

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,520
but is also possible to extract

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,719
more from your data so using advanced

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,479
analytics

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,119
using machine learning and deep learning

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
algorithms

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
as i told you before norwich is a full

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,160
bl suite

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
that means that you have multiple types

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
of document

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,280
and analysis that you can make so you

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
can have interactive dashboard

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,200
but also create kpis or maybe static

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,040
report that you can schedule

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
of course it's also possible to make

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
that exploration

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
using different type of engines like for

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
example the

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,680
query by example tool or maybe

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
the all app for multi-dimensional

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,760
analysis

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,080
of course it's also possible to assign

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
and make visible only the portion of

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,959
data that you want

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
to specific type of users

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
in the last version we added some new

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
feature

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,800
to let the user create beautiful

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,319
dashboard so it's possible to create

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
html with css widgets

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
but also possible to use custom

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
libraries

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
in new type for new type of

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,480
visualization so for example

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,519
you can integrate also code coming from

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,879
r and python script and of course

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,599
if you want to have some more advanced

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,640
way to navigate your data it's possible

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
to use

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,640
a fast and full search type of widget

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,120
called discovery widget using solar

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,319
indexes

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,959
to let you see how

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
how a dashboard is created you can see

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
this example

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
so we combine different type of data

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,959
sources

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,159
and also different type of widgets

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,720
so you can see combining html widget

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
for displaying some beautiful cards and

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
you can also combine it with custom

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,319
charts

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
from different types of visualization

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
library

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
and also integrate python widgets for

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
your

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,799
code to analysis to make analysis in

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
your

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,200
data as you can see in this

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
little gallery it's possible to create a

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,080
very

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,519
different type of dashboards

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,320
and also it's possible to make whatever

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,519
type of

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
look and feel you want

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:27,680
today we i will talk about two examples

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
that we had in a healthcare scenario

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,520
and the energy market scenario let's see

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
the first one

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,759
we have a client that needed to

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,040
monitor and manage the clinical

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
examination

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
and reports coming from an health

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
company that

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,720
that had a lot of clinical laboratories

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,040
and also the our client want to monitor

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,479
the usage of diagnostic devices

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,919
during the world day so

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,120
our solution was to first of all collect

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
integrate and process all the data

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
coming from one

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,720
or more clinical laboratories

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
to get data that can be used in real

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
time

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,639
but also for historical analysis

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,520
from the starting of this project we

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,039
managed like

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,479
158 million analysis

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,520
for like 5 billions of rows of data

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,039
then of course we add a lot of data but

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,800
then we want to give

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,759
access an easy way to access information

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,240
from this data using some reports and

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,680
interactive dashboard

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,800
so the result of our solution

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
let healthcare staff monitor what is

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,280
come what is happening

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,120
inside each laboratories and monitor the

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,919
working performances

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,319
in reports 24 hours per day

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
and also our solution let labs manager

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,960
monitor the level

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,240
of quality of the service provided and

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,280
when some um when the party

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,000
was below some predefined threshold they

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,039
can take

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
action to improve quality in real time

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
if you want to know more about the

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,240
stories that i told you today

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
and also to know more about all the type

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
of

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,720
success stories that we made using

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
knowledge with our clients

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
there is a specific page on our website

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,199
that you can see

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,199
on this url so feel free

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,440
to navigate in our website and maybe

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
have an idea of what you can do with

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
knowledge

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,080
let's see the other example our client

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,840
built a a non-intrusive load monitoring

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,759
device that when installed in the user's

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,080
home we let monitor the electrical power

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,280
consumption

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,560
the scope of this device

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,599
is to give useful suggestions to the

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
user

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
in order to reduce the energy

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
consumption

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,520
and save money so

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,479
also here we started by the data

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,080
so we transformed information collected

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,759
from this device

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,960
and we stored the data inside a big data

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,400
solution

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,000
then of course we want to extract value

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,039
from the data collected so we created

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,520
some machine learning techniques

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
in order to extract the energy

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,599
consumption

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,560
not just of the global home but

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,120
of each supplies installed installed in

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
the home

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
of the user and then of course we want

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
to show

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,440
the real important information

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,120
in an easy way so every user also

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,520
without technical skill

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,960
can have a full understanding of what is

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,960
happening and take action

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,520
so with our solution is possible using

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,080
interactive dashboard have an idea of

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,599
what is

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,639
happening inside the home with real time

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,360
and periodic insights on what is the

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,879
global

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
consumption but also have information

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
about

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,200
each single appliance consumption

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,760
so for example if you have an older

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,880
refrigerator that consumes a lot of

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,519
energy you can take action and

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
maybe think about or buy a new one that

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,720
is more energy friendly

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,519
of course the solution is useful to let

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,120
the user

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,760
save resources and money but also

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,720
to prevent incident when there is some

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
anomaly

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,320
in the energy consumption

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
of course this kind of solution was

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,399
stated was tested

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
tested by energy supplier and can be

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
offered

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,640
in the energy supply package

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,920
that they can sell to the users

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,120
the same solution can also be applied

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,839
to different scenario for example not

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
just

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,680
building home buildings but also to

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,680
manufacturing plants

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,559
okay but let's make a um

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,559
[Music]

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,640
let's point it out we had a lot of big

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,080
data

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,800
and so a lot of data that was collected

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
in the two uh example that i showed to

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
you

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
but what is really important is to

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
extract

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,320
value from the data not just collect the

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,080
data itself

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,519
so we have to remember that every time

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,880
at the end of the process what you have

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,279
is to communicate information valuable

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,800
information to human beings

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,920
and to do so we use techniques like

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,120
data visualization and interaction

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,480
to give real value for from

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,800
for the user from the data that was

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,560
collected

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,440
so thank you for joining me today

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720
for this presentation i would like to

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
remember that

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
the version 8 of knowledge is coming but

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,079
you can also find

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,880
another talk about these topics

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
from my colleague david zepeto that has

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
shown

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,839
the new features of knowledge thank you

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,839
