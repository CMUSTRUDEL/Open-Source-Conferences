Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Thomas Gageik talks about how open source has professionalised over the past years in Europe, how the time is now to step up the engagement between the European Commission and Europe's open source service providers. He talks about SMEs, which contribute more to open source which proves the point for industry associations suchs as OW2, CNLL and OSBA. He highlights the Commission's open source solutions and contributions, including a few that have reached much deeper into European public services and industry than most of us are aware, creating opportunities for open source companies.
