Title: [Keynote] Thomas Gageik, Director Digital Business Solutions (DIGIT.B), European Commission
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Thomas Gageik talks about how open source has professionalised over the past years in Europe, how the time is now to step up the engagement between the European Commission and Europe's open source service providers. He talks about SMEs, which contribute more to open source which proves the point for industry associations suchs as OW2, CNLL and OSBA. He highlights the Commission's open source solutions and contributions, including a few that have reached much deeper into European public services and industry than most of us are aware, creating opportunities for open source companies.

[Music]

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,840
good morning to everyone joining us

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
online

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,680
leveraging the european open source

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,439
ecosystem

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,760
ow 2 picked the right title to cedric

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
and to others who have joined him at ow

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,000
2 over its past decade

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,320
to all those that look closely at the

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,880
shadow for this two-day conference

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,000
something has changed in 2012

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,840
open source was seen as the

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,320
alternative in 2016 in 2017

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,640
delivering open source and making it

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,559
mainstream was captured as

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,840
a challenge but things are different now

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,600
today and tomorrow are about acting

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,760
effectively the lever the beam

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
that is open source has become long

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
enough and strong enough

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,439
to move the world this morning we're

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
going to hear about the economic

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
contributions of open source

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
knud blind and his colleagues are about

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
to publish their excellent study for the

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,159
european commission

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,600
this study tells me i have to thank you

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,840
the ow two participants most

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,360
of you being european open source

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,240
businesses

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
every euro you have invested in open

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
source

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,840
has contributed between 65

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,600
to 95 euros to european

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,880
gdp i trust this

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,840
study will positively influence european

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
policy

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,479
and similarly i hope that policy makers

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,759
in the member states

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,799
take good note of it this conference

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,640
is looking far ahead there are several

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
talks and discussions about how to

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
ensure the sustainability of the

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,200
ecosystem

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
the commission is involved and we are

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,119
working

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
on deepening our engagement you will be

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,680
discussing

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,040
technological sovereignty and we

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
are very keen on that too and we look

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,319
forward

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
to hear about this i also welcome

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
continuous review and monitoring

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
of the free and open source licensing

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
landscape

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,400
newcomers and changing business

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
practices

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
require ongoing attention to make sure

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
that this

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
landscape continues to match the

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
long-term interests

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
of the free and open source software

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,519
ecosystem

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
the commission as the creator and

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
maintainer

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,080
of the european public license upl

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,920
has a particular interest in this topic

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
this conference tells me that the

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
european open source

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,400
industry has professionalized

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
it is a community that thrives on

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
passion

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
for the values and ideas that underpin

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,760
open source

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,040
free minds working together pursuing

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,239
a shared goal but you have

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,400
outgrown pure advocacy groups

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,720
and you have turned into an industry

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
open source has developed from being

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,159
just an alternative

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,480
into a credible business proposition

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,360
as the director of digital business

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
solutions

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
at the director general for informatics

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
or

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,440
short digit and you can roughly think of

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
us as the in-house i.t of the european

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,000
commission

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,879
this professionalization of yours is

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
music

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,439
to my ears it is time to strengthen

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,640
our cooperation with europe's creative

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,360
open source companies we

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
as a user are getting ready and it seems

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
to me

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
so are you

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,040
the open source ecosystem and thus

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,560
this conference now also includes

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,400
big organizations i.t vendors and users

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
it's great to see here as well the city

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,799
of paris

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
the interaction of the entire community

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,960
in this

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
ecosystem sets an example as policy

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,080
makers

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:34,320
as users and as producers of open source

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,440
but as knut blind will show in this talk

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,680
it is mostly smes that contribute to

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,759
open source

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
over three quarters of companies

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,040
involved in open source have less than

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
100 employees

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,000
and what's more the smaller the company

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,600
the more contribution it makes to use

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,479
this potential for innovation and

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,240
contribution this is why industry

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,000
consortia such as

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,080
ow2 cnnl osba

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,199
must find their way into european

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,880
initiatives

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
such as the gaiax

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,120
speaking of european projects this april

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
we began we the commission began using

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
dissident

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
the citizen participation software

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,240
developed by the city of barcelona

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,520
for the future of europe conference our

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
instance of the sit-in

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
will run for one year it was unveiled

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,120
just a few weeks ago

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
it has already received ideas and

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,080
suggestions

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,720
from 14 000 participants over the next

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
11 months this open source software will

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
be touched and used

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,520
by many citizens companies and public

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,120
services in europe

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,800
the future of europe is running on open

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,560
source and this

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
is emblematic i say this because open

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
source

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
has become much more visible at the

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
european commission

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,960
we already use a lot of open source

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
you find it all over my organization

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,880
digit it is dominant in our data center

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,919
and we use drupal nearly everywhere our

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,440
software development

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,160
environment relies on open source

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
for two decades colleagues at the isa

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
square program

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
have been busy encouraging open source

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,639
in projects with the member states

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,800
and it is most the most practical way to

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,039
achieve

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,680
interoperability and since october last

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,680
year

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
we have a new version of our internal

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,560
open source strategy

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,919
its status elevated as a communication

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,960
to the commission open source

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,000
has become more much more

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,240
than a practical you tool for us

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,919
in it the commission recognizes this

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,720
through linking it to policy goals

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,639
as an action within our new strategy we

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
also launched our open source program

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,599
office

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,639
osbo for short one of the first tasks

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,720
handed over to the ospo is to make it

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,599
easier for the commission to share

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
its software as open source and that

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
includes for instance just a security

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
check

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
i'm pleased to announce that as of this

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
summer just a few months

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
after we started the osbo we are about

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
to have

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,440
new rules in place i will spare you the

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,000
details but for each project

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
we are removing the need for many weeks

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,520
of paperwork

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
and removing some legal barriers to

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,360
share our code

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
with the public they also make it easy

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,759
for our developers

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,879
to contribute to open source the osbo

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,840
has been key

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
to the removal of another barrier and

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
this one

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,879
entirely internal the ospo

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,440
makes it easy to liaise with industry

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
groups

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,840
such as ow2 and other organizations

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,840
like on the other end of the spectrum

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,199
the united nations

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
the u.n will soon come up with their own

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
vision

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
on open source and we are looking for

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,919
opportunities to collaborate

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,960
on for example hackathons likewise we

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,879
intend to work

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,759
with the french and german governments

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,680
both gearing up towards an hospital

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
in cooperation with our colleagues from

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,599
eiser square

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
the ospo team organized a hackathon with

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,560
jitsi

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,560
adding new features such as creating

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,760
breakout rooms and organizing quick

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,680
polls

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,680
the ospo team has been running bug

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,200
bounties for zimbra

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,040
moodle element improving the security of

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
these tools

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
it is initiating studies one

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
an inventory of critical open source

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
software used by european public

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,480
services and

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,120
two a study to look at ways

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,560
to fund sustainability of open source

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,839
development

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,959
it shows our commitment to open source

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,360
it is a signal to open source service

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,000
providers to entrepreneurs and startups

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
and also to our colleagues in the member

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,399
states

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,000
now let me come to my final point i must

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,399
talk to you

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,800
about the digital europe program

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,920
it builds on two programs that you may

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
know already

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
the isa square program and the

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,120
connecting europe facility or

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
short ceph that is because isa square

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
and sev

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,839
and soon the digital euro program have

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,800
been and will be

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
imprinting open source on public

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,640
services

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,279
across the european union

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
over the years isa square has been very

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
active on open source for one

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,160
it has been running the commission's

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,399
open source observatory since 2003

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
this provides expertise and information

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,079
to public services and support them

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,560
to adopt open source

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
in fact this afternoon you can meet the

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,720
ozark team

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,839
and hear about their work on open source

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,040
communication in the public sector

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
the other program ceph one way to

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
describe it is

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
that the solution that it funds remove

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
digital barriers

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,760
to the european market it created

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,399
digital building blocks

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,720
generic and reusable that help member

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,920
states deliver digital services across

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,079
borders and sectors seph usually

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,880
emphasizes the use

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,920
of common standards but what you may not

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,440
know

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,040
is all of the ceph software

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,800
is open source ceph

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
sponsored the development of open source

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,560
software components that help

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,880
for instance with import declarations

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,079
before you can import goods you know

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
containers

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,839
information has to be submitted

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
electronically

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
helping customs decide for example in

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
safety and security risks

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
it means that open source software

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,320
reaches

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
all custom authorities or companies that

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,920
import

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,120
goods into europe either in the eu

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,360
or in countries outside ceph delivered

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
an api built around universal business

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
language

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,920
and using open source xml technology for

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
companies

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,040
involved in the production of steel

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,320
purchase orders dispatch advices

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,839
invoices product certificates this

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
api is the software for it

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,279
these have been adopted by a consortium

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
of companies

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,519
involved in the steel industry and is

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,839
reaching

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,519
a lot of many steel producers warehouses

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,600
stockholders construction companies

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,360
steer processing industry and

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,320
software companies other cell tools

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
are reaching fintech companies and in

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,519
smart agriculture

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
firms and those working on the

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,399
utilization of

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,600
electronic signature you see

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
how this creates opportunities for open

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,399
source companies

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:28,079
including i hope many of you

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,079
now public services you may tease us for

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,120
not going fast but that is for good

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,880
reasons

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,760
it's because we have to go far

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
we have to work together when it comes

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,800
to

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:50,639
i t open source makes that possible

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,639
