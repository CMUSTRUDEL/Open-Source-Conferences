Description: 
	ReachOut is a Coordination and Support Action (CSA) helping H2020 projects, European SME and Open Source projects to implement beta-testing campaigns. The ReachOut platform provides a comprehensive set of tools for preparing, implementing and following your beta-testing campaign. Beta testers can be rewarded with the ReachOut Hall of Fame, money prizes as well as dedicated project incentives. The ReachOut project team is here to help campaign managers throughout the whole process. And itâ€™s all brought to you for free! We will present the different stages of the test{fest}, a ReachOut initiative to promote beta-testing campaigns and encourage beta testers to participate, and the results of the first spring 2021 edition.
