Description: 
	ReachOut is a Coordination and Support Action (CSA) helping H2020 projects, European SME and Open Source projects to implement beta-testing campaigns. The ReachOut platform provides a comprehensive set of tools for preparing, implementing and following your beta-testing campaign. Beta testers can be rewarded with the ReachOut Hall of Fame, money prizes as well as dedicated project incentives. The ReachOut project team is here to help campaign managers throughout the whole process. And itâ€™s all brought to you for free! We will present the different stages of the test{fest}, a ReachOut initiative to promote beta-testing campaigns and encourage beta testers to participate, and the results of the first spring 2021 edition.

chat for the link to the dedicated chat

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
reach out is a three-year coordination

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
and support action funded by the

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,320
european commission

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,360
it started in january 2019 and will end

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,480
at the end of this year

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,039
fraunhofer focus coordinates the project

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,280
and the other two partners are w2 and

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,600
ushasoft

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,199
our goal in reach out is to help

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
european research projects

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,680
but also european smes and any open

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
source project

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
develop market value and reach out to

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
the end users

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,600
by developing their own beta testing

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,600
campaigns

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
a bit of context creating value for

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,920
projects

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
means more than simply producing

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
software and project deliverables

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
this is what we call the delivery

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
challenge

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,439
there are many more project attributes

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,320
which are listed on this

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,680
slide which create value for project

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
results

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
as we will see better testing helps

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,960
developing those product attributes

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
and thus it increases the market value

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,759
of the project

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
better testing is a key phase in a

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,479
software development cycle

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,560
after the initial alpha version which is

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
internal to the project

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
and before the product is ready the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,439
better version

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,879
is to be tested by external end users

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,399
over a short period of time this is what

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,959
a better testing campaign

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,959
is about

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
beta testing has many benefits

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
the most obvious ones are that beta

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,920
testing provides feedback

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,720
which can be used to increase the

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,879
quality of the product

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
feedback provided by external beta

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,640
testers

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,640
is also very useful to identify future

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
exploitation opportunities of the

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,920
project results

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
less obvious better testing provides a

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
focus point

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
that helps align the efforts and the

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,080
expectations

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,560
of all the project partners

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
and finally better testing helps

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
enforcing

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
those other necessary product attributes

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,200
such as documentation

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,239
packaging support and thus

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,800
it increases the overall project value

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
we like to say that for a project to be

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
able to develop

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
and implement its own beta testing

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,319
campaign is an

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,319
important milestone it proves

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,720
that the project has what it takes to

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,480
engage with external actors

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,680
users partners to bring value to the

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
market

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,400
and to start developing its own

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
ecosystem

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
the reach out team is available to help

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,159
projects

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,280
define set up and execute

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
their beta testing campaigns we provide

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
you with

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
a methodology a set of tools and

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
templates

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,120
as well as support during the whole time

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,920
frame of the campaign

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
also reach out can provide gifts for

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,319
better testers

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,799
and we have organized the test test

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,280
before i go into more details please

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
note that all the services provided by

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
reach out

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
are completely free

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,360
so at reach out we have developed a

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
whole five-stage methodology

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
to help you implement your own beta

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,000
testing campaign

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
this means deciding the objectives of

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
the campaign

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
and the roles of each partner then

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
preparing the software for better

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
testing

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
the testing scenario and the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
questionnaire

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,800
writing the documentation and

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
communication material

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,520
engaging with the beta testers

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
themselves and managing them

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,720
and finally analyzing the results and

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,919
sharing them

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,360
the methodology is available in detail

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
on the reach out website

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
so we have developed all the necessary

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,919
tools and templates

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,479
for each of a campaign building block

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
those are available in what we call the

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,000
reach out better center

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,000
let's now go into more details

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,320
campaign managers can self-register on

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
the reach out beta center

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
they are given their own campaign

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
manager page from which

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,800
they can access the resources provided

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,120
by reach out

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
the campaign manager enters all the

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,080
campaign details in a form

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,960
provided on the richard beta center this

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,080
includes the description of the campaign

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,639
the expected testing duration

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
the target profile of expected beta

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,360
testers

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
the campaign start and end dates the

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,560
requirements

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,000
for better testers the testing scenario

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
links to installation instructions and

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,960
documentations

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,639
as well as the incentives for taking

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,759
part in the beta testing campaign

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,960
from this form a campaign page

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,720
will be generated automatically together

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,919
with the associated questionnaire for

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,240
better testers

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,240
as well as a dedicated mailing list

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
reachout also provides campaign managers

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,319
with

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
a monitoring dashboard this dashboard

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
contains

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
24 checkpoints which are about the

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,840
management

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,919
the preparation and the execution of the

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,639
campaign

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,400
the monitoring dashboard can be used as

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
a checklist

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
it can also be used to monitor the

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,199
progress of the campaign together

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,120
with the reach out project team or to

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
communicate with the partners

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,680
and the reviewers

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,199
when a campaign is created the rich

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
alberta center generates

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,800
a questionnaire which is based

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,319
on a template containing a balance mixed

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
of 34 opened

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
and closed questions the questions are

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
organized in sections

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
respect respectively about setting up

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,560
the testing environment

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,479
functional feedback user experience

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,919
possible next steps a general summary

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,520
and finally the beta tester profiling

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,120
the questionnaire is entirely

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,759
customizable

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
you can remove questions reword

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,319
questions

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
add questions it also supports multiple

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,880
languages

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,199
for multilingual questionnaires

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,400
for each feedback returned by a beta

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
tester

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,639
the campaign manager receives an email

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,280
message

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,240
responses can also be visualized online

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
including statistics and graphs

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,960
and they can also be exported in various

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
formats

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
the reachout beta center also provides

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
other tools

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
those include templates for

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,400
documentation

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,919
recommendations for packaging as well as

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,840
a packaging tool the recharge factory

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,080
a communication package with several

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,479
templates

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,479
fine prints and a reporting package

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,440
so typically a better testing campaign

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,319
can take between three to five months

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
depending on how ready you already are

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
and how much

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
efforts will be required to attract the

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,919
better testers

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,399
the first phase of preparation takes

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
usually one to two months

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,800
then you can count one to two months for

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,479
the execution itself that means engaging

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,279
with the beta testers

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,760
and finally one month for analyzing the

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,760
results

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
the task of recruiting better testers

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,360
starts with your project

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,040
and your own ecosystem of partners

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
students are often a good source of

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,600
better testers

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
reach out also provides you with its own

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
ecosystem
