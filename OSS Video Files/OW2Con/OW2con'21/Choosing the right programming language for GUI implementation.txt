Description: 
	Python, C / C ++, JavaScript or Java? What is the best language for your embedded GUI? Choosing the programming language to be used in your embedded GUI is a decision that depends on several factors. In general, you should look for languages ​​that developers are familiar with, in order to spend less time learning new technology. Also, the language must be suitable for the project objectives. High-level languages ​​- such as Python and JavaScript - tend to be easier to use and have more components available, which reduces time-to-market.. Low-level languages ​​- like C - require a little more work related to memory. However, it ensures high performance. Some intermediate languages ​​like C#, Java and Kotlin also bring frameworks that try to balance the best of both worlds: fast to development and low footprint and, therefore, high performance. In this session we will discuss use cases of GUI implementation for Linux Embedded and analyze the possibilities of languages ​​to be used. Main topics: - Pros and cons of the most used languages ​in GUI embedded development - Find out how to decide which language to use based in your project requirements - How new frameworks decrease development complexity while maintaining high performance and low footprint
