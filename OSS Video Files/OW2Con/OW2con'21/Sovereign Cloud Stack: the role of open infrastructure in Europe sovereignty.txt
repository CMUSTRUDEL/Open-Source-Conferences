Title: Sovereign Cloud Stack: the role of open infrastructure in Europe sovereignty
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	Open source has a critical role to play to enable sovereign infrastructure in Europe. This talk will explain what Open Infrastructure is, and how its interoperability, transparency and independence makes it an ideal fit for data and computing sovereignty. It will present how Gaia-X creates a framework for sovereign infrastructure services, and how Sovereign Cloud Stack bridges between Open Infrastructure and Gaia-X.

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
hello everyone

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
my name is thierry cares i work for the

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
open infrastructure foundation

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
which was previously known as the

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,720
openstack foundation

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
openstack is an open source framework to

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,000
build an alternative to the big

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,880
hyperscalers

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,920
and more recently we moved to supporting

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
more widely

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
open infrastructure which is why we

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
renamed to the open infrastructure

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,280
foundation

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,800
i'm based in france so the the questions

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,520
of digital sovereignty

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
are important to me the fact that most

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
hyperscales clouds like

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,920
amazon microsoft or google are all based

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,719
in the us

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
and that means your data is ultimately

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
controlled

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,320
by other jurisdictions

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
the theme for ow to con this year is

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,920
leveraging the european open source

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
ecosystem

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
so i've been wondering how can we

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
leverage the vibrant

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
european open source ecosystem to build

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,759
our digital sovereignty

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
that's where the idea of distal came

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,360
from

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
but first what do we mean by digital

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
sovereignty

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,720
why does it matter and how do we enable

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,720
it

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,119
the 21st century is driven by software

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,159
in a fast changing world whoever adapts

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,680
the fastest

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,119
wins and it's a question of disrupt

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,840
or be disrupted adapting fast means

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,159
shipping new features fast delivering

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,159
new applications fast

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
and the way you deliver those

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,719
applications

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,840
has been evolving 20 years ago you would

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,079
procure some physical hardware and as

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,920
an application deployer you would

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
install an operating system

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,959
your dependencies and your applications

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,760
directly on top of that

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,959
that took a lot of time and maintenance

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
work

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
so we started to add more abstractions

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,080
more layers

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,239
we added hardware virtualization

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,640
abstracting the server you're deploying

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
on

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,000
from the physical hardware that runs it

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
you gained a lot of efficiency doing

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
that

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,640
then we added cloud apis to allow to

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
programmatically access those

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,599
virtualized resources

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,879
so you have programmable infrastructure

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
on one side

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,640
and cloud aware applications being

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
deployed on top of that

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,440
this programmable infrastructure is key

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,599
to reach the next level of velocity

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
machines need to be able to provision

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,959
the resources they need

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,200
by themselves but building up

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
this programmable infrastructure by

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
yourself

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,239
is pretty hard it is complex to do

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
and it is difficult to hire people that

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
know how to do it

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,040
because there is a lot of demand for

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,760
those skills on the market

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,159
luckily you can pay others to do it for

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
you

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,799
thanks to public clouds but the trick is

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
the public cloud market is cornered by a

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
couple of

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,840
internet giants mostly based in the u.s

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
or

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,400
china so that creates a challenge

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,319
especially for european governments and

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,159
companies

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,720
the challenge is that to stay

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,519
competitive european companies need

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,040
access to programmable infrastructure

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,519
and the simplest way to do that is to

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,799
use a hyperscale cloud

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,159
public cloud based in the us

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,360
but data is the basic

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,760
resource of the 21st century and which

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
legislation the company that holds your

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,360
data is under

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,920
ultimately defines who controls it

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,000
the us government can compel a u.s

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,400
company to disclose their customer

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,799
data in case of a geopolitical conflict

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,360
the us government could shut down your

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,840
access to vital data

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
that creates a significant geopolitical

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,960
vulnerability

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,479
and if the last 10 years are any guide

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,440
that vulnerability

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,440
if left unaddressed will only grow

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,240
beyond that even assuming good intent

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,639
on those companies and governments

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
the jurisdiction under which your data

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
is held

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,919
controls which laws apply to it

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
and europe has very progressive privacy

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
laws

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,080
that protect individuals from the reach

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,880
of greedy data aggregation giants

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,160
how do we enforce those laws in a future

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,000
where all data

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,960
lives in places escaping those laws

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
the solution of course is to build our

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
own

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,520
european-based public clouds but it's

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,000
easier said than done

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
europe has a vibrant ecosystem of

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
companies

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
but it lacks the giants that can compete

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
with

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,919
google or amazon how can we

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
turn that vibrant ecosystem of smaller

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,800
actors

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,120
from a liability to an asset

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
germany and france have acknowledged

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
that critical

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
geopolitical vulnerability for a while

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,759
and

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,720
we had several attempts at building

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,600
giant sovereign clouds in the past

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,639
but they were not adapted to the nature

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,080
of the european ecosystem

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,120
a new initiative was launched last year

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,199
called gaia x

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,039
rather than trying to establish a new

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
giant from scratch

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,039
gaia x takes the problem from the other

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,160
end

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,600
how to enable a vibrant ecosystem of

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,960
smaller companies

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,319
to provide a rich coherent interoperable

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
service offering

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
one that encapsulates advanced privacy

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
laws

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,240
rather than works around them

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,639
gaia x is a framework to describe

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,800
infrastructure and data services

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
federate them into a single catalog

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,840
and make them interoperable

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,560
it allows to share identity across

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
services

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,800
and lets you specify the guarantees you

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520
want to apply to your data

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,919
in terms of geographical location or

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,440
encryption

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,160
gaiax is not a giant public cloud it's a

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
framework

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
to describe desperate smaller cloud

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
services

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,360
as a federated interoperable offering

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,800
turning that vibrant ecosystem of

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,639
smaller actors

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,800
from a liability to an asset

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,479
the code for the gaia x framework

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,240
specifications catalog of services

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
federal identity will be

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
open source but the infrastructure and

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
data services

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,199
that will be accessible through gaia x

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,639
can be proprietary but i think

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,639
open source has a role to play and

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,680
more specifically open infrastructure

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,199
open source solutions that provide

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,319
programmable infrastructure so

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,960
how can open infrastructure help

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,199
if we go back to our picture with

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,199
programmable infrastructure on one side

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
and cloud aware applications on the

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,160
other

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
open infrastructure is solutions that

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
help you provide

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,280
that programmable infrastructure

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,639
and more generally we serve that new

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
population that we call

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,680
infrastructure providers which is

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
distinct

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,759
from application developers and

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440
deployers

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,800
that is the movement we started with

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,039
openstack

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,960
and that has extended beyond openstack

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
now

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,080
so why use open source for

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,199
infrastructure why does it matter

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,120
well first it gives everyone

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
access to infrastructure providing

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,840
technology

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,640
all organizations all countries

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,000
it allows to distribute the future more

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,560
evenly

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,399
and by making those technologies

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,279
accessible to all

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
we allow everyone to play and innovate

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,959
without

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,360
friction or having to ask for permission

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,360
we basically maximize innovation

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
beyond those two key benefits there are

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
a number of

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
other key properties of open

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
infrastructure that makes it especially

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,959
suitable

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:08,080
to applying it to digital sovereignty

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,399
independence is one of them

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
open infrastructure is not just open

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
source

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,440
it's also openly developed that means

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
everyone can participate on a level

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
playing

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,080
field under neutral governance with

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
nobody

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,480
owning the keys to the kingdom

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:32,959
that independence and neutrality is key

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,240
to enable an interoperable ecosystem

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,360
another benefit of open development

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,080
is transparency all technical

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,000
discussions are happening in public

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,880
all project governance decisions are

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,680
also publicly documented

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
trust is essential in building software

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
and cloud

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,519
solutions and open infrastructure is

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,519
naturally transparent

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
finally being accessible to all means

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,519
that

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
everyone can standardize on the same

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
solution

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,399
enabling interoperability

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
interoperability is the main challenge

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,200
in federating smaller actors

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
it's really hard to eliminate the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,200
differences

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,760
and present a coherent user experience

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,279
standardizing on features is the first

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,000
layer

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,360
using the same apis is a layer above

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
that

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
using the same technical stack is even

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,519
better

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
but the ultimate level in

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,120
interoperability is to

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,200
use the same distribution and operation

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
stacks

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,519
and that's the challenge that server and

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
cloud stack aims to solve

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,640
server and cloud stack is an initiative

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
led by

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
cort garloff aiming to build a standard

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,880
stack

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,000
for providing sovereign infrastructure

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,279
it would be a complete gaiax compatible

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,240
programmable infrastructure solution

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
and by reusing that stack providers can

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,640
be sure to be compatible

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
and join a federation of interoperable

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,279
providers

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,959
the stack provides vms containers

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,800
kubernetes clusters

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,800
by integrating open infrastructure

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,240
solutions like openstack

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,480
kubernetes or ceph it is

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,519
highly opinionated which is the price to

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
pair to be

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,519
truly interoperable and

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,480
finally it is openly developed open

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
source

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
so it's open source of course but also

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
openly designed

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,480
openly developed under an open

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,800
governance model

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
several companies already joined this

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,279
initiative essentially from

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
germany and france at this stage like

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,560
deutsche telecom or ovh cloud

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,160
but we are seeing other european

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,120
companies like city network or stack hpc

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,120
join the initiative

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,920
so in summary digital sovereignty

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,360
is a major challenge for europe in the

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
21st century

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
we need a solution to turn an ecosystem

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,639
of smaller actors

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,680
from a liability to an asset

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240
gaia x is the european solution to

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
foster

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
this federation of smaller actors it

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
provides a way to specify your

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
requirements

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,360
and discover compatible infrastructure

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,680
and data processing services

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
open infrastructure is open source

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
infrastructure solutions for

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
applications data processing data

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,680
storage and networking

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,000
by being openly developed it enables

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,959
independence from single vendors

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,240
and transparency in decision making it

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
reduces friction

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
and gives everyone access to the

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
technology

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,360
allowing everyone to standardize on an

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,600
interoperable offering

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
sovereign cloud stack goes one step

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
further

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
by producing a standard distribution and

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,480
operational stack

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,839
compatible with gaia x that maximizes

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,000
interoperability for adopters of the

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
same stack

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
by doing so it facilitates the

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,839
federation of smaller actors

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,240
into a solid diverse and interoperable

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,639
offering

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
thank you for your attention and thanks

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,680
