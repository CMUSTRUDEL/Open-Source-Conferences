00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
hello everyone

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
and thank you for attending this

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
presentation

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
my name is philip and i am technical

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,960
project manager at the city of paris

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,559
i also work with our city cio as an open

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
source officer

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,760
first of all i would like to thank ow

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,320
two for having me today

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,239
and giving me a chance to tell about our

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,360
own platform and what's been new

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,039
this last couple years with this city

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,120
services platform called lutes

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,360
i won't go over the whole history of the

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840
project as you'll find my presentation

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,879
from 2019

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,359
on the owu 2 channel youtube channel

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,920
but i can't go any further without a

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
short

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
overview of what lutes is lutes is the

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,960
city of paris

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,799
signature city services engine that

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,560
provides a modular platform

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,320
based on light core features uh

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
lightweight core features on top of

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
which we can add

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,119
the needed functionalities through the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,439
use of plugins

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,720
to build our your own customized website

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,280
since 2002 it is freely available

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,799
as the console of paris voted to

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,520
outsource its code

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
since public money should found public

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,200
code

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
as municipalities share probably more

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
than

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,240
70 percent of their digital needs and

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,520
don't have the same means

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,799
to implement and run our software

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
it's it seemed obvious that the for the

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
elected

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,520
team to share and be able to connect

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
with other administrations through our

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,920
software

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,040
to have it evolve and share the cost

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,680
of its maintenance so of course

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,280
it is based on real needs and it is

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
always updated

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,080
with either new functionalities or fixes

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,800
and upgrades this year the platform will

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,879
blow its

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
20 candles and offers more than 200 city

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,879
services

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,920
through 500 plus standard

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
plugins the tools and documentation to

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
develop

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,640
on the normed development framework

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,560
among the available plugins there are

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
full multi-step form

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,959
builders with elaborate workflows

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,120
that allow the users to save drafts

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
upload documents for any type of

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
administrative

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,959
procedures and there's also an

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
appointment booking system that's used

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,560
for more than 400

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
shared agendas within all the city

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,760
departments

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,959
there is also a crm our citizen

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,319
relationship management which caused it

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,519
is also reused for hr purposes

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
on our intranet

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,239
in the municipality we need our elected

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,040
officials to understand and sponsor

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,519
this culture of open source so back in

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,239
2002 we strongly but they strongly

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
believed

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
that public money should benefit other

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,080
municipalities

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
or administrations and therefore

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
citizens would only pay

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
once for the public code this is how

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
lutes was born

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,239
the license we chose for our signature

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
service platform was bsd

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
to facilitate as much as possible its

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
adoptions reuses

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
and contributions our goal is not to

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
protect our code

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,480
but to make it as easy as possible for

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,720
anyone to join and contribute

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,599
so the key factors which are important

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,360
for us

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
and that promotes the use of open source

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
are

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
firstly trust open source establishes

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
trust and

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
transparency between citizens and public

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,799
services

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,560
when you set a digital service factory

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,160
you need to make sure citizens

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
trust you as a city so that they use the

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
service

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
and support you in the digital

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
transition

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
then we also support the fact that when

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,919
we

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,759
use public money we should therefore

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,560
as far as possible provide public code

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,080
sharing and collaborating between cities

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,280
and administrations bring

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,000
progress by promoting reuse

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,440
money savings and so on and working

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,960
together enables

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,000
richer smarter flexible software

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
developments

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,199
adapted to the common needs and concerns

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,120
of citizens

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,639
cities have their own means to regain

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,039
control over

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,039
their digital services including cost

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,680
and privacy control

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,400
so they must work together in the same

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,240
direction

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,600
for digital sovereignty and independence

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,560
having control on our digital services

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
help us reuse our developments we are

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,039
not

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
forced to pay again and again for the

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,960
same things

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,360
this means we need to always keep in

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
mind

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,240
how to build in order to be reused

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,759
this is very cultural so whenever we

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
need to launch a new service

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,800
we only focus focus on what's new and

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
reuse what can be

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
this is how the participatory budgeting

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,199
could be made in only a few months

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,759
it's a cultural it's a culture

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,759
that is deeply rooted in our practices

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560
so i won't have time unfortunately to

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,759
name all of them

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,160
the upgrades that were made among the

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,360
hundreds of plugins that are available

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,840
so let me focus on lotus core where new

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,720
efforts were made

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,639
on what is soon to be released as

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
version seven anytime this year

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,880
hopefully

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,360
purchase particularly important in the

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,960
context of an administrative

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,840
we worked on allowing the activation of

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
the logs

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,840
of all the actions made either in buck

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,720
or and front offices easily

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
also thanks to contributions that were

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
made

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,360
and very welcome recently upgrades were

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
also made to allow external

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
configuration management

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,319
on cloud infrastructures

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,720
we changed the implementation of the use

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,000
of css frameworks especially

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,520
in back offices which is also possible

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,199
in front obviously

00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,000
but to give a new level of abstraction

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,360
to be able to switch the css frameworks

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,479
without changing the templates

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,639
finally we had some shortcomings um

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
in our management of the international

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,039
association

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,720
so new contributions also fixed our

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,919
handling of the locale

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
time zones and so on since we actually

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,599
never had this

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,599
need before

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,080
community wise i am personally very

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
pleased

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,720
to share that our project lutes has

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
received the 2020 ow

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
to best project community award this

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,639
award

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
is important to us it recognizes our

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,520
efforts to engage

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,080
with the open source ecosystem in doing

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
so we follow the ow to good governance

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
model

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
that aims at leveraging open source to

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
create

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,919
value within our communities

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
a few new users and contributors joined

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
the community

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,960
some just integrated a few features on

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
the core

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,319
and some offered as i mentioned earlier

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
their help

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,360
in our management of the locale time

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,960
zone sas features and so on

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
so lutes is offered to undergraduate

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,759
students at the johns hopkins university

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,400
based in baltimore in the u.s

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,680
and after a year-long contribution they

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,240
will soon host

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,919
a lutes website for a local ngo to use

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,479
and we're very proud of msi the city of

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,959
budapest now also decided to take over

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,240
utes and reuse some of its participatory

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
budgeting solution

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
to launch their own so we're very

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,159
excited to soon have

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,959
lu tescore and a few other plug-ins

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,160
available in hungarian

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,279
at last interesting last

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,640
interesting recent adoption is directly

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,959
related to the health

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,519
crisis that we all know when visiting

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,519
residents in medical facilities has

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,399
become a challenge for the staff

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,440
but also for the residents who cannot

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,640
remain

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,959
as isolated from their relatives

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
so last year lutes was deployed on a

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,519
nursing home website

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
to book visits

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
so how would you join and contribute to

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,600
the project

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,640
as for any other open source project

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
please visit our website

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,880
bluetest.paris.fr

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,320
to learn more and how

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,680
you could contribute to the project

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
you will notice that its whole design

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,399
has been redone

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,080
and the website is more explicit on what

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
the platform is all about

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,760
rather than just a technical

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,240
documentation website

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,440
so we would be pleased to welcome anyone

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
as a new user

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
contributor to already the existing

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,360
plugins or module

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:01,120
as well as new ones of course last year

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,399
we brought our first mooc to also lower

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
the technical step

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
to integrate and develop on lutes even

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,560
if you don't have any

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,160
technical skills we would always

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
appreciate efforts

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,000
on the on the supported languages and

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
backtracking of course

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,320
i would like to thank you all for your

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:27,600
attention and

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,600
