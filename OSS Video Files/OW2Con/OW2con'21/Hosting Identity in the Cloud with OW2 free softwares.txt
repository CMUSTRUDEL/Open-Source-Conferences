Title: Hosting Identity in the Cloud with OW2 free softwares
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: OW2con'21
Description: 
	We see a major migration of internal IT services to the cloud, and IAM (Identity & Access Management) is one of them. Identity in the Cloud is also knows as IDaaS and no real open source solution is today available to built such solution. Well, almost none... We will see in this presentation how to run some OW2 softwares like LemonLDAP::NG, LSC, LDAP Tool Box or Fusion Directory to build such solution.

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,720
hello and welcome to this session

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,640
which will be about hosting identity in

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
the cloud with

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,359
rw23 softwares

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,559
first some words about me so

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,840
my name is clemento and i'm identity

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
solution manager

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
by vortex i work a lot

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,040
on free software you may know some of

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
them

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,320
most are about identity management and

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,280
most of them are hosted by aw2

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
so lemonade app which is a single signup

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,039
product

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,239
under toolbox lsc fusion em

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,280
which will be the software which will be

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,560
presented today and w suite

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,600
which is a collaborative suite

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,280
for mail agenda

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,320
chat etc i'm also

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,640
doing some stuff in my personal life

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,759
so i just put here a cover of my first

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
music album if you want to hear it you

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,040
can go to

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
captain on my website

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,479
now we will talk about im

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,479
what is im im means identity and

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,920
access management identity management

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,320
is all that covers how to manage

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
the user identity in the information

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,040
system

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
so you you first have to to manage the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,600
account it's creation and

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
deletion what it's what we call the live

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
second management

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,719
and also how you will be able to

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,239
copy and forward this identity

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,599
into information system we can

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
also put in identity management how the

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,480
user itself

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,840
will manage its data it includes

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,080
its password of course we also talked

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,319
about identity reconciliation

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,599
which means how we gather data from a

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,560
different data warehouse and

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,720
we know that all this data belongs to

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,599
the same user

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,879
another point is access management so

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,200
access management

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
is quite different with access

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,680
management

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,720
we try to to give permission to users

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,680
to give them rights to to access to

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
application to stacks of the information

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
system

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
the last point is very important is the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,560
audit so we

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,480
we need to know what the user has done

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,239
inside the application small focus about

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,040
identity life sql you see that it's just

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
the journey between the acme creation

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
and the icon deletion

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,840
the icon deletion is very important in

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,120
identity management because we

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
we need to know what to do when a user

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
leaves

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,200
the organization so identity management

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
tries to

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,280
to offer stools to to properly

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
delete an account and advertise all

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,720
softwares

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
that this user is no longer being part

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
of the

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,280
organization what about the

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,319
im market as you can see on a lot of

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,720
studies most of im market

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,080
is taken by big big close source editors

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,519
mostly american companies we have really

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,159
really

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
few european companies in this

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,200
equivalent

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
you can see that we have atos and

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,480
evidence but

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,920
these are still close source

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
editors these softwares from these

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,359
editors

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,320
are very complex they cover a very wide

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
spectrum of features but they are very

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,840
complex

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,280
and of course they are cloud source and

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,040
you you must pay

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,160
to to use them what about open source

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
in identity and access management of

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
course

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,400
there are a lot of open source product

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
that covers

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
some part of identity management or some

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,479
part of

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
access management but there are no

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
really

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,880
a full open source product that covers

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
the full spectrum

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,639
of identity and access management each

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
of these products

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,720
are maintained by different companies

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
many of them don't integrate each

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
other's

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
of course we have we have a standards

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,080
standard protocols

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
but it's maybe not enough to to have a

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,759
full

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,880
united states with a fusion here

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,160
im we we decided to join some

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,919
softwares and to have only free software

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,400
on open source software

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,360
but software that are backed by

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,560
companies

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,919
and this fusion em software is

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,720
also in rw2

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,520
so you we can see here that we join

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
together

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,960
a lot of open source projects and

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,759
a lot of them are already inside rw2

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,199
only open lap which is a famous lab

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
directory server

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
is not hosted by ow youtube but all of

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
this software

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,960
are part of aw2

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
to present them quickly lsc is a

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
connector you can

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
synchronize your data from for example

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,000
active directory to

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,120
open end up ldap toolbox is a lot of

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,080
products like openlab package or

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
web interface to change password like

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
subservice password

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
version directory is a web interface to

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
manage

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,840
the data that are in the adapt directory

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,560
and lemonade g is the single sign-on

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,120
software

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,000
it's the access management stack of

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
fusion ii

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
what are the main features of all the

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
software together

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
we we have in a version erm

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
authentication portal

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
application menu we have second factor

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,160
authentication

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
white pages which is a small application

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
to display

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,520
all the data from the directory to to

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,720
end users

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,840
service desk which is a small software

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,080
to help the support to unlock accounts

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,400
of users we have user group management

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
we have cast sample and open id connect

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,360
protocols

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,560
and of course some web services

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
now we will talk about the cloud because

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,479
version

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,199
im is a software it is a union of

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,800
several softwares that can be installed

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,000
on your own servers

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,080
but we are working to have them

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,280
in the cloud a first word

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,720
you may already have heard is idas

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,039
it means identity as a service it's

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
the software as a service but dedicated

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,479
to identity management and access

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
management

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,120
so why choosing the cloud some benefits

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,919
are if you opt for a cloud solution you

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,560
don't need to

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,599
to do any installation or you don't need

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
any server

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,879
all the software will be hosted by

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,759
another company

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
and you will have some availability and

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
scalability

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,560
you don't have to buy your own servers

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
to

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
increase the performance of the identity

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,039
application

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
but of course we have some drawbacks

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
like

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,759
the fact that the data is hosted by

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,720
another company

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
and the integration with your internal

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400
information system

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
is of course more difficult because you

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
will not

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,759
host your identity and access management

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
server inside your information system

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
reversibility is not always easy it

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,199
means if you want to leave

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
your identity as a service hoster you

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
you need to

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,440
get back your identity data

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,560
a word about isolation and multi-tenancy

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,360
we choose with fusion iim to

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
to have a isolation model it means we

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,279
will

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,560
instantiate each software for each

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
companies

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,839
instead of having only a big server with

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,760
one software but used by several

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,279
companies

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,360
in our infrastructure stack we will

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,560
build our images we will build

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
containers

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,959
with sport manual docker and we will use

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,480
ansible to deploy

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,600
all the components in this images

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,480
we run we want this container

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
with pod manual up and shift and we have

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
some

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,320
images registry the default one is

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,550
on value 2 and we also

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
use a centos information system

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,760
[Applause]

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,480
the containers are very useful because

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,600
we will be

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
able to run each container for each

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
customers

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,120
so we can host the identity

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,800
for many many customers on

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,680
the same infrastructure stack

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
running containers can be a little wired

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,000
when you do it

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,560
for the first time because you need to

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
know that

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,839
a container will last all

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,360
the local data if you restart the

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
container so you need to

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,560
take care of some things when you run

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,519
your software in containers

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
of course the growth of containers is

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
also to be able to

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
have scalability so you need to think

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,040
that your containers

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,160
can be run several times to be able to

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,839
add some performance in

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,880
version im we choose a data model

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
and we choose to split the data between

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
the hoster

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
which will be the administrator and the

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,880
customer so we will have

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
a branch of the directory dedicated to

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
the customer

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,440
and branch of the directory dedicated to

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,120
all and research staff how to go

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
the first thing is to prepare your

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,480
configuration so we choose to have

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,360
an environment file for that we will

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
define

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,680
all our parameters in this file

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,200
and after we will run the image

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,480
you you see that we mount the

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,200
environment file in the container

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
and then we run the container so here is

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
a

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,480
an example on how to run the open ldap

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,480
container which is a specific image

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,279
hosted on the aw2 gitlab register

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
and we will also provide some systemd

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,880
services to easily

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,000
run these images and what you need to do

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,600
to go from the proof of concept to

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
production

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
for the proof of concept you can use the

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,399
generic images

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,640
from rw2 and from the fusion im

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
community project you want to run your

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,279
identity

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,639
service for your customers you need to

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,000
read or delegate images to put

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,720
into images your specific content and

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
you need to have your dedicated registry

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,279
this is the choice we have done with

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
vortex

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,120
we use openshift and kubernetes to run

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
the images

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,200
here are some links if you want to know

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
more about

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,800
version i am and you can access

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
the source code and of course ask some

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,519
question in the mailing list

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,000
[Applause]

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,399
of course i'll be happy to answer some

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
questions

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
goodbye

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
