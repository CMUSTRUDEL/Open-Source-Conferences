Description: 
	Speaker: Philippe Merle, INRIA
Abstract: Cloud Computing is the major trend for provisioning on-demand scalable services. However, there is a proliferation of solutions to put Cloud Computing at work. Then developers will be face to two main problems: Multi-Cloud portability and Inter-Cloud distribution. Multi-Cloud portability means how to build service-oriented applications portable on different cloud platforms. Inter-cloud distribution means how provisioning service-oriented applications distributed across different cloud platforms. This talk presents how OW2 FraSCAti could help developers to build Multi and Inter Cloud Service Oriented Applications. OW2 FraSCAti is an open source middleware platform supporting OASIS Service Component Architecture (SCA). SCA is a set of specifications to build composite service-oriented applications. OW2 FraSCAti supports a large variety of technologies to build SCA applications like Java POJO, BPEL, Spring, OSGi, BPEL, scripting languages, JNA, WSDL, SOAP, REST, JMS, Java RMI, JSON-RPC, UPnP, JGroups, etc. OW2 FraSCAti supports eight Cloud Computing platforms: Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, CloudBees, DotCloud, Google App Engine, Heroku, InstaCompute, and OpenShift from Red Hat. Then a same SCA-based application could be deployed on these eight Cloud platforms but also across them. A live demonstration available at http://frascati.ow2.org will be presented during this talk.
