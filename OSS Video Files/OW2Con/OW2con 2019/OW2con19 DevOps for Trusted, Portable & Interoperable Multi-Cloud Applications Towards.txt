Description: 
	DevOps for Trusted, Portable and Interoperable Multi-Cloud Applications Towards The Digital Single Market, DECIDE Project

DECIDE provides a new generation of multi-cloud service-based software framework, enabling techniques and mechanisms to design, develop, and dynamically deploy multi-cloud aware applications in an ecosystem of reliable, interoperable, and legal compliant cloud services.
DECIDE provides a set of architectural patterns and the needed tools to develop and operate (following the DevOps approach) multi-cloud aware applications that can be dynamically self-adapt or be re-deployed using different cloud services. Furthermore, DECIDE also sets up an ecosystem of trusted, interoperable and legally compliant cloud services (ACSmI-Advanced Cloud Service meta-Intermediator) and the required mechanisms to register, discover, compose, use and assess them.

The ARCITECT design-pattern selection tool, the OPTIMUS deployment simulation tool and the continuous deployment support tool (DECIDE ADAPT), go beyond the state-of-the-art in several ways. On one hand, they provide the most adequate deployment application topology based on a set of usersâ€™ requirements. On the other hand, they automate the provisioning and the deployment for multi-cloud applications based on the modelling of cloud resources at multiple cloud layers (IaaS, PaaS), multiple cloud nodes and of multiple cloud providers both at design-time and run-time.
Multi-cloud applications in DECIDE refer to applications that dynamically can distribute their components over heterogeneous cloud resources and still hold the functional, business and non-functional properties declared in their SLAs. Service based software deployed on multiple cloud providers require means to discover, aggregate (compose), and consume cloud services, functionalities provided by the DECIDE ACSmI (Advanced Cloud Service meta-Intermediator).
