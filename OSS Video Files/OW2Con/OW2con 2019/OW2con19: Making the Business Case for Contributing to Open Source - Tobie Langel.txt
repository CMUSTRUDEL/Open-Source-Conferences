Title: OW2con19: Making the Business Case for Contributing to Open Source - Tobie Langel
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	Today, pretty much all companies have embraced open source. But while they’re all keen to use open source, at lot fewer actually contribute to it.

And yet, there’s real value in doing so. Companies use their contribution to open source to boost recruiting (Facebook claims 75% of their new engineering recruit mention Facebook’s open source program as a key reason they accepted their offer), increase their market, build a moat around their business, or position themselves as leaders in their field.

In this talk, we’ll look at the different ways contributing to open source can benefit a business and become a competitive advantage. We’ll look at the open source strategies of different companies, big and small, and provide you with the knowledge to start building a business case for open source in your own company.

	00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:17,820
so why do companies contribute to open

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:20,250
source yes so hello everyone okay yes so

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,650
you know when you ask this question in

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,289
general the answer is you get back a

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,480
sort of like wishy-washy and feel-good

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,490
answers right it's like oh you know we

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,140
contribute back to open source because

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,230
it's for the common good because it's

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,520
the right thing to do to pay it forward

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,920
etc right and if we put those on the

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,750
scale you know all by themselves that's

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,950
really nice you know it tips the scale

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,129
towards the idea of what let's

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,280
contribute to open source um but the

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,579
problem arises as soon as other people

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,579
on the company bring back sort of like

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,590
objections they have to having folks

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,570
contribute to open source I mean you

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,879
have multiple usually have the legal

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,610
team that is upset about losing

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,090
intellectual property about increased

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,430
risk

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,200
you only have for example product being

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,850
worried about losing competitive

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,799
advantage if everything is open-source

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,530
or like you know of open sourcing

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,210
software and then you only have you know

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,130
even like engineering leader is saying

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,240
well who's gonna pay for those resources

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,759
are they going to be contributing to

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,280
open source and also we don't actually

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,729
know how to do that properly so you know

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,829
how do we do it and basically while

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,990
we're now in a position in time where we

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,290
have a really good understanding of the

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,420
return on investment of using open

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,670
source and our own products we don't

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,049
really have a good answer to what's the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,320
actual value of contributing back and

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,610
the other aspect of course is we're you

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
know we have like we don't really

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,280
understand what the risks they are well

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,200
and when we do we we usually see them in

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,759
like a very exaggerated fashion pretty

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,520
much like we're all very scared of

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,159
sharks whereas like actually dying by a

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,629
short byte is not a very frequent thing

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,280
to do so in the first part of this

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,580
presentation we're just going to talk

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
about like two

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,980
key benefits of open source first one is

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,250
strategic and the second one is what I

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,810
call second-order benefits so I'm just

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,300
gonna start with strategic give you two

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,020
quick examples of how open source is

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,330
used today by businesses to basically

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,390
improve their bottom line so one of the

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,250
strategy that's often seen is

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,560
commoditizing your complement so if you

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,080
look for example at Google

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,740
well Google's business is in search and

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,810
in order to get eyeballs well it's it's

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,300
it's basically selling ads after search

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,480
and in order to get eyeballs on that

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,760
what they have done is commoditized the

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,180
solutions that bring these eyeballs to

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,510
their product right and so both chromium

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,300
and Android are two large Google

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,290
products that help them you know help

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,270
them with their business objectives

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,810
similarly Intel's business is selling

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,340
chips software you know CPUs and it's

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,290
not surprising that there are the

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,050
biggest contributor to Linux because

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,930
that is the the compliment to to selling

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:27,040
chips is an operating system and it's

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:31,630
much better for Intel to have a free

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,760
open source operating systems then to be

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,290
completely dependent on on vendor like

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,220
for example Microsoft Red Hat

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,080
second-biggest contribute to Linux

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,030
selling services on top of it so that

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,610
makes sense do and Facebook is an

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,170
interesting one here because you know

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,000
you can look at Facebook's business

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,870
model as one round the data mining of

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,400
user habits and behavior and so it turns

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,739
out that data centers are quite

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,950
expensive and that's one of the reasons

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,300
why Facebook started the Open Compute um

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,280
what is it called Open Compute Project

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,830
yes Open Compute Project which is

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,400
basically open sourcing hardware and

00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:11,380
server designs and data centers and so

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,180
again that has helped kumano ties and

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,109
create a whole standards you know as

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,120
standardization of hardware that they

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,620
can use in their data centers and have

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,010
much cheaper because there's a lot more

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,810
competition in that space another very

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,160
common strategy

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,560
right now which is you'll see a lot of

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,450
the Elin was talking about that earlier

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,720
a lot of the cloud players actually

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,880
using that is using basically the fact

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,180
that developers when they start using

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,600
open source software for prototyping or

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,550
as part of their hobby work then tend to

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,430
bring those back into the enterprise

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,919
into their jobs and so actually having a

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,500
good a good way to unwrap developers

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,020
from open source to paid solutions and

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,030
to price solutions when they're actually

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,940
deploying in production software

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,950
solutions is also a very commonly used

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,169
strategy that's one of the reasons for

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:10,330
example that Microsoft bought github

00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:11,889
recently ready so we can now I'd like

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,860
now to look at what I call second-order

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,540
benefits of open source I don't know if

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,690
you're familiar was this diagram you've

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,169
probably seen it online it's a process

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,720
diagram where you have yeah I like it

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,330
it's funny right so you have basically

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,039
as input problem in coffee and

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,580
engineering the middle that creates a

00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,350
solution and has as a byproduct sarcasm

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,229
so if you look at that and do it for

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,510
software engineers instead well nothing

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:44,590
much changes except your solution is now

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:48,100
expressed in code what happens when that

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,440
software engineer now works in like open

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,720
source while you suddenly have this pool

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,810
of Commons right this software that's

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,450
shared by the community and you have

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,729
this the source you know that the output

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:05,380
of that the engineers work that goes

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:07,389
into that pool and soon you have a

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,210
second software engineer that

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:12,100
contributes to that pool - and what

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,990
happens next is really interesting is

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,440
you start having interactions between

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,810
these two engineers through lots of

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,720
different means right so these could be

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,360
just conversations on the mailing list

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,710
could be through pull requests reviews

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,900
mentoring and networking and events and

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,000
so on and so forth

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,240
so if you remember this by-product that

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,380
we had originally and then was sarcasm

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,430
for an individual software engineer when

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,240
these interactions

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,750
also have their own byproducts right and

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,910
there's actually a lot of them and they

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,970
go from you know adopting best practices

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,910
to improving soft skills for engineers

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,760
that are working in their you know an

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:01,480
open source environment and what's

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,790
interesting is you can actually classify

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,300
those basically in four broad categories

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,490
which are benefits for at the project

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,990
level at the individual level at the

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:18,100
team level and for corporations I don't

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,940
know how much time I have left five

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,860
minutes okay

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,900
so I'll move on quickly so I'd like to

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,710
look at two examples of those that I

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,870
find particularly interesting one is a

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,710
research by Frank Nagaland that was

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,950
released not long ago which showed that

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,470
four teams contributing to the Linux

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,970
kernel compared to teams that were not

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,700
contributing back to it

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,640
teams were actually twice as efficient

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,960
working on their own project as teams

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,090
that were just freeloading over the

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,530
project and it's not like five percent

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,960
more ten percent more it's like a

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,700
hundred percent more and there are too

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,190
many reasons to that which Frank Nangal

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,190
talks about in his research the first

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,410
one is well they just get trained by

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,450
really good engineers working on the

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,940
project on a day to day basis right if

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,080
you think about it a pull request

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,850
getting someone to review your pull

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,890
request is basically having one of the

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,200
best person in the planet on that

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,750
particular software telling you how to

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,060
improve your code freely on a

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,550
competitor's time right so it's it's

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,110
like very you know very a very effective

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,390
way and the other the other point which

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,030
is really interesting is the network

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,710
that you create when you work in in the

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,390
open source you basically create a

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,550
network that allows you to really

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,490
quickly solve problems when they show up

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,680
so you know this bug that would take you

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,600
like a whole week to figure out is maybe

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,270
just like a short email away to have a

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,370
really simple answer to if you know the

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,320
right person to talk to and that person

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,880
will actually listen

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,540
will actually consider your email

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,020
because you're part of the community

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,810
another common second-order benefit of

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,670
having a strong open-source culture

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,730
having a strong culture of contributing

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,740
to open source is of course the HR angle

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,450
rate the recruiting and retaining angle

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,810
and as an example Facebook before it was

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,690
when it was you know this really a hot

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,190
tech startup that was about to IPO and

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,490
didn't have all of them the privacy

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,800
issues that it has now you know despite

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,630
it being extremely attractive to

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,190
engineers just as it was in surveys that

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,400
were done was engineers that had

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,950
accepted a job offer there 75% of them

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,080
said that the the open source program

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,110
that Facebook had was a key reason for

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,090
them to do so so even for a hot startup

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,950
it's still something that's really

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,780
important to consider and obviously if

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,060
your company is not a hard start a hot

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:57,250
startup like yeah it's it's even more of

00:09:52,060 --> 00:10:00,730
a good example so what have we done here

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:04,420
is we've basically packed full of nice

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,700
benefits on a scale and trying to tip it

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,170
and if we really want to be able to tip

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,260
it all the way what we have to do is

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,970
have a look at those you know issues

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,080
with open source and see what we can do

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,900
to make them lighter in terms of weight

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,810
so we'll look quickly at two of them one

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,030
is the idea that we're losing a

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,520
competitive advantage so this is a very

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,220
famous Wayne Gretzky quote that's used

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,080
like over use probably in presentations

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,640
but it's really interesting it's the

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,220
idea that copying as a as a as a

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,710
business strategy is seldom a good one

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,300
and so the whole idea of actually being

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,820
worried that others are going to copy

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,510
you and not open sourcing things because

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,710
of that is generally not very founded

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,420
the second one which I think is really

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,430
interesting is the lost intellectual

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,530
property bit which is a one that I hear

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,210
a lot and there's this really

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,060
interesting quote from Leon Lacan which

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:04,240
used to be the head of AI at Facebook

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,459
and which says I quote in today's world

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,130
pase internet service deployment owning

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,529
IP has become considerably less

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,540
important than turning result research

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,080
into innovative products as quickly as

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,990
possible

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,459
and deploying them at scale and so you

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,890
know it's you're basically making a

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:23,410
trade-off between having great teams

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,360
that can innovate and keeping the IP

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,820
right and if you think about it having

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,550
great teams you actually get that by

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,080
having teams that are by having a strong

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,970
open-source culture because that's what

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,649
I track attracts talent and creates

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:42,610
innovation and so was that we're tipping

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:43,899
the you know the scale a way in the

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,770
direction of actually contributing to

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:50,110
open source and so of course every

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,760
company is gonna be different in that

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,010
regard right so what I'm trying to do

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,540
here is first of all give you a way to

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,480
think about this differently which is

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,700
tigh open source to business objectives

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,160
and and consider it as a business

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,440
trade-off and then give you sort of a

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,200
toolkit of the benefits and mitigation

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:14,050
strategies to basically be able to make

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,510
the business case internally for having

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:20,620
a stronger open-source contributing

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:23,410
culture and if you do that just a couple

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,370
of words before leaving is be reasonable

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,070
in and what you want listen to others

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,790
and aim for small wins sale first all

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:38,290
right thank you very much

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,290
