Description: 
	The enterprise email industry is dominated by American solutions such as Microsoft Exchange, O365, Domino or Gmail. This raises a number of valid questions about sovereignty. Where’s the data stored? What does the application actually do? Who has access to it? What laws are data and applications subject to? Whether you’re a user or an email service provider, there are alternatives to ensure the sovereignty of your mail platform.
BlueMind is a French complete collaborative enterprise email and unified communications solution. We offer any type of organisation the possibility to opt for a sovereign, open and competitive email solution on par with American giants. In this speech, BlueMind's founder Pierre Baudracco, will explain the journey of building such a revolution and the expected outcomes.
