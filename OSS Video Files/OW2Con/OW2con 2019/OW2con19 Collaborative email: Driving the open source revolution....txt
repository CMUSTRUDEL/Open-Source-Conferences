Title: OW2con19 Collaborative email: Driving the open source revolution...
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	The enterprise email industry is dominated by American solutions such as Microsoft Exchange, O365, Domino or Gmail. This raises a number of valid questions about sovereignty. Where’s the data stored? What does the application actually do? Who has access to it? What laws are data and applications subject to? Whether you’re a user or an email service provider, there are alternatives to ensure the sovereignty of your mail platform.
BlueMind is a French complete collaborative enterprise email and unified communications solution. We offer any type of organisation the possibility to opt for a sovereign, open and competitive email solution on par with American giants. In this speech, BlueMind's founder Pierre Baudracco, will explain the journey of building such a revolution and the expected outcomes.

after my presentation I am Dominic you

00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:25,050
in charge of the software Factory in the

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,830
mind so bloomin energy I'll start with

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,700
the presentation of blue mine the

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:36,090
solution this is a collaborative missing

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,739
gene solution and I'll talk about blue

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:47,809
mines company as well and try to make

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:52,710
you feel the issues with encountered

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:57,750
when trying to do to be successful in

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,940
the email market so blue mine is today

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,520
the first European enterprise email

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,060
publisher is our few words important

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,000
here this is enterprise Enterprise mail

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:13,710
and there is not open Scioscia actually

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,920
really we are the first try now we have

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,880
for more than 400 clients yesterday I

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,700
heard PR say we had more than 500

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,110
clients and customers in Walworth

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,950
especially in France of course from

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,650
little enterprise to two governments of

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,020
course blue in solution is open source

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,360
and we work with the network of

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,899
integrators we call them partners there

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,439
are those that will deal with final

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,030
customers we are not going to do

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,340
installations you installed your mind

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,340
and do the first level support of lumen

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,149
we are going to rely on a network of

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,829
partners that will be trained and

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,340
certified by us and this allows us to be

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,200
close to every customer because when we

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,360
have people when you meet people

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,530
interested in the mind the first thing

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,540
we do is try to get them in touch with

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,240
there is a partner that will be close to

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,209
them so that they can make a successful

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,580
project so here are a few references I

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,310
won't get into the details of course but

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,600
what's important is that there are small

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,300
accounts big accounts there are some of

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,530
them are public private we work with

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:44,390
governments for for for which securities

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:47,730
and sovereignty is a real preoccupation

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,170
so do mine has comprehensive features I

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,440
won't get into the details right now but

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,790
when you think about email well that's

00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:00,600
only part of the story when we talk

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,390
about collaborative solution there's

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,130
much more than this the emails of course

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,800
but everything you need to collaborate

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,720
with people in real time or not I mean

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:16,830
there's a bridge with voice on IP there

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,290
are tools for the users whatever devices

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,519
they use and there are tools for the

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,610
administrators as well so I'll start

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,579
with this one we are open source but

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,420
that's not enough we bloom and is built

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:37,620
with on API so that means that we don't

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,950
know how software is going to be used in

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,549
the future with which other solutions is

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:48,780
going to work so blue man is API first

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:52,440
it means that any partner or customer

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,709
can even imagine new ways to to to

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,859
integrate domain with their own

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,230
infrastructure

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,840
so it's user centric cost-efficient and

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,040
at the heart we there is a sovereignty

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,500
means that people who use blue mine will

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,600
know what is done with their data

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,280
because all software is open-source and

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,470
where the data is so a software

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,450
publishers there is very simple

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,760
relationships between relationship

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,590
between blue mine the company and room

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,289
and the software this gives

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:31,870
we are 100% invested in doing blue mind

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:34,479
solution so we can build we've been

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,000
building technological expertise for a

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,419
long time we have a vision and we are

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,370
going to all this vision we well this is

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,759
of course a long-term commitment well

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,130
and we are working hard to build a

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,680
strong ecosystem around us the next time

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,349
will be about that so I've talked about

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,319
Blue Man and partner our partner Network

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:59,530
and we've been we've built a lot of

00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,630
tools for this partner and I could work

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,699
with a lot of tools to to to enable

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:11,319
partners or customers to to be able to

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:15,669
to install to use to document blue mind

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:22,780
to to bring blue mind as a credible

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:24,699
solution to other messaging solutions so

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:29,770
we've built a marketplace I've thought

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:33,610
about the api's we can anyone can

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,050
contribute and write an add-on to

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,180
Bluemont you to bring new

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,880
functionalities and publish it to the

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,469
marketplace we are administrating the

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,509
marketplace but it is open for all

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,789
partners and for all the ecosystem there

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,880
are tools for everyone there are tools

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:54,340
for a very specific niche there's room

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,770
for everyone on this marketplace and of

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,020
course we are very active on the in the

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,750
community so you know about the previous

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,900
opens awesome it also live as an

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,300
association of companies so for its free

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,430
open source companies you know about the

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,009
CNL player boricua is of course very

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,340
active on all of those as there is o W

00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,159
to thank you for doing what you're doing

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,530
it's been a great pleasure to be here

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:22,810
and last week we've organized the first

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,930
blue mind submit and we haven't

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,050
completely recovered yet so sorry about

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:32,560
my voice too and you see Kara

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,389
is a bit tied to we it's been a success

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,319
it was the first time we were organizing

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,960
our first event gathering partners

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,490
customers and it's been really a

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:51,220
pleasure to meet in person all of these

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:55,000
structures so I won't try to convince

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,870
you that email is the number one tool

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,370
for collaboration there are figures this

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:08,349
is a no we haven't made those we email

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:14,110
is a real need for for any any company

00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:17,409
in the university any public account

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:23,710
whatever you need email to to to work on

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:27,810
the day to day basis so the problem is

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:32,130
for email but for a lot of other markets

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,960
most of the solutions are American and

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,029
this is a problem I won't get into the

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,169
details why this is problem but this is

00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:43,659
globally acknowledged as a problem so

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:47,050
people are beginning to to realize it

00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:49,630
and they are starting to take actions on

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,990
the French level on on the European

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,330
level so we'll see what how it goes but

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,860
this is a good time to promote local

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,599
initiatives and local companies and of

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:08,889
course open source is a real weapon to

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:14,639
to to fight against the big companies so

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:18,490
I'm going to go back to the email market

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,979
so when you have an email project you

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,090
you meet a new customer as a road to

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:28,360
success there's a door and on this door

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,099
there's a lock if you've worked on email

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,760
projects you know what I'm talking about

00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:36,550
if your only email user you certainly

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,300
know well this logo this is outlook for

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,710
a lot of users for most users actually

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,670
their outlook is a senior name

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,590
females this is the tools they are using

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,330
every day they're using it for male of

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,330
God but for much much more than this

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:56,590
this is number one tool this is arguably

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,660
the most functional you you can do

00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,170
everything on it people are spending the

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,350
days only working with it

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:09,490
so we've acknowledged this and we've

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,370
worked out on Blumenthal's is the most

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:19,120
recent release of blue mine and we've

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:22,060
acknowledged that users need the love's

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,520
in need outlook maybe not all users but

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:29,560
for every project there are more or less

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,770
important part of the user base we

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,610
really depend on outlook so they love it

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,010
and if you try to chew to tell them okay

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,630
this is another tool you will be able to

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,500
do everything you are currently doing

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:49,720
with Outlook well they will find the

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:53,440
habits completely scattered of two three

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,900
four different applications of course of

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,170
course functionally you guys

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,170
functionality-wise

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:03,940
everything will be here but this won't

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:08,170
work this will be a deal-breaker so I'm

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,420
going to have a look how technically the

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,370
helpless outlook and exchange tacky is

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,150
organized I'm not going to get into the

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:20,170
details details but here it is you see

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:23,980
there is standards on the left there is

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:27,070
the RF RFC SMTP and once you get into

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,490
the exchange and outlook stack if you

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,310
know about email you see no no no no no

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,270
this will be familiar because all of

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:40,300
this is proprietary proprietary stack

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:44,470
Microsoft proprietary stack so and it

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:47,380
doesn't look like email at all even in

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:52,540
the core how the data is taught it's

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,270
stored in may PI stores it sits

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,050
Keva key-value store it's not it doesn't

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:03,180
look like email at all and there are

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:06,460
exchange services an active directory

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,890
and they are the exchange protocols

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,020
which are used to talk with Outlook so

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,480
Outlook doesn't know about standards of

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,560
course people we tell you outlook can be

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,080
used I as in my map client for it for

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,570
instance but it doesn't work well at all

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,770
and this is only made everything that is

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:31,080
collaborative in Outlook doesn't work if

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:34,450
you don't have the same IP protocol so

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,500
we've acknowledged this and we've tried

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,540
and we've succeeded in implementing our

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,210
implementing the protocols it started

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,370
with changing how we are storing the

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:51,250
data at the core of blue mind and you

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:53,860
see all of this is publicly described

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,500
the specifications because the European

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,110
Commission has worked out to force

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,920
Microsoft Microsoft you open the

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,410
specification but it's full of traps and

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,930
hidden data and it's really really

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,460
complex see for instance one document is

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:15,970
about no messages properties it's almost

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:20,260
400 pages and it's only one document out

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,140
of more than 100 for every of those

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,910
properties

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,120
many properties are binaries it means

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,990
there are strings of 0 and once and it's

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,160
we we've had a really hard time figuring

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,620
out what all of this means you see and

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,960
very often - there are hidden messages

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,070
it means that to understand what's going

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,470
on between exchange an exchange server

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,800
and Outlook we have to see what's going

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,990
on the wire so it's been we've been

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,840
we've had a real hard time and a lot of

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,240
companies have tried to do this we've

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,070
been working on this for five years and

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,629
there was a journal effect we couldn't

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,040
talk about it

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:08,389
of course we couldn't see anything

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,550
working because we we had to have at

00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,499
least a good curvature of the

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:17,929
functionality before outlook would only

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:22,040
start to accept to start so and now now

00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:25,129
we are done blooming for zero is out and

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,470
now it is about to talk with bloom and

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:32,660
server just as if it was an exchange

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:36,290
server so your VIP is happy and you can

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,709
do your email project and you can bring

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:42,529
change and you can give the company the

00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:47,720
choice to use something else than

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:50,869
exchange so blue man is now the only one

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:56,749
well outlook a compatible connector free

00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:59,600
solution I mean that in remind we are

00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:02,749
not using connectors which is we've used

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,449
to to do this it means that we are using

00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:07,189
outlook as an IMAP client and we were

00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:10,040
adding some functionalities with

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:11,809
connectors this is what Zimbra does for

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,110
instance a lot of competitors do this

00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,179
but it doesn't work well because it it

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,540
does not make use of the native Outlook

00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:23,389
functions so we've implemented made in

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,449
layers well and it can talk it to a book

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:31,749
so now the choice is here and by choice

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:35,600
we mean we don't encourage people to use

00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:39,769
Outlook of course but we are giving them

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,139
the choice to once blue- insult you use

00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:45,139
anything they like and maybe discover

00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,759
that alternative is good and that in the

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,559
ecosystem they'll find something that

00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,980
will suit them just as well as outlook

00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:57,380
in the long term but we've opened the

00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:01,820
door to to to email thank you very much

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,820
