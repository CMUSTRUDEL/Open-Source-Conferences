Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	GLPI is an asset management solution developed by Teclib, with a flexible plugins system that allows powerful extensions and easy customization. GLPI manage large assets of desktops and servers and can also manage fleets of mobiles using the Flyve Mobile Device Management solution that is based on GLPI.
We will present recent and future developments of GLPI, targeting automation capabilities, Cybersecurity management and green IT functionalities.
Automating management is a must-have for large IT systems; GLPI now supports full automation through integration of Ansible, the major open source solution for IT automation. Integration allows to use GLPI as an Ansible inventory source or to run playbooks within GLPI.
When talking about Cybersecurity, inventory of assets is the first task that lies with IT security management. Future developments of GLPI will allow to integrate automatic discovery of vulnerabilities and tracking of identified vulnerabilities of an Information System.
Finally, as global climate change warnings raise everyday, controlling the power consumption of IT assets becomes unavoidable. GLPI will include in a future version a set of plugins for power management, allowing to apply in a centralized way power management policies in order to reduce significantly the power consumption of an Information System.
