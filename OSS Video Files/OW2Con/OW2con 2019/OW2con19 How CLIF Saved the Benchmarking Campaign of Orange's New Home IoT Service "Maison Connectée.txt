Description: 
	In April 2019, Orange opened their new Home IoT service "Maison Connectée". Orange subscribers with a compatible Livebox just have to download the application and buy some DECT-ULE connected devices. Then, possibly almost 3 millions homes may open a permanent network connection to the service platform, which is a technical challenge... also for the benchmarking campaign!
We found that CLIF was the only performance testing software able to massively generate network connections and traffic, thanks to its distributed traffic generation support and its ability to run an arbitrary number of virtual users on each traffic generator.
This talk will show how we used and contributed to CLIF to support up to 60 thousands simultaneous MQTT connections per traffic generator, with one virtual user emulating the traffic of a Livebox with its associated connected devices. We also explain how we used the same CLIF scenarios to perform integration tests and live Quality of Experience monitoring.
