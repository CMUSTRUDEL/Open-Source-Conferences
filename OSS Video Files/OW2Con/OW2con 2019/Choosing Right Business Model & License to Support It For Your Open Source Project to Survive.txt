Title: Choosing Right Business Model & License to Support It For Your Open Source Project to Survive
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	An open source project is really no different from any other when it comes to business models. There are no "open source business models" but there are business models that work better for open source projects, and selecting the right kind of license is one of the key elements to supporting the business model you have in mind for your project. We will examine types of business models and open source licenses and how to chose them based on the product you are developing.

all right so I have 15 minutes to talk

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,960
about a subject for which I take usually

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,139
an hour and a half so I'm gonna make a

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,080
summary and I'm going to talk about two

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,449
aspects of open source business models

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,430
that work for open source and I'm really

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,920
careful to not say open source business

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,590
models there's no such thing a business

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,449
model is a business model and I'm going

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,130
to talk about choosing a license for

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,170
open source and elements that can help

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,920
you choose a license as a developer it's

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,790
an overview okay as a brief introduction

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,469
to who I am I we pros key customers

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,450
globally on their open source strategy

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,090
from a very high-level strategy

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,670
integration into HR talent acquisition

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,809
retention innovation marketing aspects

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,699
and things like that so I'm not a

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,739
technical person I used to be but not

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,780
anymore if you want to talk about

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,520
quantum cryptography I can because

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,960
that's my background but afterwards so

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,150
talking about open source and and

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,189
imagining a business model for a project

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,600
if you're a startup or if you're trying

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,939
to sell a product that's built on open

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,030
source you want to to consider a few

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,720
aspects that that have an impact on on

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,479
how you're you're going to make money or

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,299
at least some return on your own your

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,130
open source investment I'm going to talk

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,990
about a few examples of such business

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,520
models in the following slides if I'm

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,650
going to go fast

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,450
if you if you want my emails is on the

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,729
last slide send an email and I'll send

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,290
you the deck with the details unless

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,350
they're shared on the website they're

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,110
shared ok so so there's there's four

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,570
basic ways to consider open source

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,820
inside your product first of all you're

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,460
building open source if you create a

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,320
project or a product and that is

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,299
actually open source that's a great way

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,729
okay and you have to find ways to

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,040
monetize the fact that your product

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,570
itself is open source open source means

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,670
and we'll see that in the licenses that

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,290
it can be freely redistributed so

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,060
usually you're not going to be selling

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,439
the product itself because everybody

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,560
else can redistribute it so you wouldn't

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,480
sell it to too many people another

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,670
aspect of using open source inside the

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,830
develop in the project

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,260
building with open-source you build your

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,239
project around or using open-source

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,739
technologies and depending on the

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,510
licenses of these technologies your

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,780
product itself can be fully open source

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,150
or can be closed source with open source

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,800
components a Mac OS for example is not

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,380
really open source but it uses a lot of

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,970
open source components another one is

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,670
building for open source your designing

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,650
services or products that help the open

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,480
source developers community users

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,519
whatever that's another way to to

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,519
integrate open source into your your own

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,840
products and finally it's building your

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:53,209
business on open source for example we

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,830
Pro we're a system integrator one of our

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,720
activities is is supporting our

00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,890
customers on their open-source strategy

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,450
and activities we're building our

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:04,430
business on open source okay so with

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,280
these models in mind I'm going to look

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,900
at a few examples of of companies that

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,060
have implemented business models that

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,150
work really well with open source okay

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,040
so a first example is Amazon and by the

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,450
way everybody loves to hate Amazon when

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,489
it comes to open source because they

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,450
just take everything make money off of

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,609
them and they're not the best

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,920
contributor on the planet nevertheless

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:27,200
it's an exact it's a it's a really good

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,820
business model they are leveraging a

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,870
whole bunch of open source stuff and

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,130
they're selling services based on these

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,810
products so they're making these

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,880
products available as a service which is

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,400
okay because a lot of people don't want

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,290
to run a data center in their in their

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
office so there's there's a real

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,859
business case for for selling stuff as a

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,989
service okay

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,700
Netflix is also doing that but they're

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,760
not selling the service itself they're

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:58,269
selling videos who here does not use

00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:01,100
Netflix good ok try it no seriously

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,170
Netflix is an example they've actually

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,209
used a lot of open source in their in

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,040
their services and they've contributed

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,540
they're a big big big contributor to

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,609
open source they've made real

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,609
performance important improvements they

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,290
worked on an optimizing data center

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:19,729
applications are really good guys on the

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:22,490
opposite of Amazon ok another example is

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:25,340
is a service revenue for technical

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,290
support so that's where you have a

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,760
product it's based on open source

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,140
it might be your product it might be as

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,970
somebody else's product but you're going

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,340
to sell support some products have

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,720
community support and a lot of people

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,800
come to me and say oh we're gonna work

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,330
with a community who's important

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
community and we're gonna ask the

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,380
community for support that doesn't work

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,630
really well they tend to not respond

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,190
nicely if they respond at all they have

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,990
no SLA s and they have no

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,140
confidentiality clause so you can't send

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,790
documents or files to a community but

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,680
you can work with a third party company

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,390
so here there's an example a few

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,010
examples here with rogue wave or some

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,260
other system integrators can do that

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:05,990
which we do okay so selling support is a

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:07,820
good business model the another option

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,350
is to actually reuse the cost of your

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,300
product so that's not exactly selling

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,770
the open source part or making money

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,840
from open source but it's reducing the

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,730
cost of your product by embedding open

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,170
source components in them and this can

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,880
be really tricky if you want me to tell

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,590
you a horror story about Linksys and

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,090
open source come to me after it's

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,100
because it doesn't fit in the length of

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,710
this session but but it can have a

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,150
really really strong impact on your

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,860
whole business strategy if you mess up

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,170
your licensing when you embed open

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,280
source components so be careful but it

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,170
works well if you do it well okay you

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,420
can also create a business model based

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,550
on redistributing rights redistribution

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,640
rights of your open source product and

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,550
as an example here is the MongoDB

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,410
company and product where they have a

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,130
community version of the product but

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,690
they have a commercially licensed

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,960
version of the product so it's often

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,530
call also a dual licensing model and and

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,850
MongoDB has created a very tough

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,650
community license so that it's very hard

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,380
to reuse the community version of

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,650
MongoDB on an extranet or on on a camera

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,530
on a commercially externally exposed

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,790
website because your whole site and

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,040
infrastructure has to turn into

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,080
open-source so I know companies who have

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,550
a ban on using MongoDB Community Edition

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,800
internally because they're afraid their

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,120
employees will by mistake make it

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,770
available outside and then it would have

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,900
to turn everything open source so

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,270
MongoDB also sells a commercial version

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,130
of it which allows you to take your

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,020
internal developments put it on the

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,850
outside without having to open source

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,370
all the code but you have to pay for a

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,090
MongoDB commercial version so it's it's

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,070
an interesting

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,720
business model it works well MongoDB has

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,020
made a lot of enemies by creating a new

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,480
license the server-side public license

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,130
which they they try to submit your OS I

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,230
for approval as an open-source license

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,360
didn't go well so now they're just using

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,840
their SS PL license and are not calling

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,820
yet open-source anymore but it has most

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,420
of the open-source elements in there and

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,480
it's a long debate so not for here

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,610
another example is is offering enhanced

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,470
commercial upgrades to open source

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,390
software which is you have a piece of

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,490
open source software that offers a

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,350
certain amount of functionality and that

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,560
is available as a community version and

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,890
you sell add-ons to it that offer

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,750
enhanced features it's it's also called

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,480
a freemium model where you have a the

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,710
free open model and then you have things

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,510
that you need to buy if you want to do

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,420
anything useful with it and that's the

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,070
tricky part how much where do you put

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,140
the limit between what is available for

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,390
free and what you have to pay for in

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,460
order to do something useful if you have

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,770
to pay to do any kind of useful stuff

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,560
the community gets really upset and it

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,730
just does not play in your favor so you

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,470
want to make sure that the community

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,350
version is usable enough has enough

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,170
features to be attractive useful and

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,300
that only for a specific users you get

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,410
the extensions if not you upset people

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,780
and you don't want to have upset

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,300
customers so if you look at MySQL for

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,010
example in order to use MySQL anywhere

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,570
in production in enterprise you really

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,350
need to get the Enterprise Edition so

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,360
people are going to mariadb Postgres and

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,040
starting to look away from mysql bad

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,940
choice

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,850
ouch okay four minutes okay so other

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,100
examples subscription models like Red

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,660
Hat where you pay regularly and you're

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,450
allowed to get updates and support and

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,270
things like that and the last one I want

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,160
to put here is not making money from the

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,690
open source but actually leveraging your

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,920
presence in the open source space to

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,050
sell the rest of your products because

00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,970
you're the best and those are examples

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:45,620
like Microsoft is doing really well in

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,760
the space right now ok let's talk in the

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,560
last few minutes about open source

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,090
license this is a critical element and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,060
I'm going to give you a few elements to

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,710
choose but first I want you to realize

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,590
that open source is defined

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,410
as freedom freedom to tinker get the

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,210
source code modify redistribute etc but

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,850
if you look at the definition of what is

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,730
an actual open-source license it's

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,770
actually not only about freedoms and

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,170
permissions but it's about obligations

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,390
when you choose an open-source license

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,460
for your project if somebody is going to

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,280
reuse your project in their development

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,630
they have obligations they must allow

00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,640
the right word

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,240
they must allow integrity of the source

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,320
code they cannot redistribute

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,120
discriminate against you so you cannot

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,280
have a license that says you cannot use

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,700
this for developing weapons certain cut

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,170
burns was that one you cannot limit your

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,420
license to a product a general

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,130
open-source license must be generic can

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,990
be used for any product there is a

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,000
definition for this any license that

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,220
fits this definition can be called an

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,810
open-source license any license that is

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,000
called open-source must fit this

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,470
definition don't invent a new license

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,280
for the project pick one that's an

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,660
Aussie approved license it's much easier

00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,850
there are three categories of license as

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,800
going to be my last slide and you will

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,230
pick your license based on what you want

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,430
your your developers to be able to do

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,620
with your code and how do you want them

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,810
to integrate a major code the first

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,600
category is called the non copy EFT or

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,760
the weak copy left or the non-reciprocal

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,570
licenses sorry not weak non copy left or

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,100
non-reciprocal

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,630
their license is where you can basically

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,120
do whatever you want with the proper

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,040
with your your software and you don't

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,630
have to make your corresponding software

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,270
open-source or you don't even have to

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,340
contribute back the BSD license is like

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,200
that and it encourages people to do so

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,460
because of a community feeling because

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,530
you think it's the right thing but it

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,350
doesn't force anybody then you have the

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,480
weak copy your left licenses which say

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,670
if you modify anything in my software

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,590
that modification has to be contributed

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,330
back to the community but if you add

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,760
anything whatever you add can be

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,220
commercial closed source or whatever can

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,450
be open source as well but you can add

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,160
commercial stuff and that's interesting

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,710
if you want people to be able to embed

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,150
your stuff into commercial applications

00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,880
without having to give away all of their

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,100
hardware as a source or their software

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,570
source code so for example integration

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,400
into printer where the PostScript

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,200
interpreter would be proprietary you

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,720
would want the OS to be was one of these

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,060
licenses or not

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,610
a strong cop left then the last category

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,670
is called the strong copyleft licenses

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,160
or the project level copy reciprocal

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,470
licenses they have an impact on

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,210
everything you add to the project so if

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,790
you take my source code and you modify a

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,530
line because you fix a bug you have to

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,150
contribute that back but more

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,580
importantly if you add anything to my

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,990
project including your project that has

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,030
to be contributed to the community it

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,920
was a similar type or compatible license

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,290
and that is interesting if you want to

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,270
grow your project but it's very

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,130
constraining for people who actually

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,590
want to use your stuff inside commercial

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,320
products and there their solutions their

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,600
licenses that bridge like the LGPL allow

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,670
integration in some ways but it's a very

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,340
tricky license it's often called viral

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,670
because it contaminates whatever you add

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,530
to your code so that's one of the the

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,180
nasty names for these licenses but

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,610
they're very interesting if you want

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,100
your community to actually grow your

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,250
codebase so when you pick an open-source

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,800
license really think about how you want

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,410
your community your users the people who

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,240
use your code to actually have an

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,920
obligation or not to contribute back to

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,150
your code that is what you use to choose

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,680
your license okay the one of the fun non

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,880
copyleft licenses that I like is called

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,230
the do what the you want with it

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,960
license look it up it really exists

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:35,629
thank you

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,629
