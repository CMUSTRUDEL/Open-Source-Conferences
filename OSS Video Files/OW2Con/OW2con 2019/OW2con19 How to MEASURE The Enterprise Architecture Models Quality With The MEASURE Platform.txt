Description: 
	How to MEASURE The Enterprise Architecture Models Quality With The MEASURE Platform, The H2020 Databio Project Success Story

Softeam is specialized in modelling technologies through its modelling software “Modelio”. It includes methods and languages of designing software, systems and enterprise architecture according to well-known standards such as UML, BPMN, ArchiMate, etc. Softeam has been working on providing ArchiMate models for the DataBio project that can help understanding, communicating and collaborating between the partners.  
The DataBio ArchiMate models cover the agriculture, forestry, fishery pilots and the technologies included in this project. The works on these models has started since the beginning of the project and the generated diagrams have been included in most of the deliverables.  
Due to the importance of having these kinds of models for understanding the architecture of such big project, Softeam has been working on developing “ArchiMate Metrics” that guarantee good quality for the models. For this end, Softeam is using a “Measure Platform” to monitor all “ArchiMate” Modelio repositories used by all models contributors. “Measure Platform” was developed during the “Measure” project (http://measure.softeam-rd.eu/) and is basically a web app used for collecting measures and monitoring the quality of projects.  
The presentation will show how Archimate MEASURE metrics applied have been applied to Databio pilots as new metrics within the ITEA 3 project MEASURE platform. Through the newly developed metrics it is possible to analyze ArchiMate models in order to evaluate the value of the business architectures through time with MEASURE visualization dashboards. Future work will also be presented on new ideas on possible metrics based on ArchiMate models in order to obtain possible predictive analysis (e.g. too many isolated elements and elements of not high importance could lead to a model with inferior enterprise architecture value).
A set of pre-defined complex measures to select from when creating a measure instance are already available open source on GitHub at https://github.com/ITEA3-Measure/Measures/tree/master/predefined-archimate-metrics

so hello everybody this talk is also

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,710
about a project that deals with

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,840
measurement and in this case we will

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,269
talk about what we did to measure our

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,939
model your models data are relating to

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,369
our Chi meters so to enterprisers

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,399
detector which is a bit different to

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,329
what we have seen before we are dealing

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,550
with models that have been produced by a

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:41,160
lighthouse project in big data that is

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,809
data bio it is a very big project with

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,809
49 partners and 27 pilots so many many

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,870
data in many many models and in this

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,210
project saw him at the responsibility to

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,670
to bestir the arkyd business

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,180
architecture enterprise architectures of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,190
all this final we model the pilot the

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,049
motivator showing you the strategic view

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,020
the business process the lifecycle view

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,229
and we aim with this talk to show you

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,930
that we were able to develop interesting

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,320
matrix to understand the value of these

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,960
models so in here you see a little

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,460
example of what can be an enterprise

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,259
architecture model these are schema we

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,290
will not go through that but each show

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,750
have one of the fishery pilots and the

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,150
life cycle view of this pilot

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,329
there are many component that can be

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,030
shown and also all all the steps of

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,000
these but actually when we have so many

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,070
models how can we evaluate the quality

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,710
of these models how can we see if they

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,750
are complete very readable if they are

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,939
understandable if there are complex if

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,820
there is cohesion between all these

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,310
steps basically we use a project that we

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,729
presented last year also that is the

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,369
module project and we use this platform

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:04,409
to evaluate these models so measure is a

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,689
centralized platform that the provide

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,700
dashboard and that has been developing

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,280
in the contest of our idea tree project

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,660
the so we've a consortium that made

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,750
together France

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,760
Romania Turkey and the Netherlands and

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,720
actually ended yesterday we had our

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,260
final review and with this project we

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,750
can build this specific dashboard for

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,150
basically any specific needs and we can

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,990
continuously monitor in collect measure

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,680
and we can have - for with the KPI in

00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,300
this case we you can see in there it

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,700
does not be released the press release

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,980
but we will have this measured platform

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,020
that orga where all these services will

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,470
be available and we will deliver the

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,060
press release about that next week and

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,060
basically we've measure we we are

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,320
capable to solve all the lifecycle of a

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,560
measure and to use a measurement tool to

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,140
measure all different type of matrix so

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,380
in this specific case we measure the

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,870
matters related to ultimate models to do

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,450
that we use a specific measurement tool

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,930
that is linked to the measures platform

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,200
and that is called okat being developed

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,050
within another european project that

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,720
ended in 2015 that was called mundo and

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,990
it was developed by the University of

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,030
York the University of Austin and with

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,430
this project we give a little help to

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,400
make it a measurement tool in the

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,000
measure platform you can see that truth

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,980
is this tool we are able to calculate

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,660
information about models and in

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,209
particular with these metrics that you

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,420
see in here we can see the proportion of

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,459
the very summit layers that are in the

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,440
model you project so we can see how many

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,690
elements are for strategy or many

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,870
elemental for application for business

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,690
or for technology another interesting

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,940
things that we can measure for these are

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,940
Shumate models is for example the

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,000
percentage of unused elements that can

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,310
give us an idea of the quality of the

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,870
model so if there are many empty diagram

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,900
if there are many duplicate elements

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,020
these kind of things can be monitored

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,239
and evaluated with the measure platform

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,550
associated with the right measurement

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,800
tool that in this case is evaluating

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,259
models

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,400
and in here you see five of the various

00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,099
models that we have with the data

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,099
bioproject so for agriculture fishery

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:39,620
forestry technology and the new

00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:43,970
technology so in here we see the

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,009
different value for the percentage of

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,690
duplicate elements that can give to the

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,060
project manager and to the project

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,909
leaders an idea on how to improve the

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,280
models and where effort should be taken

00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:57,440
to improve them and here you see for

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,330
example something more much more easier

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,610
so the s-1 activity can be also

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,099
monitored in here we can see the number

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,289
of commits per week and the number of

00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:09,110
contributors that can be helpful in also

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,969
many other case not only model and in

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,120
here you see the number of ultimate

00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:16,250
concept and the new elements and

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,440
relationship between elements that can

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,050
give us another element to evaluate the

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,699
quality of this kind of model than the

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,289
number of diagram and the documentation

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,020
side so what what we can give as a

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,990
suggestion after these studies we can

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,270
just have some recommendation on what it

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,669
can be the best practice to develop

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,130
these kind of models so for example we

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,830
would like to have diagrams that are not

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,289
too crowded but also not too empty so we

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,020
recommend we recommend them a value

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,520
between five and ten and twenty and also

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,430
we recommend a certain number of

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,770
relationship per diagram so that I was

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,659
not too congested and not low connected

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,319
so I recommend that is between one and

00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:02,300
four so in here you can see one

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
important point that we discovered

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,520
during the data bio project is the

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,340
understandability and in here we see how

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,529
much the model is documented that is

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,389
valid not only for our she made models

00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:17,419
but it can be also for any other type of

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,669
model women model of course the the

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,310
documentation always helps and in here

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:24,289
anyway we follow this approach we just

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,620
check the number of words which was

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,150
quite nice idea of one of our colleagues

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,110
case that is not here with us today

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:35,060
because is the data B of meeting and

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,849
actually we don't only check if there is

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,069
a comment but also how long is it

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,080
that doesn't go inside the semantics of

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,599
the comments but of course if we have a

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,139
comments of three words it doesn't say

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,330
maybe too much and in here you see a

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,429
matrix that we found in literature there

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,919
are not many matrix in literature for

00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:57,429
our schmidt actually we only found that

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,919
one and we implemented that it is about

00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:03,409
this important score that we can have

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,050
under low median score indication this

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:08,419
one gave us an matrix if there are many

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,490
empty diagram of if there are low

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,830
connection equation between the diagrams

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,749
and we did that for all the models that

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:20,209
we had in data bio so for the conclusion

00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:22,939
what this approach could provide to us

00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:25,009
actually we were able to have much more

00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:28,159
requirement elicitation the

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:31,309
compressibility of the world work was

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,110
much more easier and we are fast

00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,819
production of documentation because of

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,979
course from the models we could product

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,289
produce directly all the required

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:42,050
document and in this case deliverables

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:45,319
and actually the ultimate model were

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,559
monitored and allow us to maintain them

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:52,219
in good quality and to get feedback fast

00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:54,169
and what we decided for the future we

00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:56,599
decided that a nice interesting role to

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,119
introduce in this modern life cycle

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,449
would be to have a modeling manager that

00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:04,249
could follow up this Convention and

00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,949
guidelines and maybe in the future also

00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:11,300
some alerts could be interesting so that

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,990
is all I try to stay in the point thank

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,039
you

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,039
