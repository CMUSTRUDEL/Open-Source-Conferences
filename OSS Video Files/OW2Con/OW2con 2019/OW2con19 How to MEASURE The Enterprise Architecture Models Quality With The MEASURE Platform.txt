Description: 
	How to MEASURE The Enterprise Architecture Models Quality With The MEASURE Platform, The H2020 Databio Project Success Story

Softeam is specialized in modelling technologies through its modelling software “Modelio”. It includes methods and languages of designing software, systems and enterprise architecture according to well-known standards such as UML, BPMN, ArchiMate, etc. Softeam has been working on providing ArchiMate models for the DataBio project that can help understanding, communicating and collaborating between the partners.  
The DataBio ArchiMate models cover the agriculture, forestry, fishery pilots and the technologies included in this project. The works on these models has started since the beginning of the project and the generated diagrams have been included in most of the deliverables.  
Due to the importance of having these kinds of models for understanding the architecture of such big project, Softeam has been working on developing “ArchiMate Metrics” that guarantee good quality for the models. For this end, Softeam is using a “Measure Platform” to monitor all “ArchiMate” Modelio repositories used by all models contributors. “Measure Platform” was developed during the “Measure” project (http://measure.softeam-rd.eu/) and is basically a web app used for collecting measures and monitoring the quality of projects.  
The presentation will show how Archimate MEASURE metrics applied have been applied to Databio pilots as new metrics within the ITEA 3 project MEASURE platform. Through the newly developed metrics it is possible to analyze ArchiMate models in order to evaluate the value of the business architectures through time with MEASURE visualization dashboards. Future work will also be presented on new ideas on possible metrics based on ArchiMate models in order to obtain possible predictive analysis (e.g. too many isolated elements and elements of not high importance could lead to a model with inferior enterprise architecture value).
A set of pre-defined complex measures to select from when creating a measure instance are already available open source on GitHub at https://github.com/ITEA3-Measure/Measures/tree/master/predefined-archimate-metrics
