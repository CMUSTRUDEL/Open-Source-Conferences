Title: OW2con19: The end of Open Source? Ludovic Dubost

Description: 
	What's going on between VC Backed Open Source companies & Cloud providers ?

In this last year, we have seen an ongoing debate and flame wars about new Open Source licences, with Open Source VC backed companies changing their licences (Redis, MongoDB) and sometimes technical and business approach (Elastic Search) in a quite directed attack against large Cloud providers (AWS).
On one side, Open Source Companies state that their effort is being taken by the big cloud providers without giving back to the community. On the other side, the cloud providers and other actors are claiming the new approaches of the Open Source companies are not fully Open Source.
What's going on ?
What are the facts being the FUD of either side ?
What is at stake in this debate ?
Is this the end of Open Source and Free Software ?
What does this mean for launching new Open Source and Free Software businesses ?
Does this change how Open Source users and contributors should behave ?
If VC backed funding is not possible any more for "pure open source" are there alternatives ?
This presentation will show the view of an Open Source small business entrepreneur building an Open Source business for the last 15 years.

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,700
so the presentation is about what's

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,269
going on between vc-backed open source

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,880
companies and cloud providers so I'll

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,699
try so I'm sorry

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,100
no images it's mostly text and but it

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,390
points I know we shouldn't do that but

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,119
this is more about ideas and my personal

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,669
views of of what's going on and what

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,430
could happen so Who am I am the creator

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,770
of weeks wiki I'm running XP SS I'm

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,750
working on collaboration software for 15

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,640
years we're doing the X wiki encrypted

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,399
software I've been an open source

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,070
promoter and contributor now for 15

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,379
years and working full time of a non

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,629
open source and I'm also trying to

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,000
contribute I'm happy they was talked

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,160
about open food facts before I'm a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,940
member of the board and it's a great

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,680
project look at it and so what I what

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,830
there's a few things that happened

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,100
actually so in February 2018 kind of

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,869
silently it was not really seen

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,130
elasticsearch has changed there has

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,049
introduced the new license and

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,689
introduced code of what they were

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,700
bundling separately what they call the

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,369
expect they actually moved it to their

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,610
own to the OSS repository so to the

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,579
modules that were only open source code

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,970
before and and from then on and an on a

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,950
shared source license so not on a nosy

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,990
compatible license but on one where you

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,780
can see the code but you're not allowed

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,150
to modify it and you're not allowed to

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,770
to take it and you have to follow their

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,630
commercial offerings basically in this

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,579
area was quite silent and it was

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,340
presented in a way like oh we're making

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,640
more open when when you look back it's

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,670
very misleading and and a bit

00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,149
problematic in August 2008 Redis has

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,060
created a new license in December 2008

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,189
18 concurrent and has also created a new

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,439
license actually in February 2009 teen

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,569
Redis changed their new license to

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,720
slightly another one and so and these

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,650
license have not been validated by OSI

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,230
if I'm if

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,870
correct and actually in March 2019

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,510
Amazon announced an open D straw for

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,099
elasticsearch pointing out what it a

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,870
stake structure done and kind of saying

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,060
look we're going to make a new version a

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,150
new distribution of elasticsearch that's

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,829
actually open and in April 2009 teen

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,049
Google Cloud has announced some

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,810
partnerships with OSS company actually

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,269
the what we can see in all these things

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,930
that they were all linked in some way or

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:45,480
another to Amazon Web Services so kind

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,040
of uh these are the bad guys so even

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,530
when Google is doing this this

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,000
partnership for with open source company

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:57,120
it's a way to differentiate themselves

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,099
from Amazon Web Services and so if we

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,750
look at if we try to analyze a little

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,079
bit what has happened is what did

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,810
creators and VC's what did they hope for

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,609
so launched an open source project we

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,629
don't know whatever happened and it will

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,790
make money profit and what actually what

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,780
they wanted so they start an open source

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,760
project alone with friends with help of

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,150
a company then the community loves the

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,669
project and they're using it a lot the

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,040
Creator creates a company VCS invest in

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:32,579
the company the companies build up the

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,040
brand and it it spreads and it starts

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,599
selling support services pro version the

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,310
extension and the company makes a lot of

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,319
money everybody's happy that's what

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,739
kinda kind of expected in some way and

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,900
the problem is and in an aside note

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,239
we've seen that one of the things that

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,319
they the creator hope that in this

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,000
process the community would would would

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,430
still be very present and that

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,909
themselves also would would contribute a

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,109
lot to open source code and actually

00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,639
what kind of happened as a side note

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,569
here is that VCS

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,879
sorry ah sorry I talked and I didn't

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,870
switch the slides I I thought I was on

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:17,810
screen uh okay good

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:21,630
so where's the button it's this one

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,240
green okay okay so I need sorry you

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,540
didn't see the slides sorry about this

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,670
so what actually happened is that VC's

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,770
didn't really care that much about how

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,980
much open-source code is being made

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,950
creators might care a lot there but the

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,410
VC's didn't really care about this and

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,750
and one of the things that also happened

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,960
in in decides is that the community and

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,030
the company they don't have exactly the

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,920
same interest in what's happening was he

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,620
around the open-source project and

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:58,770
sometimes they stop talking so now what

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,710
really happened what actually in in many

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,700
cases is actually from the from the

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,670
company's point of view selling and and

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,730
and the services might not have brought

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,220
back the return that the VCS wanted so

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,930
when I say the expected return that they

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,940
wanted is that it didn't necessarily

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,560
mean that the companies didn't make

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,170
money is that they didn't necessarily

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,730
make enough money compared to what is

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:28,170
expected from a VC back company and

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,700
another thing that happened is that an

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:38,600
alternative competition hosting hosting

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:42,180
the free version became has emerged so

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,280
it was shown Jill showed a good business

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,580
model around open sources to host it and

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,770
it makes sense to do it so it's not it

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,170
makes sense to do it and so and these

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,150
hosters don't necessarily participate to

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,280
the open source project and that that is

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,160
something that was not necessarily fully

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,270
expected from the the vc-backed

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,190
companies another thing is that the

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,990
another thing that happened is that

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,570
given that the returns were not as good

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,120
one of the strategies put in place by

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,950
the VC Park companies to say oh let's

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,990
push the investment more to some

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,260
proprietary components in our offer and

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,150
let's try to sell more of these and do a

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,940
bit less of an open source and that's

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,710
actually has the effect of separating

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,480
even more of the community from the

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,880
company because the company invest more

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,800
in the proprietary stuff and less in the

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,770
community and it's viewed as not not

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,130
very not that open and so the problem is

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,680
that if the if the results of this

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,370
strategy of selling new components new

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,110
proprietary

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,060
are still not enough for vc-backed

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,180
company then the vc-backed companies

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,389
starts blaming it on whoever else is

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,940
competing with them and and this leads

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,669
to the change of the license that we've

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,050
seen in a few cases here what's

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:03,960
interesting is that when you look at it

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,520
the companies were profitable I don't

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,229
think I don't I mean there is no sign

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,760
that they were not making money

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,870
it's just they were not necessarily

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,600
making enough money so now the thing is

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,780
are the OSS company's bad well the thing

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,060
is the new licenses are not open source

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,860
so they are not compliant with Zozi

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,790
they're there they're changing the way

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,780
open source works and they're not

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,010
compliant with that

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,190
however these companies that are have

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,440
made the open source software are major

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,199
contributors of open source software so

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,090
we should not forget that that there are

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,370
major contributors and they're not that

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,490
many major contributors of open source

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,830
software now our cloud companies bad

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,780
guys and when we analyze this well the

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,139
thing is on one side they do not

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,639
contribute that much in some cases they

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,900
do not necessarily contribute to the

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,139
software that they use and they make a

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,349
lot of business out of it however

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:06,599
nothing forbids it from the the

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,930
principle of open source software and so

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,970
we're kind of a bit stuck in a situation

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,110
with where we don't really know what

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:18,180
what's the right thing so now what is

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,550
the problem with the licenses themselves

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,700
yes I'm not switching at the same time

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:28,979
oops so what is the problem with so

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,419
actually I modified my slide so it's not

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:35,490
even the right side is there a way to

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:38,010
switch to the screen is there a way

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:45,779
because I don't have the right side it's

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:49,620
a bit bad no yes no okay no so well the

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,480
key thing is that first the new licenses

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,800
are breaking the open-source principle

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,630
they become more discriminatory now

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,600
thing is if we look a bit behind just

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,149
the paper like that say okay they're not

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,580
compliant well what do they actually

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:07,279
have an effect of they excluding so they

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,769
they target cloud providers very

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,930
directly like you can see it all we're

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,870
going to allow everything everybody can

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,670
do open source but not these ones but

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,680
not the cloud provider or they they

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,610
created in the level of your reality

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,880
that's basically impossible to comply to

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,190
from the cloud providers standpoint so

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,190
the problem is that one of the things

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,779
that these license the effect of this

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,560
license is that it's also potentially

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:39,200
exclude the principle of competition so

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,660
basically we're ok to give our software

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
but as long as there's no competitors to

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,380
us so they should not I mean it's ok

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,810
that users use it for free but it's not

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,209
ok that competitors that people that

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,540
would have a similar or slightly similar

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,860
business model of providing as a

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,779
significant service around that software

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,170
it's not ok that there are competitors

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:05,750
so so and that's actually a dynamic from

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,510
the printer the benefits of open source

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,050
it's not I mean the open source needs to

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,209
promote competition it's key in in in in

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,610
one of the good things of open source is

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:24,649
that it promotes competition and another

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:27,529
aspect is there is nothing that stops to

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:30,440
continue to exclude people so if you

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,630
start excluding people initially why not

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,240
I mean what's gonna be the where do you

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,370
go where are you going to stop so you're

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,980
never gonna stop excluding anybody that

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,350
is hurting your business so you don't

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,199
have control on this and one of the

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,540
thing that you can look at is open core

00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:49,520
was already there if you wanted to keep

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,790
an edge so if you want to keep an edge

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,300
on some of your software compared to the

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,459
an open source open source that you do

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,860
then you can you can already do it you

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,890
just need to do a package that is not

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,980
open source on top of your of your open

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,980
source package oops

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,850
how much time do I have

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:20,510
not much so what do we learn from this

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,760
so one is is that open source is not

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,870
very compatible it's not always

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,320
compatible with the level of of

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,960
financial expectations from the VCS

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,930
so if at some point you have you have a

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,840
potential issue there is that if if the

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,810
expectation of the VC is to maximize

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,510
revenue and maximize the protection on

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,420
there on on the business that they

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,120
created to get them and then get maximum

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,580
returns there is a bit of an issue here

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,460
because open source is supposed to

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,120
promote competition in a way so it's

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,040
going to it's difficult there to have a

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,460
compatibility between the level of

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,530
expectation from the VCS to them you

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:12,530
don't agree but it's my opinion VC so

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,300
and another aspect is that VCS and

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,850
creators could just use this as an

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,610
excuse to just go more proprietary so

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,990
they're just explaining look cloud

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:26,630
providers are bad guys are blood guys so

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,390
I have to do it I'm forced to do it just

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,470
instead of saying this is just what we

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,660
had planned to do since the beginning

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,430
and now another thing that I see is that

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,600
open source is too much use as a

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:45,080
freemium strategy so too many companies

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,880
in the end a big reason why all these

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,430
companies went to the open source model

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,430
initially might have been not for open

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,620
source itself but to use open source as

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,780
a way to distribute freely to customers

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,370
and at some point make them pay and that

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:02,270
that's actually a bit of a problem

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,760
because because what's good in open

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,410
source is not that that aspect is what's

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,630
good in open source is the fact that

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,360
it's open source and the problem is that

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,550
when their motivation is actually using

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,930
open source as a freemium strategy then

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,460
we have an issue because they are not

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,530
gonna stick to it over the long term

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,990
and so the businesses in general are not

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:25,060
are not carrying enough

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:28,160
about the the open source model I will

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,470
quick so one of the things I see also is

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,750
that we have a financial issue so

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,149
financing of open source is not a given

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:41,870
we there was there was a lot of

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:44,600
financing from from the through visas

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:52,720
but we might have less in in the future

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:57,290
and I lost a bit my slides here but

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,360
however there is one thing is that still

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,370
the financing of open source is not that

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,040
big has never been that big compared to

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,720
the software industry and Tobias

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,029
actually had a very good slides at

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,770
FOSDEM that showed the amount of money

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,360
put in developers which was something

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,880
like 300 billion and actually open

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,510
source doesn't go that much more than

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,850
then then 10 10 billion and maybe even

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,370
more if we count a few more but the the

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,370
issue that so open source has never been

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,640
the majority of the investment in the

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,440
software industry and so there there is

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,680
this issue of who's going to pay for it

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,870
in the future now I will finish with

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,440
that because I would be too long to go

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:42,470
through all the things it was difficult

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,510
to treat that subject in 15 minutes so

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:48,290
one of the things I think that in the in

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,120
the future one one of the reasons of

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,339
this problem that we're seeing is that

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,900
actually it's maybe the sign that cloud

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,310
and SAS have become more and more

00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:01,339
powerful in the software industry and

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:04,310
not I mean the problems of open source

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,810
business and difficulties for open

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,390
source business to accept the

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,910
competition is not something new it's

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,970
it's always been a difficulty in do when

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,149
you do running an open source business

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,610
but now that cloud and SAS is grow is

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:22,940
growing and become more important

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,100
mechanism of distributing software it is

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,260
it is a new type of competitor that

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,320
comes in and the problems that the

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:34,040
companies that have not planned for for

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,850
this evolution and and how they're going

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,350
to keep the

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,720
the business of open source compatible

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,280
with that have a difficulty so for me

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,940
one of the things is that companies need

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,430
to factor in much more the presence of

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,800
cloud and SAS in the business model of

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,410
open source company and where we still

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,960
have a fight for standards and open

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,670
source because cloud providers can use

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,560
open source and that's actually going to

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,960
be a good thing if they do because we're

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,120
going to have more openness in every

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,210
software that we use but they can also

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,980
use a lot of proprietary software in

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,080
their platforms when they can use a mix

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,080
so they can use open source a lot and

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,910
and and also use a lot of proprietary

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,250
software and in that case we're going to

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,790
have difficulties having open software

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,800
and open standards and we also have a

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,540
big risk of open source washing so

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,310
people saying ah we're doing open source

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,260
but in reality they're doing very little

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,930
of source compared to all the rest

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,060
they're doing and and the people that

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,800
are actually the companies and groups of

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,010
and the smaller companies that are doing

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,330
a lot of open source will be seen

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,310
exactly like that

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,440
this other big company that's doing just

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,390
zero zero one percent of open source but

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,230
has a great communication mechanism to

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:51,380
do it and we have this financing problem

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,050
where believers that are really

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,460
motivated by the idea that we need open

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,710
source software and that open source

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,980
software is a good thing we'll have to

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,200
find new new ways of funding I had more

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,420
slides with some more more solutions but

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,760
it's too short to do them and maybe I'll

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,380
do them in a future presentation thank

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,789
you
