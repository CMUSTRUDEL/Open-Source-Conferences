Description: 
	What's going on between VC Backed Open Source companies & Cloud providers ?

In this last year, we have seen an ongoing debate and flame wars about new Open Source licences, with Open Source VC backed companies changing their licences (Redis, MongoDB) and sometimes technical and business approach (Elastic Search) in a quite directed attack against large Cloud providers (AWS).
On one side, Open Source Companies state that their effort is being taken by the big cloud providers without giving back to the community. On the other side, the cloud providers and other actors are claiming the new approaches of the Open Source companies are not fully Open Source.
What's going on ?
What are the facts being the FUD of either side ?
What is at stake in this debate ?
Is this the end of Open Source and Free Software ?
What does this mean for launching new Open Source and Free Software businesses ?
Does this change how Open Source users and contributors should behave ?
If VC backed funding is not possible any more for "pure open source" are there alternatives ?
This presentation will show the view of an Open Source small business entrepreneur building an Open Source business for the last 15 years.
