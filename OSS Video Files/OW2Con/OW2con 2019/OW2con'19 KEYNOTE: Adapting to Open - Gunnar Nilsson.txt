Description: 
	"Adapting to Open". Ericsson keynote speaker Gunnar Nilsson, in charge of Open Source Strategies, explains that multiple use cases are currently emerging around the 5G mobile network. All are based on open source software. So, they require risk management and quality management to become new services or products.

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,480
yeah

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,719
my name is Gunnar I work in the CTO

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,880
office of Erickson and I basically do

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,210
open source both from governance

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,130
perspective and compliance and I will

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,720
keep it closer I hope and I also do

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,460
strategies for how we engage in

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,760
different open-source communities and

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,270
and foundations etc I will talk a bit

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,460
about how Ericsson has come into the

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,579
open-source journey and how we are

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,989
adapting to that openness and I think

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,250
you already heard certain of these

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,190
pieces from both nokia and Siemens and I

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,920
hope that I will not repeat everything

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,129
but somehow there are similarities here

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,710
going forward I will anyway start with

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,460
our 5g picture because I can't resist to

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,890
do that us as we are Eric's on but it's

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,899
not so much 5g itself that is important

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,689
here I think that yeah we have a 5g

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,500
vision that anywhere and anytime you can

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,330
use this for anyone or anything the

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,320
interesting piece for us here now is

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,780
that all of this is done with one one

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,810
big network one versatile network and

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,689
that versatile network is made up of a

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,130
lot of open source and and I think

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,290
that's why we're sitting here and that's

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,119
why all these different things are

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,710
happening I mean there are so many

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,470
things and there are so many new use

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,380
cases popping up each day basically and

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,270
and the way to do these use cases is to

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,579
take use of what is out there in open

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,070
source and either consume what's already

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,820
existing or create new things going

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,860
forward and I actually think that was a

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,110
good point given by some of the other

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,899
speakers as well that it's very much a

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,640
North American event open source and I

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,930
think it would be really nice to see

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,689
more European activity and being at

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,579
Europe seen in a wider sense than than

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,489
what we actually are today that would be

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,450
really nice going forward but looking a

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,250
bit on on our history and we we started

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,300
off

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,570
many many years ago decades by using

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,630
open-source as technology elements that

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,570
basically sneaked ourselves into our

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,400
systems and products because someone

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,710
figured out that it would be useful with

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,850
that sort of technology element being a

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,370
small bit of piece somewhere we didn't

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,020
really contribute open-source we had

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,240
some exceptions to this we had this

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,380
Erlang of Erlang language that we

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,270
released back in 99 for instance but

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,340
nevertheless this was very much just a

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,910
pure consumption of what was available

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,630
out there and and over the time this

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,700
grew and grew and and we became usage or

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,230
consumers of all these sorts of

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,540
different things but the first big

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,610
paradigm for us I would say was that

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,670
when we switched off from our

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,410
proprietary or sourced proprietary

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,020
operating systems and we started to use

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,959
Linux because then we suddenly came into

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,090
the scenario of having Linux and the

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,050
full ecosystem of Linux and suddenly

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,080
that boomed our use of open source and

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:31,280
even though we to a large degree sourced

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:36,800
Linux from the established vendors like

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,540
red hat or Monta Vista Zeus etc we we

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,459
anyway started to understand that okay

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,470
now we have all these open source we

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,620
need to actually understand how that

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,860
works we need to add things that we

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,860
didn't thought of initially and that

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,370
then started to get into the skin and

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,680
and the next big thing that happened was

00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,540
basically the virtualization then when

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,630
we had more and more of these bigger

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,910
projects that came directly into what we

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,580
might have seen as a bit of a comfort

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,890
zone and seeing as our network now

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,989
suddenly we have things like Sdn

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,810
controllers like open daylight we had

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:17,540
OpenStack we have we have a cloud native

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,359
going forward as well and these again

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,479
then put even more focus on that we need

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,789
to also be seen out there we need to

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,380
contribute things we can't be stuck in a

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,290
world

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,220
where we basically fork off and maintain

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,080
our own proprietary add-ons to these

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,160
open-source pieces because we are just

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,770
pushing a big churn of technical depth

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,390
and cost going forward so I think that

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,620
what we see here when we came into

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,300
virtualization is a much more active

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,000
participation in open source communities

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,470
from management perspective and I think

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,860
that the next step that we haven't

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,710
really come to yet astiz step where we

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,630
even more get activity in creating new

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,310
projects going forward today we have

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,470
basically joined projects and taking

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,990
part in contributing to projects I think

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,240
the next big step and that comes back to

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,860
the Europe thing as I see it would be to

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
try to figure out okay what are the

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,380
projects that we could establish in

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,390
Europe and drive forward but anyway

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,610
looking on our products today I would

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,380
say that most of all all or basically

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,840
all our products have open source in

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,940
some way of course Linux is there but we

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,920
use it all over the place and sometimes

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:36,040
we use it a lot and sometimes a bit less

00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,990
and also what's happened then over the

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,900
recent years especially then with this

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,390
virtualization and that stream is that

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,590
all these different projects have boomed

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:49,930
and there are so many of these and some

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,380
of them are rather similar or trying to

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,030
solve the same thing and some are coming

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,650
from an enterprise perspective some are

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,740
driving towards a telco more

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,780
specifically and there's also always a

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,580
hard choice to decide which one should

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,310
you actually invest in and which one

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,980
will be successful in this so this been

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,930
a bit of a headache for us previously

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,090
and probably today as well I would say I

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,950
mean if you look on the cloud native for

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,770
instance if you if you look outside of

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,750
the cloud native computing foundation

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,930
you will find that it's tons of

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,820
different projects and then cloud native

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,890
computing foundation they collect

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:33,280
roughly a set of 14 projects that are or

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,900
or mature war and and graduated and of

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,910
course it'll be tricky then ok out of

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,440
the other a hundred that exists there

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,340
which one should we actually choose and

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,949
which one will do

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,260
these things on and I guess there's not

00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,680
one choice there but but this is

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,389
something that we definitely are

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,010
scratching our heads on a daily basis to

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,680
figure out okay which one is the best

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,300
one for us today and that comes back a

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,270
bit too to the Gartner hype cycle in the

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,190
sense that all these projects they start

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,440
somewhere and they they are rather

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,630
attractive initially all of them they

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,360
you come into that they look shiny

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,540
basically and every round promises that

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,270
they will fulfill the needs that we have

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,820
but over time some of them will fade

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,280
away or at least there will be doubts

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,190
that will these actually fulfill what we

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,570
expected and and this is also something

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,350
that we have been struggling a bit with

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,910
internally that that we need to be we

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,280
need to have perseverance when we do

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,560
open source because not all projects are

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,900
ready in six months or a year or two

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,820
years for that sake so if we believe in

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,560
something we actually have to stick

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,010
around and drive that project going

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,479
forward and and I think that's that's a

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,639
big difference between successful

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,100
projects are not so successful projects

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:58,060
that that the successful one has managed

00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,940
to keep attraction and community active

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,039
also in in the dissolution where where

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,960
things are not looking that good you

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,669
have to re architect certain things you

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,150
have to rewrite certain pieces of your

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:13,120
code and those that maintain people that

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,740
maintain a sure enough community they

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,200
can actually come up to the productivity

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,720
again and provide something that is

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,700
really good I mean lean exists obvious

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,200
one that has success in all of these

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,419
things but I mean there are tons of

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,820
other projects that we also have that

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,410
that looks really promising or is

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,839
promising or actually have already

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:36,909
fulfilled all of these things then of

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,120
course when we use open source and

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,279
consume open source and we consume that

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,200
and usually that consumption leads to

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:49,240
some sort of need to do contributions

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,280
and and our consumption is then of

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,959
course also something that we need to

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,450
care for I think we heard about that

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,850
previous

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,120
as well I mean someone we want to when

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,490
we in license something we consume that

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,320
piece we don't understand okay is there

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,300
a risk-taking in this what sort of

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,690
licenses security trade compliance

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,970
quality issues to behave here and we try

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,930
to figure out that if this component is

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,400
the best for our business case or not

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,350
then we of course have to add that into

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,670
our production phase as well when it

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,270
comes to things like like basic probably

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,290
boring stuff in a sense of admin work

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,930
productive fiying these putting numbers

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,240
on these components and and basically

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,250
taking an ownership of that specific

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,010
code piece so that we can provide

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,890
support etc and maintenance towards our

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,630
customers and then of course we come in

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,550
to their compliance pieces in the end

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,680
where we want to ship something to a

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,200
customer and we don't want to fulfill

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,630
all the things that these open-source

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,120
licenses put on us from an obligation

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,240
perspective being copyright text being

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,240
like being a licensed tech store or

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,050
source obligations for that sake and of

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,610
course this is all this is all good as

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,480
we heard on another presentation it's

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,600
super simple

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,530
in unlike drawing paper but when you

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,720
come into the issues of new languages

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,280
and containers for instance and all of

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,860
these things you get all these

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,020
dependencies on products and and

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,420
suddenly you have a big mess of things

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,090
that you need to keep track of and we

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,280
are currently struggling a lot with

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:31,490
getting everything into I mean when when

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,610
a designer press the build button the

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,500
system or the container go out and

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,420
collect all sorts of stuff and of course

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,100
we need to figure out okay what did it

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,250
actually collect now so that we can

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,270
provide the green box here with when we

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,270
ship to our customers

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,410
so I would say that slowly it's growing

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:56,540
into our DNA when when it comes to open

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,910
source I mean we started off with that

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,740
we were very much reluctant in

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,290
understanding how we should relate to

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,059
open source of course there are

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,629
exceptions certain people understood

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,389
this from the from day one but but it

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,980
was also very much the things that was

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,389
previously said as well in the sense

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,279
that ok why should we give away

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,499
something why should we give this for

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,759
free and what's in it for us these sort

00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:25,699
of things were comments given and and I

00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,149
think that we we have gone from that

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:30,769
face to a face where we are more

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,899
understandable and we are more open in

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,389
the sense that we realized that yes of

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,509
course we should do open source and and

00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,939
this is just a rough picture of things

00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,949
that we are doing things in I mean we we

00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:47,209
do tons of open source when it comes to

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:48,829
our tool chain we we do a lot of

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:52,490
different things that go into our

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:54,889
runtime production over our our products

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,779
that is and then we have also a number

00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,329
of different research activities where

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,259
where we are trying out things going

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:05,389
forward and and and I think that I I put

00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:07,399
Erlang here as in in the top left hand

00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:09,980
corner because I think that's that

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,139
that's a that's probably the project

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,819
that Ericsson has done that still is

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,839
alive and actually have a very good

00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:20,660
community and and along is a language

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,680
that has been heavily bashed internally

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,860
in Ericsson due to all sorts of reasons

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,170
and and maybe it was a bit premature in

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,509
time when it was originally launched

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,189
basically but but I think that when

00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:36,559
looking on it today and looking on those

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:38,660
that actually take use of our line it's

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,459
a great language and and it's also a

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,490
great community that has managed to

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:47,499
survive over these almost 30 years soon

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,699
or 20 20 to 25 years of simple at that

00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:51,860
but then of course we are doing things

00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,709
in all sorts of ways I talked about the

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,009
tooling I talked about but our parts I I

00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,720
think we much of the project we do tie

00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:01,520
up to for instance the Linux Foundation

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,340
as was mentioned before

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,890
there are a number of different projects

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,090
there that that hit to us when it comes

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:15,590
to to things like the UNA or open

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,780
daylight etc we also look in OpenStack

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:22,910
and do things in relating to OpenStack

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:27,260
for instance okay so just to wrap up

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,300
then I as I said I think open source

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,520
will continue to be a very important

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,950
point piece of our software development

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,200
it will not go away and it will just be

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,350
more and more and I think we see that

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,500
each day that I mean we are consuming

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,540
all over the place and and and that's

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,140
that's not just one piece a day it's

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,330
many pieces are they and I also think

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,480
that the industry will continue to seek

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,490
new areas to innovate the open source I

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,130
mean that's that's the way to go I mean

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,410
it was mentioned before that it's so

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,720
complex today so you need to do use a

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:08,360
collaborative way for certain things to

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,890
to be happening I think that we we can't

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,800
do it ourselves and we would probably

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,870
not figure it out ourself either so so

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,760
someone will come with an idea and that

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,680
will be creating some sort of open

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,410
source initiative and that would then

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,960
boom that certain thing going forward

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,690
and that's why I also think there's a

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,580
need going forward and to

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,320
collaboratively establish new open

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,420
source projects that can address this

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,850
new business opportunities also I mean

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,730
we there was a bit of a word on that on

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,830
the introduction this morning relative

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:45,350
RedHat and and github I think that

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,780
that's of course the Chinese big ones

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,040
with a lot of money on it but but

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,870
there's a lot of other things that you

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,820
can do business-wise when it comes to

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,560
open source and you see this tremendous

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,700
amount of different companies doing

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,800
these things and we are basically not

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,280
doing that I mean we are still selling

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,010
our Ericsson label product but but I

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,570
think that it will be interesting to see

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,370
what sort of business models and

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,620
business opportunities there is going

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,500
forward and with that I would like to

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,860
close and and just come back

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,190
to the Europe versus North America or

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,750
even North America and China or Asia for

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,260
that sake and and sometimes it feels

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:29,020
like we are ending up like like the net

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,650
on a ping pong table where where the

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,450
ball is just passing by us and and I

00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,040
think we should raise that net a bit so

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,960
that we can actually catch the ball as

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,989
well going forward thank you very much

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,989
