00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,030
in fact we should start this roundtable

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,190
by mapping what you want to talk about

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,049
when we talk about compliance maybe want

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,560
about talk about governance and

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,650
contribution you want to talk about

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,480
quality and security and we may if we

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,869
have time talk about say the

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,269
architecture where if there is any sweet

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,219
spots so you'll represent here the

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,920
industry you represent the big companies

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,260
and your present illustrates our theme

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,790
towards industry maturity and this

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,070
afternoon we'll have more other

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,960
companies so the first question would be

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,809
it seems to compliance from your

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,100
perspective you guys seems to be and I

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,420
mean I'm not talking about standards I

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,920
don't talk about standards don't have

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,539
standards in the in the in the picture

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,960
here but compliance seems to be the

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,820
entry point through which you started

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,309
being engaged with open source because

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,680
it seemed all bits risky and you really

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,590
have to be very careful is that so is it

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,210
is it evolving you said it's combines is

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,010
very easy but you said also that

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,869
compliance is easy on the paper and

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,869
maybe not exactly so can you please

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,240
elaborate a little bit on this maybe I

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,090
can start because I watched evolution of

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,189
the companies here with such great

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,140
guests for over 20 years from being you

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,329
know extremely skeptical if not

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,200
understanding to being fully supportive

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:38,090
and even last that say five years was a

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,750
huge change from being lost and scared

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:46,229
about various various licensing models

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,869
to amazing speech today about for

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,320
example a GPL consequences and how it

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:55,799
impacts the software development and and

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
contribution and using open source being

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,719
fully aware of the constraints and

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,790
managing it in corporate processes so I

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,280
really admire the change that was that

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,709
happened over recent years that I

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,560
believe that now those huge

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,220
organizations

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:27,260
can really be compliant and aware of

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:29,770
that compliance yeah I probably add to

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,600
this a little bit in my opinion

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,970
compliance is really still a very

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,070
time-consuming task much more

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,800
time-consuming that it should be a huge

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:45,140
activity yes great and and what's also

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,040
still a white spot in my opinion is that

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,260
the compliance and tools are not really

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,280
integrated into the DevOps tool chain

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,190
yeah so my dream is to have at least a

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,380
big target which says for a product make

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,810
a spiriax or something like that and

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,510
then having all the compliance artifacts

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:11,720
generated automatically the problem is

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:17,630
that that's a variety of expressing

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,870
licenses is so huge that no tool which

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,410
is country on the world can really do

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,870
this in an automated fashion in my

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,420
opinion a compliance tool chain should

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,530
also be fully open source there should

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,260
be of course no no need for a commercial

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,170
vendor because every company is obliged

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,640
to do that because of copyright ACTA and

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:47,239
and and we have a huge comply chain and

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:50,239
my dream is that I receive compliance

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,190
artifacts from our suppliers in a way

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,660
that I simply can pass it through

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:59,329
through our customers okay and John yes

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,370
thank you very much and I would like to

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,579
kind of like continue with the same

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:07,400
theme there that so I have to say that I

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,950
have the benefit that I stand on the

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,650
shoulders of giants so there were people

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,540
behind before me that actually created

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,820
already our compliance program and we

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,060
have had compliance programs for a very

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,510
long time from the Nokia networks part

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,750
of you we have had a compliance process

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,090
and program already since 2004

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,750
and we have been using open-source for a

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,210
very long time but I our pain points are

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,980
most probably still the same that

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:41,960
everybody else has and coming back to

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:44,510
that what polliver said that they our

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,300
tools are not that good and I can say

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,940
that with good conscience because we

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,070
built our own tools we built them early

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,140
on and a tool that has been built by

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,070
somebody for doing a little thing called

00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:01,430
open source in 2004 in when every single

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,310
product has open source in it in 2019

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,060
isn't necessarily the best tool in the

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,580
world anymore

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,580
in addition how we do software has

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:16,970
changed from very much water flow model

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:19,130
to CIS CD and IA if I would get an the

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,140
old expression it would get a euro every

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,900
time that somebody would yell at me that

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,900
our tools are really really bad I would

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,610
be a rich man and the thing is also that

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,850
I agree with Halle Berry that we should

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,550
actually look at industry level

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,790
solutions to this and looking at

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,730
basically because that would not only

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,730
help everybody to use open-source help

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,919
everybody to be compliant in the right

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,410
way because that's also what we want is

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,720
to be compliant we get something from

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,000
the open source communities the least

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,760
that we could do is to be compliant with

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,550
the licenses on those but also that it

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,220
would nicely codify that what it does

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,770
the compliance mean so if everybody's

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,040
compliant in the same way that must be

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,690
the right way of being compliant as well

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,700
exactly so there are tools on the market

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,990
today whether open source or proprietary

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,110
and there's also initiatives such as

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,690
open chain looking at this how do you

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,880
see those two coming together

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,700
do you see tools like force ology you I

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,320
know we have people from Foss idea and

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,880
and other tools like that here with us

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,530
today how do you see them coming

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,169
together are people starting to

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,919
recognize that compliance is this this

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,470
issue still the in some ways

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,710
constraining industry around open source

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,600
well I know that

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:47,650
my friend costs and thinks as clients is

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:50,290
simple but I'm I'm much more aligned

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,000
with Olivier Olivier it takes it takes a

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,250
huge amount of workload and maybe there

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,750
are kind of AI technologies that can

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,080
help us with this but it's not going to

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,910
help us completely integration in CI CD

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,830
is a big issue it's going to increase

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,550
the speed around which we need to do

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,810
compliance we expect more and more

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,790
reactivity from our developers and

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,740
quicker releases but of course then

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,260
means we need more reactivity around the

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:20,170
compliance process so how did you see

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:22,810
this coming together so from we we call

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:27,160
maintain facility and and we also

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:30,790
maintains a software 360 so and and we

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,140
are also engaged with with Foss ID and

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:38,260
all the other vendors so in my opinion

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:42,100
still there is room for for the

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,160
commercial vendors but at least the the

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,640
interfaces in order to connect to to

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,920
their tools should be implemented as an

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,800
open-source project otherwise there

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,410
there is no chance anymore because you

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,080
are we have I think in achievements we

00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,600
have tons of different build tool chains

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,150
and and saying oh we have a connector to

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,210
with Jenkins is does not help us here

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:13,300
out of the problem so we need connect us

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:15,820
to all those tools home ok yeah I should

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,000
say anything yeah there's a fan thing so

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,460
I didn't say that

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
creating compliance is simple I said

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,120
that we know that what we have to do in

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,900
the past we discussed licenses and what

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,900
they mean this is a phase which is gone

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,830
we know what we have to do the problem

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:42,600
is the mess of the software and how

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:46,660
often we have to do the same thing and

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:51,030
indeed we do not have the tools which

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:57,660
allow us to automate the complete

00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:01,470
chain and I want to emphasize another

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,950
aspects of the open-source compliance

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:09,270
why do I love the topic open-source

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:12,900
compliance others love to code I love

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,560
compliance why without open source

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,640
licenses we do not have any open source

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,670
software only the licenses allow us to

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,280
cooperate if we create a piece of

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,850
software if we license this offer and

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,490
any open sources and we can cooperate

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,780
based on this license there is no need

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:40,580
to make another contract it is very

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:44,310
simpler and this is the base of our

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,970
business in the future and therefore it

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:51,320
is important that we take the compliance

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,840
as a topic seriously agreed

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,540
well thank you next great things is

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,150
that's topic of compliance is there any

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,050
question on this topic compliance from

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:09,300
from the audience please all means and

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,280
you need a microphone it has to be a

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,060
short question myself we agreed the

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:19,410
short question is he knows he knows me

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:22,050
too long the point is you agree

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,640
basically all of this kind of companies

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,230
to that a little bit of mess in

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,610
open-source

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,340
wouldn't it be time to have one general

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,580
standard for components and reuse of

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:39,420
open source which could really fulfill

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:43,710
this kind of lego idea and couldn't you

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,960
be the consortium as telecom massive

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:52,650
companies to establish something like

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:54,540
that for us good question so we we are

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,730
currently working with with other

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,420
interested companies in an open source

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,880
project which which is called sharing

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,010
creates value which is about the open

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,390
source compliant

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,520
spoole channel to build up the

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,040
open-source compliance tool chain so

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,210
this is one open-source project where we

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,090
are working on

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,460
there's also another initiative going on

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,830
which is called act the automated

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:24,500
compliance tooling I think from the

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:26,720
Linux Foundation and we have also Oscar

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,450
this project from the Eclipse Foundation

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,630
so you see there are these energy

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:36,040
initiatives popping up what me concerns

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:40,610
personally a little bit is already this

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:43,400
fragmentation yeah we in my opinion we

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,180
need an umbrella organization which

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,630
really let's say works together with all

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:54,200
those initiatives in order to avoid

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:58,160
fragmentation and double work nothing

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,710
Kisame yes um let me add a quick shot

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,510
especially and very quick our clear

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,300
answer to the question whether Deutsche

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,900
Telekom and for example Siemens can

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,170
build set up and take dictate the

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,870
solution they own the solution has to be

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,810
adapted by the community we can only

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,790
support the community and if we are in a

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,710
phase where distributed different

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:29,180
solutions we have to go through these

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:31,100
phase community bottom-up it has to be

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,110
borne a reversal Thank You Roberto on

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,310
ocean ok sorry thanks a lot for your

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:39,080
presentation really fascinating I think

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,890
the question and the remark very quickly

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,320
the key to solving this compliance issue

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,140
I think has been seen that many time is

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,950
getting to an agreement on a standard on

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,140
how to create and manipulate these

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,390
compliance documents one starting point

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,880
which is very important to all agree on

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,820
the reference data set of the source

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,330
code on top of which we compare we

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,190
extract with our compliance information

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,170
as if some of you know I'm reading a

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,120
project whose name is sort of heritage

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,710
we are building a new universal archive

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,260
of all the source code around the world

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,940
our God is not to do

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,300
we are not a company we are foundation

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,310
but we are providing base that you can

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,290
use with standardized identifiers

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,470
everything needed to build on top of it

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,390
I have heard your remark about your

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,310
complaint but the fact that Europe is

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,560
not so much present premiere and you

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,630
want to raise this net when I would

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,370
suggest you to have a look at what we do

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,280
software headers it is a unit

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,100
international organization but it is

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,920
built in Europe based in France and I

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,190
have to say up to now I see a lot of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,250
American and Chinese partners with us

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,880
not a single European one in this vendor

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,820
space

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,300
so yes you can complain by things you

00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,300
should act thank you what our question

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:10,370
so Kota action to Europe okay well thank

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,770
you could add something but we refrain

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:15,170
and move on to the next topic of this

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,640
roundtable which is the compliance is

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,040
where you come from naturally because

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,430
it's all about risk and making sure you

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,770
avoid any litigation and using operative

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,250
software the wrong way and mixing it the

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,720
wrong way and and of course I understand

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,090
from a traditional commercial

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,970
perspective this free thing is something

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:37,270
that is very counterintuitive and you

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,190
really have to be prepared now another

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:44,270
another issue that may become to country

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,310
intuitive is to use the software but to

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,920
make sure that you don't kill the the

00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,050
goose with the golden eggs and you make

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,180
sure that it keeps providing software

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,000
but it can only keep providing software

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,960
if you contribute back and if you make

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,570
sure that the source keeps alive so how

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,320
do you how do you proceed what are the

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,390
other any governance tactics what can be

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,070
the best practices to make sure to

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,040
understand to make people understand the

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,050
management understand that it's not only

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,670
legal piracy that to use the software

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,770
but you really have to contribute to

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,850
make it and build it at at some point it

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:25,010
will cost something unit yeah thank you

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,040
a very good question and this is

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,120
something that we think about it all

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,750
more or think about all

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,620
most every day the first thing is that I

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,990
think that version when we started to

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,700
use open source we came with this moral

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:46,070
question are we just exploiting this or

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,650
is it ok that we just use it or should

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,510
we contribute as well and we came to the

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,070
conclusion yes you have to contribute as

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,650
well of course and that's the right

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,290
thing to do in the kind of from moral

00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,760
perspective but actually that what I

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,650
said also a little bit in my

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,870
presentation I think that when you think

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,430
about it further any use lot more of

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,380
open source you notice that there is

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:11,360
always something little things to fix

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:13,760
and if you take the code yourself and

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,900
you fix it just for yourself you're not

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,480
actually kind of like being exploiting

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,550
you're just being stupid because what

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,339
you actually do is you fork from the

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,560
from the upstream and you were actually

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,779
you think that you're creating something

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,690
that is beneficial for yourself but you

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,450
are actually hurting yourself and this

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,160
is something that what we have been

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,820
basically making people understand

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,250
inside the company that if you fork you

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,000
are in trouble and like I said we had an

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,370
example where we used FreeBSD we forked

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,470
it and did a lot of cool things in the

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:56,420
networking stack back in 1998 that was

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,490
our differentiation that was we were

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,070
really good it was a really good stack

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:05,329
and we were building products on that

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:10,429
then came multi-core processors and the

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:13,550
FreeBSD from 1998 did not do as a

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:17,420
symmetric multi core multi processing at

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,030
all so we were all of a sudden in front

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,740
of a dilemma where we had all this

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,780
differentiation which was not that

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,059
positively differentiating anymore

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,030
anyways because actually the community

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:32,300
had gotten ahead of us even though those

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,860
features but also our software just

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,980
didn't do that what the opens were

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,690
software did and we you could not just

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,940
say well we'll take the open source

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,920
software and start again that meant we

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,920
had to rewrite the software or the

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,720
whole product again so if you don't

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,090
contribute back what you're actually

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,790
doing is you're hurting just yourself so

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,710
it's actually in your benefit to always

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,530
contribute back it's not just Memorial

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,320
right and one small thing as well is the

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,700
compliance you need some compliance also

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,170
to contribute you have to understand

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,850
what license it is and what you are

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,700
giving out while you're doing that and

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:11,180
what is the job of the compliance team

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,430
is to make sure that you do contribution

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,920
responsibly but stay out of the way of

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,320
the contributors and this is something

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,110
that we've learned as well you cannot

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,630
check every contribution there's no way

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,670
of doing that you will just hurt as the

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,830
contributor make sure that you have a

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,330
different way of making sure that you do

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,920
contribution responsibly

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,890
thank you I think Oliver won't say and

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,760
then Conrad's a systems integrator

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,590
country contributing back Oliver so we

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,970
we love contributions back to the

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:45,890
community now we also have a

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:51,380
company-wide template process in order

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:54,050
to do that the problem is the Copyright

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,910
Act because at least in in in Germany

00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:00,170
and in the Copyright Act it's written

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:02,300
that the commercial rights in software

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,850
developed by a software developer as

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,790
part of his duties are automatically

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,830
transferred to the employer so the only

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,570
person who really can license the

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:16,870
software on an open-source license

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,870
written in a in a company context is

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,870
representative of the senior management

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:25,730
and and this is sometimes a hurdle

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,880
because it involves a lot of

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,990
stakeholders and especially if we are

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,450
facing projects which require clas to be

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,110
signed this is a nightmare for a company

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,560
to be really honest and and but we have

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,770
also some some other let's say

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:49,660
exceptions of this proptosis which is

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:52,460
based on on a trust basis we do have

00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,190
developers who really contribute to the

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,140
Linux kernel on the daily basis they

00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,840
have it

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,670
some some exceptions for contributions

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,929
and not to pass the entire big process

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,540
it's extremely important to really

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,850
understand that contribution matters but

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,210
it's from my perspective just a

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:16,059
beginning of a problem because if we

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:20,380
contribute then it's great but someone

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:23,470
needs to accept those contributions into

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,900
the core product to have it life simply

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,780
if you contribute but your contribution

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,549
is ignored and the platform software

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,330
whatever goes in different direction

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:36,490
then actually the problem you've had is

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,640
the very same just for a different

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:42,669
reason so it brings us to to governance

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,000
of the of the open-source products when

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:47,830
just to give a concrete sample the

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,130
governance of kubernetes by Google

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,570
versus approach to contribute by IBM and

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,669
Red Hat now the same company but

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,110
completely different approaches one of

00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:01,140
them very successful okay one of them

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:06,760
succeeds more or less another one one

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:10,380
fails miserably so it's about governance

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:14,440
of those projects how to build not only

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,880
how to build ecosystem around it I think

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,290
this is really an important point and I

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,480
know I think it is gonna the the

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,940
mentioned that doing good open source or

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,000
doing great open source is kind of about

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,520
persistence and I I really like that

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,350
term because it touched a nerve where

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,910
you know you have project teams who are

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,919
gonna say I'm gonna do open source and

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,900
there's my project and I've put it I've

00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,350
put the code out on github or wherever

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,200
and and then I go right now I move on to

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,940
the next project and it's kind of the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,100
wrong mentality they need to think about

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,020
okay but putting it out there is the

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,970
start of the journey it's not the end of

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,820
the journey and this is something we see

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,080
too often the companies or projects are

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,760
putting code out there they're saying

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,470
okay I'm contributing back to the open

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,450
source community there's my code and

00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,890
then they kind of forget about it so I

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,799
think that the the point you raised

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:05,440
there is how do you then manage the

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,090
lifecycle after the release getting back

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,290
the contributions having an engaged

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,450
community I think these are critically

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,220
important questions which industry still

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,320
struggles with and is not in the

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,020
business model of industry generally to

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,390
look at that question i just want to add

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,430
on that because i think the same thing

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,160
applies on our consumption internally

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,440
because when we consume these amounts of

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,690
share amounts of open source that

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,060
becomes like a black box for us and and

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,740
of course the way to know we need to

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,510
know the code and the way best way to

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,060
know the code is to take part in these

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:41,060
communities do the upstream activities

00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:44,330
up front and and that means also that

00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,490
that black box becomes at least greyish

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,220
and then we also can act on whatever

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,500
support issues we need on it trying to

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,750
reduce the technical debt I think I

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,850
think the the major point which which is

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,640
still to be learnt by some managers is

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,860
that an open source project is nothing

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,290
else than a software development project

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,750
there you need the budget you need the

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,020
manpower and you need the marketing so

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,910
it's it's a product introduction and and

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,600
thinking oh I put this code into the

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:17,450
public and do it evolves like I want to

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,230
have it this is this is totally wrong

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,270
you need to have the budget available to

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,420
maintain the project yeah the only

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:29,660
difference to a normal internal product

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,790
or a software project is that everything

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,590
is done in the public that's the only

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,630
difference but at least you need the

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:41,960
budget exactly yes thank you so the

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,180
first of all so in our pro process how

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,860
kind of like two things so sharing here

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,410
in open source fashion a little bit our

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,510
our process so first of all the to all

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,720
of you guys who we have kind of like

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,430
looked at the way of that who has the

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,380
right to contribute is that we have a

00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:00,950
process that has been approved by our

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,230
cielos or our chief legal officer and we

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,870
go through their project or process not

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,400
every contributor not every and by the

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,920
way we don't actually look at every

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,280
contribution what we look at is that we

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,590
give a right to contribute your Center

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,200
intern area to a project or part of a

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:21,620
project or to your technology and as

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,940
it's done within the process that gives

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,040
us the management

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,810
okay to that the people who have the

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,330
right to do this had can do that and

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,160
they can and the the idea is really that

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,200
the product line really does it

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,300
themselves rather than anybody looking

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,860
over their shoulder

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,630
and the thing is that when we have if

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,420
things that we look at in this product

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,030
we have a look at the legal aspects so

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,360
what is the CLA what is the what is the

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,810
license we look at IPR aspects we have

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,120
an successful IPR licensing business

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,340
which we don't want to risk and we look

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,710
at a business aspect and I have to know

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,140
just among friends here say that the

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,880
business aspect is more is is the person

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,970
who wants to contribute are they're

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,220
saying or are they are they crazy and

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,110
then one of the checks there is really

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,300
that is this fire-and-forget

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:18,310
and if it's somebody who says like I

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:22,340
have this great code my my resource

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:24,530
research kind of project or my product

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,080
is coming to end we have this great code

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,660
I just want to dump it out that's where

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,910
we usually say no that's not the right

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,550
thing to do we want to look at that you

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,460
actually have the resources to keep that

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,160
alive and then we go also other things

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,960
like are you sure you need there is a

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,800
need for a new project in the world or

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:49,640
not yeah I think it's it's actually a

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,260
journey it's not contributing disappear

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,370
it's a journey because actually when you

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,050
contribute the code you have to learn

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,120
how the community works you have to

00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:59,180
understand who is important and you have

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,960
to gradually learn and merge into that

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:05,500
and it's not investment yeah and this

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,370
for sure for sure the North American

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,800
organizations that you were mentioning

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,110
are probably here because open source

00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,420
being an avatar of the North American

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,070
industry sort of industry we can they

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,840
are much more powerful than there are

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,760
here in Europe and you naturally tend to

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,250
look at them because they have some more

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,470
firing power that's for sure but another

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,620
thing compliance so comprises investment

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:33,830
and contribution come contributing back

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:36,330
as an investment and it means in time

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,310
the other thing is

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:42,520
open-source software is not free

00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,770
so as you all here are ahead of your

00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,210
opposite strategy or person thinking

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:50,080
your the openness of thinkers of your

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,510
own large organizations can you just

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,630
share with us some of the arguments or

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,640
the what you had back in terms of is

00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,620
open source free or why you would have

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,510
to spend money on open source and also

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,670
there's this question of support because

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,440
we talk a lot about the community but

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,660
for me the community is only one part of

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,280
these operational story there are many

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:13,030
companies out there that provide

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,370
actually for fee support so do you work

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,620
with them is it Nick and commercial

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,600
ecosystem that you consider something

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,120
you have to sell in internally how do

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,300
you engage with these people gonna yeah

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,750
I think we do all of those and many more

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,190
I think that we for sure we take use of

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,450
companies in different ways as I

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,850
mentioned I mean we we acquire we source

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:40,960
Linux from the likes of Reddit the Wind

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,760
River or all those kind of companies we

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,500
take use of different open source

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,200
companies that actually do open source

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,570
in a specific project also to use as

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,520
professional services basically and

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,850
that's very much because they happen to

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,880
have that knowledge and they have that

00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:01,150
channel into those communities yeah so

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,270
then I think we have we have a history

00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:07,450
of seeing open sources just free and no

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,090
cost whatsoever and and and the cost for

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,180
open source has have a tendency to be

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,890
hidden in the project because I mean

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,870
someone selects that open source piece

00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,000
puts that into that during that project

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,390
and then that's released and and the

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,980
cost of compliance and the cost of

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:26,110
integration and verification and and

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,440
lifecycle management of that component

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:32,620
never really surfaces as a separate cost

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,350
item somewhere so I think we are still a

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,960
bit in the in the dark when it comes to

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:41,380
how much to actually open source cost us

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,720
as a full or indie machine in that sense

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,050
we are starting to get the light on that

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,660
partly but but far from complete

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:58,559
I saw a custom and unbeliever smile at

00:28:51,660 --> 00:29:02,100
your comments I agree that that let's

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,630
say the total and number of investment

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:09,270
regarding money in open source is I

00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:11,640
cannot say it because I I do have at

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:16,020
least a feeling of the compliance costs

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:20,250
at Siemens but the the contribution

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,970
effort since it's done in the units I do

00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,480
not really can can say anything about

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,270
that

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,429
the only thing which which I can say is

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:35,190
that the the old sentence which is you

00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:38,250
have to pay either cash or code so and

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:43,770
and today I would say and in future you

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:46,140
have to pay cash end code I think what

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,030
you guys are raising here is one of the

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,670
comments kind of Hawks back to what I

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:53,520
said at the beginning is that open

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,470
source is not easy and it's not evident

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,910
and it changes the way of thinking and I

00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,220
think that change of thinking that

00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:01,020
culture of thinking within businesses is

00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,120
still not complete I think we've only

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,100
kind of started the journey the costs a

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,630
hidden you don't know how much your

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,280
company is investing in open source

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,660
because you know it's being done by so

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,160
many developers in so many different

00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,660
ways and I think lazy these are key

00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,090
messages and who is they kind of ring a

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,370
bell from me I know we only have a few

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,200
minutes left so I think we're gonna open

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:23,010
the the questions to the flow in it yes

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,429
or you've already asked a question

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:31,650
Marcel did we get we're gonna try a Jill

00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:36,420
here nice try I just wanted to make a

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:38,790
comment on open sourcing code first by

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,290
starting by saying you know if you're if

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,120
you're not contributing but you're just

00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,590
working you're basically creating your

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,480
own vendor lock-in which you don't want

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,530
when you use open source but more

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,350
importantly when you're contributing

00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,880
your own code out there and you push it

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,670
out there one thing nobody's mentioned

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,230
is that it's not because it's out there

00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,210
that people are going to want to

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,860
contribute and sometimes you add a

00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,550
prison github repository that has three

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,340
contributors

00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,740
all from the same company your company

00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,630
and and nobody else so keep in mind when

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,640
you're open sourcing your code it

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:14,460
doesn't mean others people will be

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,740
interested in contributing to it if I

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,050
may quickly on this so you're absolutely

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,640
right and this is something that people

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,980
think that there is some magic to

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,570
open-source when once you oh when once

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,940
you make something public they will come

00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,340
that will not happen there are also

00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,160
things that you might want to look at to

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,530
make it more positive for people to come

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,250
and one thing that I was actually wanted

00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,870
to comment but Oliver said about clas we

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,940
haven't really seen that problem with

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,220
clas that you have but what we see a

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,850
problem isn't kind of from when you have

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,940
an exotic CLA which says that by the way

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,100
you gave all your rights to me rather

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,280
than to an to the open source community

00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,410
and plus we want these and these patent

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,840
rights from you as well and that's when

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,850
you go like well no we won't really want

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,340
to be involved in those kind of things

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:09,990
and so if you want your open source

00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,030
you're kind of like a community to be

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,710
successful you really have to look at

00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,390
the governance you have to look at the

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,030
licenses that they are fair for people

00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,740
who also to contribute to those that

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,200
they are not that you are just trying to

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,870
get something from the contributors to

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,880
yourself thank you

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:32,930
maybe one and we have time for one more

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,930
question okay Walter Halle coats coop

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,930
European software and open source in

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:42,330
Europe and leadership so I think you

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,030
guys there you you are very much the

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:48,000
leadership of the open source in Europe

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:51,150
and and it was pointed out many times

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,010
that where is Europe in these charts and

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,980
everything Oliver was showing that then

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:58,650
and I'm pretty sure that in Europe we

00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,530
don't like any of the brain power or the

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,880
capacity we have so many developers here

00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,880
and and and so on but

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,120
what's the problem really like how do

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,730
you guys see this that what is the

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,340
bottleneck and what can we all do to

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:22,200
change this in my opinion it's it's it's

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:25,920
it's a matter of culture change so the

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,950
big companies are still in the face

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,940
where they they are in on this journey

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:37,049
of culture change and and we have some

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,620
some nice developments inside the

00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:43,080
company that there are several units

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,700
which say ok upstream first and then we

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:51,630
took it from from the vanilla project

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,669
but you still have to convince the

00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:58,679
senior management that this is the only

00:33:53,669 --> 00:34:01,770
way to survive to be open to be

00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:05,490
collaborative and and and there are

00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,730
enough possibilities to generate new

00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:11,940
revenue streams so it's it's still a way

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:15,869
of culture change in my opinion it is

00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,240
culture but it's not about continents

00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:22,260
it's not about even countries it's about

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,389
local ecosystems that for example west

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,300
coast innovation ecosystem in u.s. is

00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,830
completely different than East Coast and

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,379
if you check the statistics who

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:34,350
contributes the most a West Coast would

00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:37,619
be on top East Coast would be behind

00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:41,490
Europe ok at least some places in Europe

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:45,889
so it's around it's again building a

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:49,740
community about a building ecosystem

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,230
with proper funding I believe and and

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:57,030
maybe that the last thing is what is

00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:00,210
where Europe lags behind regarding visas

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,220
for example but horizon 2020 is actually

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,859
huge opportunity so we are simply

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,760
different it's not working the same way

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:12,480
as as in some key regions key global

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,760
regions but what we are building here it

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,250
starts to matter I strongly believe that

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,230
hmm yeah I'd like to add to that in

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,290
orange as I said his orange is hugely

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,820
active in open source communities and if

00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,620
you look at for example the owner

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,290
Finnish ative through the Linux

00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,570
Foundation orange is one of the key

00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,220
players within that so I think it's it's

00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,650
a question of this culture change is

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,300
happening but it's it's not it's not

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,340
naturally it's not easy and I think

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,700
there is this difference of funding

00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:45,070
which would enable more projects to go

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,600
out there take the risk engage with

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,190
communities and see how the business

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,230
develops I think there's still also a

00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,730
certain risk aversion that we have

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,430
within Europe when you compare to the

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,650
u.s. or maybe to certain Chinese or

00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,630
Asian countries but I think I agree with

00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,350
you we have the the expertise er that's

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,350
