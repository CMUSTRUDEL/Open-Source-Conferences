	00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:06,390
so I'm busting Gary I'm really the next

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,059
guy because I didn't even start as a

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,349
developer I used to be a to study

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:16,920
philosophy of science and then I met

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:20,279
then I read paper some papers about free

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,590
software by Richard Stallman and he has

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,340
this very straightforward definition of

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:30,510
free software being freedom equality and

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:35,969
fraternity so I thought a lot about this

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:38,149
and from this day on convinced that our

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,040
democracies will rely more and more on

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,140
software and if they do rely more and

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,660
more on software and not just the public

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,969
sector but everything in our democracy

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:55,530
then software has to be free as in free

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:58,710
speech so I'm gonna present things about

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,489
what we do in the public sector it's not

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,530
about promoting my role is not I'm the

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,049
free software officer but I don't see my

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,369
role as promoting free software into the

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,189
administration but more as opening the

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,850
administration to collaborations with

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,960
citizens companies associations and I'm

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:25,409
really glad to show what we are doing in

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,900
the open-source ecosystem and this is to

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,360
open the dialog between what we do and

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,450
what we need from the ecosystem and what

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:38,880
you can bring to our ecosystem we have

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,530
like four challenges for free software

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,979
in the administration the first one is

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,939
to release free software considered to

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,820
be open data the second one being

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:53,040
explaining algorithm and opening the

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,500
source code of software that we use in

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,100
the administration for individual

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,930
decision making processes and to use

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,290
free software and open source as a

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,910
technical leverage to enhance per

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,770
services and also to use the open source

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,640
to attract more developers more

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,130
designers and

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,860
skilled people into the administration

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,160
which is as we can imagine a big

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,080
challenge that we have to face so free

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,930
software as open data I'm not sure

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,700
everyone knows here but the law for

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,340
Digital Republic in 2016 is considering

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,070
software paid by the administration to

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,990
be open data to be public information so

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,950
the administration has to release it the

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:44,710
same way it has to release open data for

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,050
example this this is big it means that

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:51,660
when we are contracting with the company

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:55,090
we have to make sure that we can handle

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,740
copyrights correctly so that we can

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,690
release the source code that we are

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,280
paying for so this is the early stage of

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,960
opening the source code that the

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,420
administration has been paying for and

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,960
this is very interesting this is a very

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,990
low level groundwork about fixing read

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,630
means helping the administration

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,800
understanding everything about the free

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,380
software licenses and propagating good

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,100
practices about how to publish software

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,800
and so this is partly my job I do this

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,870
half of the time answering questions by

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,239
some ministry or some public

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,630
organization outside and then helping

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,400
them publishing a software so it'll AB

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,180
this is the name of the Open Data

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,420
mission in France so this is part of my

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,550
job as being a member of a Talab and it

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,070
alibies part of the dean's ik which is

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:55,390
the administration responsible for

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:58,780
everything in the IT sector in France we

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,890
have two programs in within the Dinsey

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,580
the first one is called beta groove it's

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,610
public sector of startups doing a

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,730
publishing serve public services and

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,950
doing it using open source and releasing

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,100
then their code source from the

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,019
beginning we also have entrepreneur

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,410
Dante Regina value which is the name for

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,660
a program inspired by Obama's

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,090
presidential innovation Fellows

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,820
where you have to send data scientists

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,430
designers and developers into the

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,200
administration's working with civil

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,540
servants to enhance the the the public

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,450
services so they I have to take a very

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,020
small problem that you want to fix with

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,630
code and we bring new we help them hire

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,660
the right skilled people for that and

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:56,410
both programs beta groove and Public

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,050
Interest entrepreneurs brings a lot of

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,030
new source code that I gonna show in a

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,300
minute

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,570
the second topic that is sometimes

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,670
confused with the first one so on the

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,030
open data side the administration has to

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,790
publish things because there are public

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,560
information and this is for transparency

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,500
this is not yet for collaboration but it

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,520
is for transparency the other topic is

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,490
about publishing algorithm so many maybe

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,850
some French people here heard about Paco

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,250
soup for example so Paco soup is the

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,540
system that the French Ministry of

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,630
Education is using to let students know

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,480
where they can go at the University to

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,940
see it very shortly there are lots of

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,640
problems with this new system but this

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,030
is a system and it use it uses an

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,410
algorithm so in terms of transparency

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,000
the state has to explain how it works

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,210
so etta lab has been working with the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,090
people there to produce a document that

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,280
is readable by anyone it's French

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:11,140
PDF document explaining how it works

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,790
this is not source code because we have

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,640
to distinguish between algorithm

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,490
explanations and source code but for

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,440
many decision making processes

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,720
source code will be part of the

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:28,180
publication and of the explanation and

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,370
we are providing a guide to help adrene

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,770
use administrative to know whether they

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,680
have to explain some algorithm this is

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:42,220
not a very very simple decision to make

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,810
as technical leverage we have been

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,630
building a catalog name the SIL sock

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,970
antara ministerial Dolores el Libre so

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:56,440
it's a catalog of free software that is

00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:01,060
recommended by civil servants working in

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,160
the central administration so it's not a

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,520
limited list of things that public

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,770
administrations can use but when they

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,590
see a software free software in the seal

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,660
in this catalog they know they can use

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,610
it and they know there is a central

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,920
ministry and there is some skilled

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,380
people in the central ministry that are

00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,720
using it effectively for a few years and

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:27,850
that can help other administration to

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:31,750
use it also more recently we started to

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:35,470
look on github to find public agencies

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:39,190
organizations and we found quite a lot

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:41,670
of them and with we been harvesting all

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,510
the repositories and so now there are

00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:49,320
2000 repositories published by public

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:53,110
agencies so this is the very early stage

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,170
but we are we're going to provide web

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,450
interface where you can search for

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:01,150
public repositories published by some

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:05,950
public organization so and we do this

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:09,570
not just to cover everything we don't

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,900
want to target exists Eva T as the first

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,550
quality for this web page but we want to

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,970
provoke more mutualization between the

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,210
administrations so if the city of Paris

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,000
is doing something with software that

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,710
they develop we want the city of

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Bordeaux to be able to find it more

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,080
easily and to create more opportunities

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,260
for collaboration because mutualization

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,780
has to be pushed and encouraged it does

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,940
just does not happen by chance last year

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,070
we published the open source

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,130
contribution policy of the public sector

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,790
and one of the main message in this

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,280
policy is that

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,080
you as a civil servant in the public

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,670
administration you don't have to ask for

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,930
permission when you want to contribute

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:02,480
to some outside software again even for

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,090
this this is the early stage so we need

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,530
to let every ministry and every

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,290
organization understand and use this

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,830
policy more and more and the tool for

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:22,040
that is blue huts so we started the new

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:24,700
community called blue hats sure IBM will

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,110
appreciate we started with this name

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,940
because the blue is to cut off the

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,820
administration so it's just the idea

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,380
that as a developer you may not know

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,060
that there are other developers in

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,670
another ministry working on the same

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,580
free software than you are for example

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,220
kubernetes maybe you are some ministries

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,710
using it you are providing patches so

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,370
not only you are free to provide patches

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,380
upstream but you are also encouraged to

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,390
wear blue hats in a conference in the

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,750
Cuban leaders conference and then meet

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,840
other civil servants out there and we

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,690
think this is this might be a way to

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,700
attract more developers to consider

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,130
ourselves being a community so

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,540
administration is a lot of boxes within

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,380
boxes we try to think and behave outside

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:17,020
the box

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,040
even though that's an everyday challenge

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,000
so

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,100
moreover we try to build collaboration

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,410
at all the level not just the state

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:32,810
central level and the ministries but

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:36,140
also the level of local public agencies

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:40,730
trying to work with local Association

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:46,120
all our local companies and to encourage

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:49,130
direct contribution from citizens so I

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,860
now are gonna show some figures and some

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,920
screenshots that I can explain I don't

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:59,840
know how much time have got left like ok

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,110
tournaments so I talked about beta goof

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,540
beta goes right now

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,480
seventy-five public sector startups and

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,300
growing because betta goo is now

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,610
extending this idea of small teams

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,920
fixing IT with open-source fold the

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,980
administration they are extending this

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,200
IDs to Knott central not just central

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:28,360
administration but to cover all the

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,180
territory we have 71 entrepreneur data

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,200
general so far in three years

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,470
and those entrepreneurs are working on

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,300
challenges by teams of two or three with

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,690
the data scientist developer designers

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,040
multis like that and this program will

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,740
continue next year and we want also to

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,519
reach not just central ministry

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,010
ministries but also territories the

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,519
series right now

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:03,160
160 software and there is a plan to open

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,769
here opening the seal even more i mean

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,529
for now this is just a list so you're

00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:12,550
reassured when your city that some

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:15,250
ministry is using firefox or some other

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,649
software but we need to make it much

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,230
more useful like who is using it really

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,390
and what four can you describe a use

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,730
case in your own and in administration

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,649
what are the problems you have when you

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,690
tell your agents that you're going to

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:32,410
switch from this software to this other

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,370
software so we really want to take it

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:39,880
from a static document to your dynamic

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:44,260
website where we encourage mutualization

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,120
not of resources of codes but of

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,380
knowledge that we have on this software

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,949
and so i already mentioned this - it

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,970
hasn't representation so this is the

00:12:53,949 --> 00:13:01,240
open data access for france that i goo

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,120
that i'm sure i hope you know already if

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,459
you don't go there and try to reuse some

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,500
some data and to build new startups

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,079
sorry this is the idea behind that and

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,720
this has been a free software from the

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,220
beginning not just a free software it's

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,449
also commands me

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,399
meaning that it's been reused by other

00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:26,800
ministries at least two of them today

00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:30,029
and other countries like Serbia for

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,019
example is using it so we're not just

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,629
releasing the source code but we are

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,120
also trying to create a Commons so

00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:40,089
tackling the the hard topics of

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,730
governance and how to continue build a

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:47,680
roadmap together and and and and go on

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:50,230
like that a Teta lab we published a list

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,389
of the free software that we are working

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,949
on and sharing with the community

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,540
because sometimes you just work on

00:13:53,949 --> 00:14:00,310
something and you don't have the time to

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:02,439
market it so it's very cheap marketing

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,079
this is just a webpage but at least we

00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:06,459
have a link to point to when people ask

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,740
what are you doing what are you

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:11,019
developing what if I'm a citizen I want

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,029
to contribute to what the public sector

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,670
is doing can I contribute to a talib

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:18,459
software yes you can this is here and we

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,889
get all the explanations and we also try

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,860
to be transparent on what we are using

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:26,259
as I said the catalog of free software

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,689
of recommending free software is just a

00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:32,290
static PDF right now which is good but

00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:35,949
we can go further and describe what

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:39,610
we're using in details so if some other

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:42,610
organization see that we are using for

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:46,269
example motto MOOC am a term up for for

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,069
statistics then they might ask us how do

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,639
you use it is it really useful how do

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:55,120
you switch from proprietary solutions to

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,189
this free software solution as an

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,230
example of collaboration of kind of

00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,870
random collaboration but successful

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:07,319
collaboration we recently published all

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:12,839
the data about real estate exchanges and

00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:16,149
it was just a web application are shiny

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,550
web application and then some guy came

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,290
and helped us so and this was just a

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,540
very small collaboration between the

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,120
developer at a table at a lab is like 20

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,540
patients right so and half of them are

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,840
developers and just very small team but

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,960
with

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,560
then encourages small collaborations and

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,530
I cannot insist enough on how this is

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,920
important to not miss small

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,720
opportunities which is not the

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,150
mainstream ID in the administration

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,640
rights you have obligations and you

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,340
don't always pay attention to every

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,470
email so we do that we try to do that

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,590
and to spread this kind of culture that

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,860
we have in a successful successful open

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:02,350
source project I can go very fast for

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,460
the rest because I am running out of

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,980
time this is the list of entrepreneur

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,830
general project with the source code

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,020
here and some data that we publish this

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,680
is the list of suit this is where you

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,000
find the source code of all the 75

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,540
startups so if you want to contribute to

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,030
one of the public service that is that

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,600
is built at Danzig you can go there and

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:31,600
and and find some team you want to

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,880
interact with this is an example of a

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,210
public service another one we just

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,810
yesterday won the an award by the

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:43,900
European Commission on this one this is

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,510
open fisca and i like to explore this

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,090
this is the list of organizations public

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,550
agencies organizations that aren't

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,590
github and we also want to have the ones

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,690
on github and harvest all the

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:59,770
repositories and to build this search

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,410
engine and we even were able to start

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,900
some analysis and on the number of

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,540
commits by the public sector this is the

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,810
HTML version of the catalogue free

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,090
software catalog but you can refer to

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:16,209
this is the guide about public sector

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:19,270
algorithm and the example of what it

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:22,120
looks like for paco soup so this is also

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,370
an effort of transparency and as a

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,150
citizen you can give feedback on this

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:32,200
and we are going to reply to every email

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:35,200
tap is the whatsapp replacement for

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,450
civil agents so it made the news

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,490
recently because a hacker found the

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,680
vulnerable vulnerabilities quite quickly

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,980
and then we were able to react and then

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,679
to

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,179
find out that it was not really chapped

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,370
but some utilities in Python and so on

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:54,160
blue hats this community it does exist

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,919
these are real people I can see some of

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,690
them here they don't have their blue

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:03,120
heads but I don't so I can obtain them

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:07,390
and just as a community we continue to

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,130
discuss with each other and to meet in

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:14,880
hackathon so this one is happening in

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,880
October and I can encourage you to come

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:20,580
go there to subscribe to the newsletter

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,110
that we have on blue hats

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,669
well next step is to build this sir

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,669
changing and we are going to use

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:31,230
something published by Italy that is

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:34,080
metadata for public sector source code I

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:38,040
would like to say a word about diversity

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:42,549
because don't see many women here and

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,799
developers so it's a shame and I think

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:47,110
this is somewhere something that the

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,160
public sector can be better at the

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:54,460
Dundee industry because we have rules on

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,010
recruiting on hiring and we are pushing

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,490
this at least at the Danzig very much so

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:03,549
these are website of the give you to

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:10,360
encourage this enquiry small diversity

00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm going to finish very quickly yeah

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,820
