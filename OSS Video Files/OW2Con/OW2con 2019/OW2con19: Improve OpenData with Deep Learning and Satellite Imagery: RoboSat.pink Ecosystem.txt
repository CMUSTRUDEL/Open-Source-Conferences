Description: 
	Quality of OpenData is for sure an issue, and among them all location based data.

On the other hand, we gather nowadays more and more data from remote sensing, and we are talking here in PetaBytes.

So, how can we use efficiently several kind of data, by fusion, to extract and spot meaningful insights ?

Deep Learning is for sure a good candidate, and RoboSat.pink is a dedicated ecosystem providing Semantic Segmentation for geospatial imagery.
