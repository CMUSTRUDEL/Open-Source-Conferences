Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	The CROSSMINER project is open source project which basically focus on increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. The project is forked from a previous project called OSSMETER. The complexity and diversity of its legacy components raised challenges related to the integration and the communications between the build-in components and security aspects for the whole project. In this context, we would present how we used the Microservice techniques with docker to perform an integration and deployment of these heterogeneous legacy components.
