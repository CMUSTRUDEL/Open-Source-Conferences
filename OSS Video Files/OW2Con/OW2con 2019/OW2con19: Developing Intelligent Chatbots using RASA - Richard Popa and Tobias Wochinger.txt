first of all I'm very happy to be here

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,170
to meet all of you at this conference

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,940
it's great to speak about challenging

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,109
projects we do with our childhoods in

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,119
Orange

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,279
I'm Richard I work for Orange I have

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,400
been working for Orange since 20 years

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,920
now and today I'm with Toby especially

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,840
came from Berlin yesterday for this

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,779
conference thank you a lot in order to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,820
talk about our partnership

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,350
I work for our orange friends for the

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,230
b2c Department we are building chat BOTS

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,640
for our customers for question and

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:48,660
answers for emergency questions we have

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,579
also a chat bots for customer self-care

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,370
we have also commercial

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,660
conversational on Commerce so we are we

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,039
have a lot of chat BOTS who are

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,650
developing and before starting

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,060
developing our chat BOTS we said okay

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:12,000
maybe we need to build a middleware so

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,640
this is how bahtman came to life boatman

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,850
is not a chatot is a framework an

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,299
Orchestrator what we wanted to achieve

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,640
with boatman is to not to be dependent

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,189
of the any new provider of the

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,119
artificial intelligence providers we

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,770
wanted to have a single entry point in

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,710
order to allow the user to switch

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,840
between the chat bots and also to talk

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,180
to a human without changing the

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,420
interface this was very important for us

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,909
and also to control the user interface

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:50,250
we are proposing to the to the customers

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:53,549
you know all gdpr so we wanted to take

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,299
the control over the data we send on the

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:00,509
cloud to manage the security to the

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,430
access to the chat bot and let's last

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,750
but not the least important is to

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,550
facilitate the training of our chat bots

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,730
we store all the logs all the

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,569
conversation logs and we are able to

00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,079
review it

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:22,730
also to send them to our business owners

00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:22,730
to see if they need to change our charts

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:33,209
here is a little demonstration of our

00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:35,879
platform so we say we don't have

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,389
internet then jingo the name of our

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:45,409
childhood is answering we can show

00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:45,409
images we can have quick reply buttons

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:54,750
so this is what our platform looks like

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:57,659
when we build a chat bot we have three

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,099
parts we have the user interface we have

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,219
the orchestrator we have the artificial

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,949
intelligence part so bahtman address is

00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,769
the two parts the first two parts so

00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:11,400
when we build a new project we don't

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:14,489
have to handle the first two parts but

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,169
one will take it in care of this and for

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,519
the most of the chadwell's who used Raza

00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,759
we are very proud that boatmen was

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,479
developed using 100% open-source

00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,569
technologies we use Java we use

00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,280
angularjs Redis RabbitMQ MongoDB docker

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:38,729
and of course Raza

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,349
everything is done in the verbs cool

00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:41,519
yeah thanks a lot for having me here I'm

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,859
Tobias from Raza

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,799
so yeah what do I be doing a draw is

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:49,109
actually so our vision is it to build a

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,669
assistance the drug for everyone so you

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,229
don't have to be a data scientist you

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,970
don't have to be your senior engineer we

00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,340
want to make it as easy as possible for

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,530
everyone to actually build chat pods

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,419
which you can then put in production and

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,769
by that we want to become the standard

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,229
infrastructure layer for

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,290
conversationally I on the world wide web

00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,810
and yeah how are we doing that Richard

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,900
mentioned your open source so that's our

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,419
key value so everybody can download our

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,870
software can use it can customize it can

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,549
hack it can contribute new features can

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,830
also fix features it's available for

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,510
everyone and you can also integrate it

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,950
in your companies because you can just

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,720
like everything is transparent

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,910
you can use all the available end points

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,430
or if you need any custom components you

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,110
can just build them the other thing is

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,820
what we're using people of the standard

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,410
infrastructure layer is our community

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,110
since you're open-source we have a

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,900
community worldwide in the US and India

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,670
in Germany in France all over the world

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,640
and this community is actively like

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,800
engaging in the on our product meaning

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,870
they're writing blog posts so how to use

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,450
rather how to build cool chat BOTS with

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,640
Raza also contributing new features

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,400
doing feature requests for example and

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,370
this really helps us to boost Raza and

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,470
then obviously some natural language

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,500
processing is quite a difficult topic

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,800
and I and there's yeah already a lot of

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,540
been done but also it's a lot to improve

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,430
yeah and that's why applied research is

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,780
really important for us to push the

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,940
boundaries and not just to rely on

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,130
bigger companies to make actually

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,820
progress but actually to make progress

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,900
ourselves and and boosting NLP to make

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,700
further progress yeah we are quite a

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,710
young company so about two and a half to

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,290
three years old but we already came a

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,790
long way so we got like fortune 500

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,030
customers all over the world and

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,580
different branches and yeah sections

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,060
they're working in obviously like

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,530
healthcare and insurance or yeah for

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,120
them Roz is very good case they don't

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,120
have to send their custom or their

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,400
customer data to any cloud providers for

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,100
example you don't want to send sensitive

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,590
health theta or credit card numbers to

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,960
Google or Microsoft and so on so that's

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,730
why they really like they can use Raza

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,000
and they own the data and the control

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,350
the data and they also have all the

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,450
training data they know what's going on

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,000
it's their knowledge and that's what

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,310
they yeah with what's very good for them

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,570
and obviously we also have customers in

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,980
other branches such as orange yeah

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,630
and yeah well Roz is like recently

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,660
picked up a lot of speed in in

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,600
distribution to be over 500,000

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,880
downloads now from this different users

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,430
worldwide and we also got a forum where

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,949
our community comes together discussed

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,930
this Raza topics helping each other out

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,729
with features they want to have

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,830
implemented also if they have questions

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,069
they are helping each out each other

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,279
but we also on the forum trying to help

00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:56,199
our community enable them to build great

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,460
BOTS yeah let me quickly explain how

00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,289
Raza actually works

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm sorry Utley also maybe like have a

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,580
like a graph understanding what's

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,620
actually happening behind the scenes so

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,129
we roughly like split rather than two

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,650
parts in core Raza core is responsible

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,750
for the dialogue management so this is

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,729
the part which decides okay this is the

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,069
history of the conversation that's the

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,050
actual context of this conversation what

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,870
does this meet message of the user mean

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,680
in a certain context and then we also

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,150
got NLU

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,460
and it used responsible for actually

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,379
classifying the messages so actually

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,930
saying okay what does this message mean

00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,240
and if you have want to have a concrete

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,159
example for chancla bot could asks you

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,620
like would you like to have a medium or

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,689
a large pizza and then a user says I

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,240
want to have a large pizza and then the

00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,729
first component which kind of jumps in

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,889
is Raza and LU and classifying this

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,599
message so saying okay this message from

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,699
the user means they want to order a

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,310
pizza and apparently it should be a

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,219
large pizza pizza so it has this entity

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,589
large and then this message this

00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:01,899
classified message goes into rouser call

00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,750
and rather core actually looks in the

00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,550
history of the conversation okay so what

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,680
was the conversation until this point

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,539
what's the current context and what does

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,639
this message mean in this context and

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,520
based on this information it actually

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,069
then asks the user okay do you want any

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,990
extra toppings on the pizza and I have

00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,270
all the other information basically and

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,699
during this process you can integrate

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,819
all you databases and whatever you have

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,680
in terrassa you can like we support a

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,899
lot of things out of the box and but you

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,169
can also always customize everything to

00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:38,979
make it fitting into your existing yeah

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:42,279
infrastructure components yeah 21st of

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,769
May we actually brought made the next

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,260
step with Raza so our business model is

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,149
like short explanation that we got the

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,550
open source part which everybody can use

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,360
for free which is more developer

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,430
orientated

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,740
and then we got an enterprise product

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,720
but after why we saw well there's so

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,459
many features in this enterprise product

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,050
actually everybody needs some right

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,390
actually like going through the

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,850
conversations of your users annotating

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,250
new data yeah checking if there are any

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,490
bugs working collaborating on your part

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,579
as a team so we decided yet you made

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,200
make large parts of Raza blood from the

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,930
old enterprise products available for

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,420
free as the new name Raza X community

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,850
and you can just download it play around

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,709
with it and actually like yeah work

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,899
together on your part iterate on it

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,750
together having this UI which makes it

00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,730
even easier to work on the bot and which

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,850
makes it also easier for non-technical

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:39,490
people to actually work on that and yeah

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,890
that's a next step and yet just go to

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,060
our website Raza calm and download it if

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,620
you want to play around with it

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,050
but you always can also use the

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,050
open-source part if you want to do that

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:58,209
we are building the open innovation with

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,490
Raza what what I mean when I say so that

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:03,339
we are we have three axes we want to

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,620
develop our skills rapidly so we need

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:08,320
the editor to be an accelerator for

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,899
Orange in order to acquire all the

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,860
competencies we have weekly meetings

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,680
with Raza

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,649
we have also audited the the audit our

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,850
chatbots before going live and also we

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:23,620
can provide them some useful information

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,420
yeah and by having this check-ins every

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,800
week and seeing actually how users

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,199
develop the chat pods we got this

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,180
instant feedback loops right we see like

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,829
okay that's how we want people to use

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,110
our product and this is how actually

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,420
real-life customers and community

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,100
members are using our product and then

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,079
we instantly see okay this is working

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,240
better this is working well these are

00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,190
things we have to improve and this

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,140
instant feedback loop like having these

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,899
weekly check-ins getting an instant

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,640
feedback is yeah super helpful for us to

00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,430
actually improve this product and to

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,610
take it one step further what we are

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,860
also doing is that we have a specialized

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,890
support line we have quick bug

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,630
correction when I put here 48 hours is

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,560
the maximum to have a correction for

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,570
every bug

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,580
yesterday we had a workshop with Tobias

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,230
he's laughing because we found we

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,779
discovered two bugs in the product and

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,190
we had the correction right away in the

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,310
github it was published so it was

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,470
brilliant for example another example

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,779
was when we moved from present to to

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,480
present three we had a buck was

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,170
corrected under twenty four hours it's

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,750
very important for us to have to see

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,650
that the reaction of the editor is is

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,410
very quick very easy to cut to deal with

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,540
the support and also we share a wish

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,029
list this is very important for us you

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,490
know in this partnership because we have

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,520
the product but we also want to

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,140
contribute to the product with our

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,360
functionalities what what we would like

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,580
to see in the product what's missing

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,460
what is our point of view as a client

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,830
and this is very I think valuable for

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,250
for the editor for example the last item

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,380
we saw that is that in rasa ex that we

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,180
can annotate the conversations ok but we

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,010
would like to have also a comment in

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,490
order to say ok this conversation must

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:16,080
be review but why so this is kind of a

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,700
wishlist we share with with Rosa

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,650
yeah drugs we obviously also have a road

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,050
map like features you want to implement

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,380
like things very a vision where we see

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,240
the product going but as it often is I'm

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,760
users are using your product differently

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,770
right they for example orange you're

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,360
actually using our product in real life

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,520
conditions they're actually having a

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,830
thousands like people speaking to the

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,750
bot running rasa at scale and they have

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,390
totally different problems than we often

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,830
could expect that's really valuable for

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,140
us to get the input and actually see you

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,000
well we have this nice vision but maybe

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,440
we actually have to add this to actually

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,500
make it make it work in real life

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,600
case like our roadmap and might be like

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,580
yeah too far away or like missing

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,380
something there and also yesterday

00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,050
during the workshop it's just

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,420
interesting to see how others are using

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,790
your product just having this instant

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,279
yeah like kind of like a user test but

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,080
like a very advanced user test case our

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,570
user orange is actually running it at

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,150
scale right so it's also interesting to

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,860
see how to use it and then also see what

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,950
they build around and tools like what

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,810
they customized

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,090
how we can actually integrate in our

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,620
product so that's very important for us

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:29,270
to get these real-life product

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,850
requirements into our product I think

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,330
everything is said we are building this

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,400
partnership this win-win partnership for

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,550
this open innovation Thank You Tobias

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,920
and don't forget to to pass to see our

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,810
demo booth before going to lunch or

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,300
during the lunch we are here in the hole

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,290
thank you

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,290
