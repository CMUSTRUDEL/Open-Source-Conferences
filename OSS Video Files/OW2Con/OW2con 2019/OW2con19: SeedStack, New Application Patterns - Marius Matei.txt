Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	The design of cloud information systems requires usage of cloud ready development frameworks like SeedStack. SeedStack coding approach comes with some major benefits: compliance with open source cloud standards, modular design and clean code. Using domain driven design and bounded context concept, the microservices are finely identified. Operational elements like performance measures, APIs for connecting ressources are provided by SeedStack in order to prepare the integration of a cloud ready application with the host. SeedStack project templates and automation accelerate the development of cloud ready microservices. This presentation shows recent updates of SeedStack for building and operating modern architectures (microservices, Kafka, containers).
