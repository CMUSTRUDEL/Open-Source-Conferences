Description: 
	FaSilET² is an Open Source really end to end testing solution. End to end means it can input data on a UI, check that the UI is modified according to certain rules and also check that the data modification led to a database field modification, a new line in a log file, a mail sent, and so on.
This solution is based on Perl scripts with a high abstraction level, thanks to Perl modules, so almost every developper or tester can write testing scripts.
Another key point is that FaSilET² can check the whole project, including logs, mails, databases, etc. All tests are made in real-life situation without modifying anything on servers. Only SSH access is required.
FaSilET² uses "actuators" to simulate users input and checking results on UI and "validators" to check logs, databases, etc. on local or remote servers.
FaSilET² uses LXC containers to start validators in parallel of actuators scripts so they don't interfer.
Some metrology modules can also be used to check CPU, RAM, disk space, etc. on servers while running tests.
