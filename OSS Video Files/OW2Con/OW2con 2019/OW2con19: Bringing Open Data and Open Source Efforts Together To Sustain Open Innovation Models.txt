Title: OW2con19: Bringing Open Data and Open Source Efforts Together To Sustain Open Innovation Models
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	Profoundly influenced by the research communities, Open Data has originally been developed as an extension of Open Source culture. Both are consequences of the digital transformation and are based on similar values : openness, transparency and collaboration. However, the Open Data movement emancipated itself from Open Source as the economical and politic dimensions increased. Both movements as specificites even if the share a lot of similarities regarding development model and valorization, and have to address the same issues concerning licenses and sustainability projects. This talk will identify and analyse some links between these movements in order to sustain Open Innovation models.

hello again so as I said this

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,969
presentation at the beginning should

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,449
have been done by a colleague of mine

00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:21,660
who is LOC SM who works mainly on open

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,510
data topics so she couldn't attend I'm

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,980
going to replace and to just to share

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,470
our global and common thinking about how

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,890
to combine open data and open source

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,250
models in order to sustain a more open

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:49,190
innovation models that work at all so

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:54,180
first of all open source is just started

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:57,870
writing it's the very I would say match

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,020
view models who which which inspire new

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,430
new models on open data and open

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,890
hardware and open contents all of them

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,549
are thinking I would say by the same

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:16,770
people and from the my most most of them

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,470
are American guy guys and girls and all

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,930
of them thought about how can we have an

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,780
open approach we're getting content

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,479
we're getting data we're getting

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:31,280
hardware in the same way as there is

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:35,460
easy foods years before about software

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,240
so the first point and for each of these

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,710
movements we we have some IP rights

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,530
behind all of those topics and for each

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,380
of those moments IP rights are used in

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:55,130
order to help people to collaborate

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:59,040
that's I think maybe one of the main

00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:02,960
model of open source is using IP rights

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,930
in order to combine innovative and

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:13,170
inspiring collaboration the between or

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,920
all kind of actors so when we when with

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,300
me

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,720
we see about when we have a look about

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,690
soup and data first of first of all I

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,950
would say at the beginning of open data

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,380
lots of open open source activists say

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,080
okay we we've done lots of things

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,150
regarding software from years and we are

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,480
doing we are going to do the same we're

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,989
getting data but it's not a sign to to

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,650
share and to collaborate on software and

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:46,800
to share and collaborate on software

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,800
it's not the same because we we have

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,330
different business models behind sharing

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,120
data behind using it we have different

00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,090
it's different I would say organization

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,540
and actors who which are working on both

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,420
open source and open data and we have

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,050
also different natural asset or we have

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,890
when we are speaking about data a very

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,440
huge place of platform platforms and

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,030
network and Mass Effect's if you want to

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,370
combine the lots of different data both

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,100
both sectors when you are regarding open

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,160
source and open data or I would say

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,190
difference a lots of people which are

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,610
doing open source don't want to share

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,430
that data I I would say so they may be

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,850
the first examples are Google or

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,430
Facebook

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,709
we we spoke about this organization they

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,000
are sharing a lots of software but they

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,620
don't want to share any piece of data

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,110
and yes because their economic their

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,780
business model is based is based on its

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,209
it's based on the IDs they don't want to

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,070
share a data they want to collect lots

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,989
of data and they want to share

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,870
technologies I want to share software in

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,709
order to to have their value based on

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:13,290
the data they're owned by them at the

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:15,660
same time open data is a list of lots of

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,419
open data projects are not using open

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,479
source software when you just have a

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,570
look on so all of the open data platform

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,340
which are used by

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,270
collectivities or look at administration

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,220
in France

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,130
you see that I think 90% of them or

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:39,180
proprietary software because they it's

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,410
it's really hard for them it's a big

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:50,449
change to share data it's a very huge

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:53,130
and continuous work to just to to do a

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,570
new to share that at you to add a

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,800
collaborative approach for getting data

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,540
so there are not doing applesauce not

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,990
because they don't want to do it but

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,760
because it's not the main I would say

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:12,330
may know the first point is they need to

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:16,919
work on at the same time we have other

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:21,750
projects which show us sets we can try

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,690
to do bus an example I like is material

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,320
location service Stampler for people who

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,690
used it few years ago which is some kind

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,570
of competitors to what I've done Google

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,710
in order to help people to localize with

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,570
a GPS on the phone smartphone this is

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,669
modular location service is really

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,400
interesting because yes they're using

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:48,510
open-source but all that has the word

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,410
corrected were corrected by by people

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,810
who decided to quote source jutsu to use

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,740
a phone all the day long in order to

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,289
give to Madeira what they didn't want to

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,150
gave to Google at the same time as they

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:07,020
want they wanted to do it because it was

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:10,650
for them is the best way to to walk on

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,110
the common and they were sharing the

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:18,030
same things regaining data and software

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:21,419
and the same another project which is

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:27,090
really cool is open foot facts I don't

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:29,550
know if you know them it's you use yes

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,180
in France yes in the world we speak

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,450
about UK you guys a company who which

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,120
are using open open data open put food

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,949
facts open foxtrax it's a community

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,940
which

00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:44,310
doing open-source software and

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,570
open-source status in order to L people

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,490
to share information about food another

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,190
topic which which is interesting another

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,539
example is software with edge I think

00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:00,060
everybody here knows em I hope so but

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,430
that's a very good example about sharing

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,830
data and sharing source code as a data

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,720
in order to add people to build new

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:12,900
solution based on this huge database

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:16,229
they work on and to finish at tours

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,810
example first one is initiatives is it

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:23,940
Arab it's a franchise installation are

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,729
helping a lot are doing a lots of open

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,949
source projects regaining a

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:31,530
transformation of the administration and

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:34,650
all of them are combining both open

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:38,610
source and open that approach we have

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:42,630
exactly the same when you you see about

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,720
f2 as to the French a French company who

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,180
which decided to to have a very

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,210
interesting open source approach the

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,630
last year the Co Co beer it's a new

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,120
chapter

00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,180
I don't know it's the right place to

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,570
speak about it in another foundation the

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,250
Linux version which is the LF energy

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,599
chapter a very interesting one because

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,090
he decided to work with all the other

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,520
factors all the rafters from the energy

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,889
sector to build new solution new

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,560
software and as some some of this

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:24,000
project are about data to and at the

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,500
same time the they founded open data

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,120
hazal energy array which is a platform

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:35,789
which gather data from all French actors

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,490
which are providing data about energy

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,589
energy and they've done the same the

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,510
same initiatives working data are

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:48,360
getting software and now they are trying

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:53,390
to doing things better together and to

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:56,820
to finish because I need to be fast but

00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:01,100
yesterday I think you had a talk at from

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,520
the dean's ik best angry and yes I think

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,890
what is interesting is that open data

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,620
yes it's based on lots of things we

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,870
think about regain irrigating software

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,170
and collaboration in software projects

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,329
but today open data is giving I would

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,720
say giving back to software a lots of

00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:26,150
things first and maybe the main one in

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,730
France is in the open web accumulates so

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,550
the low which are asking and miss public

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:36,180
and inspiration to share data they con

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,610
they consider that every software as a

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,130
data so when a public administration is

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,320
doing data is doing software they are

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,360
developing any software working with our

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,220
missions they need to share it to other

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,100
people and because they need to share it

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,839
they are thinking about how to hold can

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,630
they collaborate or again what they're

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,700
sharing with another administration or

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:03,570
regarding other private sector company

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:06,779
and we set that to French context but in

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,640
Europe regarding the public sector

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,250
information directive we are thinking

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,810
about how to you to do the same from

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:18,690
other countries in Europe so maybe maybe

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,320
in two or five or 10 years we will have

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,230
a stunner stunner

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:29,029
law in Europe asking all administration

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:33,209
from Europe to share cut and that's

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:36,750
thanks to open data and all the stuff

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:39,570
people the have done we're getting

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,420
sharing and transparent from pubic state

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,620
own information so that's I think a very

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,510
good

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:52,290
giving back from firms open data to to

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:55,400
open source those are the topics which

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,280
are interesting to combine is how to

00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,750
sustainability how to combine what you

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,550
are doing or getting data and what you

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,170
are doing reckoning

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:08,240
software and how can say all of them can

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,320
work together in order to have a bit of

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,980
sustainability in open models and the

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,610
last the last thing I'm sharing is about

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,240
yes sharing value how can we in both

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,360
open data community and button software

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,510
community how can we work on as the best

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,860
way to share value between maintenance

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,860
people which are doing those work and

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,310
other actors which are helping the

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:43,220
project by saying that's exactly what it

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:46,130
was said just before me and how can we

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,560
find it's a good way to to sharing value

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,220
between all of those actors and we have

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,570
exactly the same in both sectors so yes

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,929
it's an end thank you very much

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,929
