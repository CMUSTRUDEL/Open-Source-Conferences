Title: OW2con19: Open Source UX: Duty to Rescue - Nicolas Vérité
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	We are going to focus on user experiences of instant messaging throughout different technological revolutions of the last two decades. The result is quite mediocre, and we are all aware of it, although the ground is highly favorable for innovation and the big bazaar of user testing. Let's find out what's not working, and propose some solutions.

[Music]

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:15,150
first I'm sorry about my voice I lost it

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,010
somewhere so if you find it I'm gonna be

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,330
glad and if because of this voice this

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,830
presentation is boring

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,510
please stay because there's peer

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,240
afterwards and it's going to show you

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,939
something awesome second thing I'm sorry

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:35,820
I haven't finished my t-shirt I'm gonna

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:38,670
finish it tomorrow okay so I'm here to

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,950
talk about open source UX the UX is user

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,800
experience you know that right okay so

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,390
I'm gonna talk not about the whole open

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,129
source user experience but I'm gonna

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,890
focus on I am instant messaging or chat

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:58,199
because that's what I know how to do and

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,820
second thing this is a different

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,460
presentation because it's not going to

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,650
be that technical I'm gonna be you

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,799
removing all the technical parts so that

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,909
we can focus on the use and the social

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,040
impact of everything okay now spoiler

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,640
warning this is the end of my

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,590
presentation my conclusion is we can do

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,330
better we agree on that

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,820
okay thank you I am Nicola as a joint

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,329
release me Nicole ability I used to be

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,820
the president of in xf4 I'm not only I'm

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,939
only vice president now but I co-founded

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,890
now you go and I am member of the board

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,439
of directors of the exercise which is

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,450
the XMPP stylist Foundation jabber if

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:51,990
you know it in that way this is okay

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,970
I love pauses so I said this

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,780
presentation would be different

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,770
I won't I'm not going to your intellect

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,420
now I want you to focus on your memory

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,970
of what's following and the feeling

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,899
associated with it okay I'm gonna show

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,000
you a series of pictures

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,720
you're gonna think about it when you

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,540
used these things and remind the feeling

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,489
you had with it okay

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:30,459
let's start with this first object so

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:34,569
what is it what is it our phone remember

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:37,750
the noise 3d model of the phone that's

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,579
funny I love it so remember this sound

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:44,049
remember how you compose the number

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:45,970
right well it's not usable these days I

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:50,409
mean you show that to a kid either

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,269
he says what that what what LF so but

00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:54,250
this was a revolution because you can

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,439
phone your friends and family without

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,079
moving without sending a postcard this

00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:04,510
was a revolution now let's think about

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:06,310
the next revolution Wow and you French

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,150
people are proud of that because we had

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,859
internet before the world had it ok

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:18,129
remember the speed remember the graphics

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:23,530
the awesome graphics of it ok next

00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:26,829
object is this one wonderful design that

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,530
was a computer that's a x86 computer

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,769
right you can see that it's bad all over

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,290
the place 14 inches CRT or rounded

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,260
corners everything even the mouse is not

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,150
the same color and maybe you can spot an

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,620
error here you have the cd-rom player

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,620
but not the speakers so this was awesome

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:54,819
you had this at home you can play with

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:56,409
DOS 6 - awesome and then ah you will do

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:01,979
something for the next picture ok you

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,979
will do the sound of it ok all together

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:19,139
and associated with it the fear that it

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,419
would not connect but this was a

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,979
revolution we could connect the computer

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,850
isolated computer that the whole

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,729
Internet

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:35,010
awesome awesome and then I'm gonna stop

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:36,900
here so I want to make an apology once

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,539
again to the organizers as Christians

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,380
Jean you trusted me on that and what I'm

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,600
gonna show you is absolute violence okay

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,669
so I want the sensible minds to get out

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,940
of the room right now if it is your

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,800
nation's because this is highly violent

00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:05,460
okay

00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:10,590
take a deep breath because was that but

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:14,550
you know what it is about its ICQ okay

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:19,020
proprietary software sorry yeah used it

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:21,630
right okay wonderful webpage with tables

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,740
not is not CSS it's rather didn't exist

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,160
at that time can you see the broken

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,389
pictures at the top yeah

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,669
reminder very first thing okay this is

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,639
absolute order now but at that time that

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,250
was a revolution once again so let's

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,340
take another look at another violent

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,789
picture which is ICQ itself another

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,340
webpage it looked like that but that's

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,599
crap onyx honestly you don't use that

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,580
kind of software anymore

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,870
but at that time that was a revolution

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:56,910
okay reminder you use these to connect

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,520
with ICQ so you picked up the phone you

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,120
used it for a quarter of an hour and you

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,120
were online so you had to tell all your

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,430
friends that you were online okay so you

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,990
had to go fast that's what we changed

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,490
the naming of chat we used the term the

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,789
expression instant message

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,440
okay it changed everything so here are

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,960
the players at that time ICQ were the

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,120
first and then others others at the

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,860
others and what you can see is at the

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,330
top and this side which is the right you

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,610
have the propriety resistance all

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,340
incompatible and here you have the

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,110
jabber software that was called gerra at

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,270
that time and all of these were

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,440
compatible what you can see is the split

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,720
is 50/50 so we the open source player

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,229
were good at that time we're on the

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,509
market and we're competing 5050 that's

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,669
great that's what we call the first

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,150
generation of I am now let's jump onto

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,650
the second generation of I am so I told

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,660
you what changed everything was the

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,509
modem do you know what changed

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,430
everything again so that it gave birth

00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,900
to the second generation of I am what's

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:13,050
the hardware revolution exactly show it

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,759
this so the smartphone the multi-touch

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,169
smartphone that was a revolution it's

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,509
not only about the iPhone it's also

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,340
about Android so remember at that time

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:25,110
we had this kind of phone these were the

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:30,180
best ok so now the revolution came from

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:33,030
whatsapp what's up used this device to

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,699
deliver a user experience that was

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,840
completely different everything on the

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,520
smartphone remember we used to connect

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,009
exceptionally to the Internet now we

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,050
disconnect exceptionally we have

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:48,810
internet in the pocket at all time

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,500
so this changed everything now let's

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,680
take a look at the players now around 20

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,349
opens proprietary barriers if not more

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,190
and a few of them on the open source

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,320
sign and I need to speed up so do you

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:11,909
know what is their hardware revolution

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:13,770
of the third generation of I am this no

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,470
hardware revolution you know what's that

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,040
these are the key players

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,620
slack now when you take a look at the

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,900
players in third generation of I am in

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,510
team chat or proprietary there is sixty

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,960
of them but none on XMPP that's a

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,570
problem

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,849
so we're shrunk the you know the players

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:38,909
completely Frank so we have a problem

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:41,640
here we don't follow up the world so is

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,440
open source an opportunity for UX is UX

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,230
an opportunity for reference host yes of

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,450
course so I propose you two solutions

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,200
one solution is a culture one is a

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:57,240
product a use case so one is focusing on

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,980
how the open source does UX and the

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,230
other one is a product that's an IM

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,840
product is now you know so the first one

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,780
is experience hacking so how do you

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:11,340
fusion the developers mindset and the UX

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,100
mindset that's it so it's like DevOps is

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,990
fusion in scissored min with dev more or

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,800
less it's like rule of hacking is fusion

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,080
in cells and developer more or less so

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,250
what is it about it's about developers

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,910
going do user tests observe the people

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,440
not stick to their opinions is how it's

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,940
about listening to people it's about

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,590
observing what they do it's about

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,290
understanding what they don't understand

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,910
on your software and on the UX mind it's

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,470
about you know the culture of sharing

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,990
the culture of open source licenses okay

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,950
now what we've done is do that on an

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:53,100
open source project and we did user

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,530
tests we made the problems obvious to

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,000
the whole community and now they are

00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,310
okay with it we have to deal with the

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,770
problem so we ideated many solutions we

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,620
tested them and then we are going to be

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,370
delivering these improvements which are

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,440
quite awesome

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,440
now the first use case we are going

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,830
forward with now you go what we want to

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,440
do is hack not an existing open source

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,380
software the it's experience but we want

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,720
to hack the third generation of I am we

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,089
want to hack slack not modify slack but

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,980
to better than it okay so the first

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,290
thing we did is observe the people ask

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,310
questions and open up our minds to the

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,050
problems

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:37,439
so we spotted the problems first slack

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,629
and all the team chats are silos you are

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,240
trapped in a workspace it's not

00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,720
compatible it's not interoperable like a

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,290
second problem notification overload you

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,279
are interrupted all day long third

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:55,110
problem well chat is chaotic since its

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,879
beginning right you can have parallel

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,870
conversation within the same

00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:04,769
conversation so we're solving that all

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,949
these so this led leads us to the fourth

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,920
maybe generation of chat so one example

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:13,579
of our innovation is that we are

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,819
structuring the conversation through a

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:20,639
visual addition a visual overlay we make

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:24,600
the discussions obvious to the people to

00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,790
the human eye so we believe that it

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,189
improves the structure reduces the

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:34,740
misinterpretation and allow people to

00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:37,490
move forward faster please come to me we

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,769
can discuss how you can improve your

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,629
software through experience hacking user

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,879
tests etc and if you want to see the

00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:48,820
first Yusuke test now you go I'm gonna

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,559
do a demo for you thank you

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,559
