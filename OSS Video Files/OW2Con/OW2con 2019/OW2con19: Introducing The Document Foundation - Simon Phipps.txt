Title: OW2con19: Introducing The Document Foundation - Simon Phipps
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	One of OW2's newest Affiliate organisations, The Document Foundation is a global charity based in Germany that works to promote open source productivity tools. Its flagship project, LibreOffice, is available across major desktop platforms and continues the fourth decade of impact for the code that started life as Star Writer on CP/M.
TDF's governance draws from the best examples in the open source free software community and has attracted exceptional levels of contribution for the projects it hosts, LibreOffice and the Document Liberation Project. The Foundation is funded predominantly by public donations and now has a capable staff serving its community. TDF works to maintain balance between its software freedom mission and the commercial needs of its community members.
Once member, Collabora Productivity, has ported LibreOffice to the cloud, creating LibreOffice Online and seeding a new community and market opportunity in which OW2 members can participate.
This presentation will expand on all these themes and more.
