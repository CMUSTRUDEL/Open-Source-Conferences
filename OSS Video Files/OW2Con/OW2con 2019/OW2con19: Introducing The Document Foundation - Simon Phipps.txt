Title: OW2con19: Introducing The Document Foundation - Simon Phipps
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	One of OW2's newest Affiliate organisations, The Document Foundation is a global charity based in Germany that works to promote open source productivity tools. Its flagship project, LibreOffice, is available across major desktop platforms and continues the fourth decade of impact for the code that started life as Star Writer on CP/M.
TDF's governance draws from the best examples in the open source free software community and has attracted exceptional levels of contribution for the projects it hosts, LibreOffice and the Document Liberation Project. The Foundation is funded predominantly by public donations and now has a capable staff serving its community. TDF works to maintain balance between its software freedom mission and the commercial needs of its community members.
Once member, Collabora Productivity, has ported LibreOffice to the cloud, creating LibreOffice Online and seeding a new community and market opportunity in which OW2 members can participate.
This presentation will expand on all these themes and more.

	00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:14,759
so good morning I'm here to talk to you

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,890
about the document foundation so so I've

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,529
spoken here before and you've seen me

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,470
speak about oh s I hear before I'm also

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,460
the direct a director I'm also a

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,470
director of the document foundation now

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,070
the document foundation was formed about

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,290
a decade ago to be the home for the

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,260
community that had previously existed

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,250
around Sun Microsystems OpenOffice

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,640
project and since then it has it has

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,530
gone from strength to strength to I do a

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,969
number of other things as well I'm on

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,950
the board of the open rights group in

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,010
the UK I'm also on the board of the new

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,590
console democracy foundation which is a

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,620
foundation to produce participative

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,030
democracy software and I don't have a

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,930
job I don't work for anybody

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm funded by patreon donations and so

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,900
if you liked my presentation please go

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:15,509
to my patreon and support me the

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,030
principles for the the foundation first

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,619
of all some naming Libre Office is the

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,689
name of this software that I'm

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,850
presenting with at the moment this is a

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,490
free and open source office productivity

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,630
suite it's installed by millions of

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,060
users worldwide

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,729
we estimate there are about 200 million

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,460
users of this software and the

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,009
foundation is funded by donations from

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,500
those users so we have an income of

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,110
between three quarters and a million

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,079
euros a year which we receive in ten

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,869
euro donations from the users of the

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,579
software so this software is not funded

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,729
by any corporation it's funded by the

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,829
people who love it it's also a worldwide

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,829
community and you'll see more about that

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:05,009
in a minute but we have over 300

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,680
developers and we have people

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,440
contributing to the project in almost

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,970
every well populated country in the

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,870
world

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,810
it's all hosted by a German

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,170
driftin that's a capital anchored

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,090
foundation and the objective of the

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,220
foundation is the promotion and

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:29,500
development of office software available

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,599
for use by anyone as free software we

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,000
haven't put the name Libre Office in the

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,769
foundation and we did that on purpose we

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,920
wanted to make sure there could never be

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,530
a confusion between the stiff tongue and

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,340
the foundation and the and the software

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,609
our philosophy is to support the

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,769
development of both the software and a

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,079
community and a market around the

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,390
software so the reason I'm presenting to

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,959
you is I believe there is a valuable

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,349
business opportunity for you as owt to

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,629
members and member projects I believe

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,370
there is something new in libreoffice

00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,989
that may come as a surprise to you but

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,790
there's something new that there's a

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,909
business opportunity for you and that I

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,440
think you should look at so we're here

00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:20,500
to develop a community and a project and

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,079
we are independent of any particular

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,030
sponsor there is no company funding us

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,160
there is no company in control of us

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,829
there is no company the benefits

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,900
exclusively from the software so if you

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,849
join in with our community you're

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,010
guaranteed that your interests are going

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,609
to be protected along with everybody

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,250
else's

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,540
unlike many many open-source projects

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,849
today

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,750
we have very low barriers to entry if

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,459
you want to get started with LibreOffice

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,160
OpenOffice when we first embraced it a

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,470
decade ago was insanely complicated and

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,840
we decided that we would refactor it

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,599
that we would make it much more

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,819
accessible and today we have easy hacks

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,370
that you can use to get started to have

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,260
something worth compiling we have hack

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,699
fests in many countries including in

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,349
Paris we have students coming in through

00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,349
google Summer of Code we run workshops

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,120
and we consequently have a steady flow

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,609
of new developers coming into the

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,690
community we cooperate with many other

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:24,969
entities we are W 2's newest affiliate

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,389
and again that's the reason why I'm here

00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:32,949
at the conference this year we exist

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:36,009
by the community for the community about

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:39,250
the foundation foundations are for

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,720
eternity in Germany a stiff tongue the

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,580
idea of a stiff tongue if you're you

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,610
trained as a lawyer in Germany you get

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,190
told that a stiff tongue was created to

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,310
maintain Bismarck's grave for all

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,130
eternity a foundation is something that

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,979
that exists beyond the duration of the

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,960
founders beyond the lifecycle of the

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,630
founders beyond the lifetime of the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,090
founders and we've tried to design the

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,280
document foundation to be like that its

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,620
objectives can't be changed its

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,539
community is protected throughout you'll

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,449
see in a moment a complicated structure

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:15,580
the foundation itself acts as a trustee

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,250
for valuable elements such as trademarks

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,400
and domains but he's not part of the

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,979
commercial ecosystem itself and so it

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,070
will have to start another company if it

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,870
wants to do anything which is identified

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,880
as trading and by doing that we

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,180
guarantee the rights of all participants

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,699
in our community we're structured as an

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,400
elected board of directors that's

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,620
elected by a Board of Trustees that's

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,650
our members the members if you

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,800
contribute to the document foundations

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,479
projects for three months and you

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,130
promise us that you will continue

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,159
contributing for at least the next six

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,740
months you can be elected as a trustee

00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,750
and as a trustee you get to elect the

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,430
board of directors and also the

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,509
Membership Committee who will check your

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,460
application we also have an advisory

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:09,070
board and the advisory board is

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,039
comprised of companies involved in the

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,039
ecosystem if you start a project or a

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,960
product that uses a document foundation

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,539
project please join our advisory board

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,150
we would charge you for the privilege we

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:24,340
won't give you a vote but you will be

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,090
able to directly support the work of the

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:32,320
foundation which is the administrative

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:35,380
enabling work of the foundation and you

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,690
can read that in the slides later what

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,620
we do is public by default all of our

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,950
meetings are either open or guaranteed

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,750
to be

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,560
published after the confidential mad

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,870
subject matter has been completed and

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,410
all of our mailing lists are open

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,680
everything is scrupulously beyond the

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,450
control of individuals so now on about

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,800
projects the one of course that you've

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,720
heard of is Libra office Libra office

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,550
was the successor project to

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,850
openoffice.org after it was

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,720
unfortunately abused by an acquiring

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,270
company it is the leading free office

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,810
suite for Windows Linux and Mac OS and

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,000
we have widely used and mature products

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,400
for all of those platforms the one I'm

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,520
running here is the Linux version and

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,520
I'm running it on a Chromebook so what

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,010
you're seeing here is is the you know

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,840
the real software it's come a long way

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,550
since the last time you used it if you

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,240
don't use it and you really should go

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,500
check it out again it has a

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,520
significantly revised user and user

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,290
interface with a new tool book bar which

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,790
you can configure to be a ribbon

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,490
interface if you like that from

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,770
Microsoft you can also configure it to

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,720
be a tabbed interface you can also

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,360
configure it to be multiple sidebars

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,880
it's a very flexible user interface it's

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,650
available in 100 languages those

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,630
individual language projects are

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,890
maintained by local language products in

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,710
the country where the language is spoken

00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,120
and consequently the translation is more

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,490
accurate than the one that you will have

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,160
seen anywhere else

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,680
we have a time-based release mechanism

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,140
we do that so that there is no one in

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,640
control of the releases it's a release

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,200
train mechanism so if you make a

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,630
contribution you can be sure your

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,430
contribution will be in a release of the

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,430
product within six weeks of it being

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,950
accepted by the project and that means

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,080
that every new contributor is welcome

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,790
and every new contributor feels welcome

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,010
you don't have to wait for the god of

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,870
releases to decide that you shall be

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:45,850
blessed by inclusion in a future release

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,040
current version is Libre Office 6.3 is

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,750
in beta test please do give it a try

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,930
it's all licensed under but under the

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,970
Mozilla Public License version 2 and

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,180
that means you can easily include in

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,790
your

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,770
commercial product if you would like to

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,110
that's important for libreoffice online

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,110
you know libreoffice online is the same

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,480
code base as libreoffice but it has been

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,620
designed with weave it's a libreoffice

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,800
is designed on a model-view-controller

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:17,620
design and we constructed a new view and

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,860
also a new controller that allowed us to

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:28,300
do tiled rendering and i'll try and show

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:31,240
that to you there so libre office online

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,800
doesn't have a file manager it needs to

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,250
use some other file manager in the file

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,930
manager i'm using here is next cloud if

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,450
i click on the presentation that we're

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,300
looking at now it will open the same

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,880
file as we have just been looking at in

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,310
the presentation there it is

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,529
and that's exactly the same ODF file

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:55,690
that we were using before and we have a

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,839
subset of the editing capabilities of

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,750
the full product it's a growing subset

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:05,589
but this is a new user interface this is

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,630
not just the X Windows user interface

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:10,959
turned into a web page this is a

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,589
completely new user interface that you

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,440
talks to the libreoffice model which is

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:20,260
now running on a server somewhere and we

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,550
can i let's bravely try and do a full

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,529
screen presentation with that when i do

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,420
that what happens is this the slide

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,550
presentation is rendered into display

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,209
postscript on our server back in berlin

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:39,790
there it is and then i have the live

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:43,470
presentation in here which will

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,470
gradually build for me

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,700
okay we have another project which is

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,440
called the document liberation project

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,960
document liberation is a project to take

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,590
old file formats and proprietary file

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,350
formats work out how they work and then

00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:03,260
build a library that imports them and if

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,540
possible exports them from Libre Office

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,600
and the library format that we've chosen

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,400
is a standardized library format that's

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,610
used by many other free software

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,770
projects so if you have a file format

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,810
that you know all about or you have

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,080
sample documents for or preferably both

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,180
please contribute them to dlp when you

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,060
do that Libre Office will be able to

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,730
open those read those files but also so

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,140
link scape and so will many other free

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,350
software projects be able to access

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,290
those files document foundation hosts

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,970
this project as a shared resource for

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,890
the free software community to try and

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,010
make sure that no file is beyond the

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,380
reach of free software we also have a

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,390
standards project called Kazem that's

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,480
the community of ODF specification

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,820
maintainer z' unfortunately IBM pulled

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,190
out of open document formats a few years

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,040
ago and they had been paying the editor

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,810
of the specification and there was no

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,250
one there to take the work of the

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,870
Technical Committee and turn it into a

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,350
polished iso ready

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:10,460
specification so the document foundation

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,230
seeded the crowdfunding of a an editor

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,790
for the specification and that succeeded

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:18,290
well Microsoft kelabra CIB and the UK

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,050
government all contributed to that

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,910
crowdfunding and as a result we have ODF

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,910
1.3 coming out this summer

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:30,380
edited by Francis cave who's one of the

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,510
the best known file format standards

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,370
experts in the world if you'd like to

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,380
join in with this crowdfunding if you

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,730
value the existence of ODF for your

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,500
business or for the free software

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,839
community then please get in touch with

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,990
me we could do with some more donations

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:49,040
for ODF 1.4 which we plan for about 18

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,860
months time we write all this up in an

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,400
annual report is a really good annual

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,440
report

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,380
it's strange to recommend an annual

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,490
report to read but this is worth reading

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,020
the new at 2000

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,000
version is going to be out really soon

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,060
and we've started releasing the chapters

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,740
of it on our blog and you'll get a good

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,089
overview of what the foundation is doing

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,029
on what the individual projects are

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,800
doing in there we also have an annual

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,589
conference that we've run every year

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,920
it's run by a local group in one of our

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,740
member countries and this year it's an

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,390
almería in Spain and I very much

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,190
recommend that you come along it's a

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,190
very friendly conference you'll be very

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,779
welcome and people will be very pleased

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,810
to help you integrate Libre Office

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,610
online into your commercial offering I'd

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,279
encourage you to think about doing that

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,450
because not only is it commercially

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,089
valuable to do so it's also fun the best

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,520
way to use Libre Office online is to use

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,080
it as the viewer for something that

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,839
you're doing elsewhere in your

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,020
enterprise work when you do that the

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,149
file emitted by your work doesn't then

00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,029
need to be opened by excel or by

00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,860
Microsoft Office or by some other piece

00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,410
of proprietary software that these days

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,750
only exists to view the file that is

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,000
coming out of a web app and Libre Office

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,720
online can save you a huge amount of

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,760
money by eliminating the need for

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,470
Microsoft Office licenses for anyone but

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
people who create Microsoft Office

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,339
documents

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I'd suggest you take a look at it I'd be

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,750
very helpful very pleased to help you to

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,070
look at these things unfortunately the

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,980
workshop on how to do all that

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,630
integration was yesterday and so all the

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,610
people who would who did that or have

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,500
now all gone but we would be very

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,020
pleased to help you understand how you

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,540
can integrate Libre Office online into

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,790
your enterprise deployment or into your

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,500
commercial product so that you can

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,390
increase the value of your customers and

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,040
so that you can decrease the cost of

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,040
