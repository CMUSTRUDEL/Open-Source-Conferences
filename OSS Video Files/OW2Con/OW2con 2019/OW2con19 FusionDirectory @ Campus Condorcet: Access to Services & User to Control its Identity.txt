Title: OW2con19 FusionDirectory @ Campus Condorcet: Access to Services & User to Control its Identity
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	For once, this presentation  will not be technical but is placed at user level, process and use case for a variety of different populations.

Campus Condorcet, future campus of social sciences, will receive very different user populations and therefore will need transparent processes that can accommodate these populations in a transparent manner and respectful of the GDPR.

The challenge was to allow registration campaigns conducted by reference persons in institutions in a flexible and fast manner.

Then, it should also allow other audiences to obtain accounts for access to very large documentary equipment and other services that will appear throughout these years.

This conference will show how free software has made it possible to implement this IAM solution in a record time, create reusable processes while leaving ease and security at the heart of the system.

hello everybody I'm Bhanumati from open

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,650
sight we are specialized in Identity

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,369
Management so I will talk today about

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,289
something different that the other yes

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,680
not from a technical point of view but

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,340
from a functional point of view because

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,360
today more and more we are asked about

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,230
making nice and nice and complex from

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,870
the workflow how to help people putting

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,840
in place workflow for identity

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,710
management with some kind of delegation

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,410
and some other stuff so today I will

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,350
talk about the confuse Kondo say it's

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:57,510
the new scientific campus that will open

00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:02,430
at plan sunny this year and in this work

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,519
we have done the cell wall workflow so

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:09,540
what is the compute gonna say compute

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:14,460
color said is a new place for human and

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,960
social science it will have nearly

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,869
twenty thousand people coming around and

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,860
it's a bit special because it's people

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,430
that coming from various university 13/4

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,340
the start and this creates some

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,880
challenge because when you want to

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,990
manage the identity of those people on

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,119
your new campus as they come from other

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:46,290
university you don't want to create a

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,560
new identity management with all the

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,009
information you want to be able to get

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,610
the information from the university to

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,850
create your identity management but some

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,509
part of it only then you have note the

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,619
gdpr

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,290
and the GPR say that people own the data

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,319
of course the university already have

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,720
the data but if you want to transfer the

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,720
data from university of origin

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,900
to the new campus hey maybe you should

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,840
ask them huh I say maybe because if you

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,630
ask five people five people will have a

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,530
different answer but never less you have

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:32,920
to take that in mind and then what's

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,010
interesting and it goes with was Clement

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,650
let's talk about it was how can we use

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,440
the standard of the French National

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,430
Education and how can we use the

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,500
Federation system to be able to get this

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,380
info about the user and ask the

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,190
university of origin if this user can

00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:01,360
connect or not and then of course at

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,130
this campus for various people and you

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,130
don't know those people you then need

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,040
some kind of invitation system and

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,250
delegation system so people from the

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,420
university can then invite people who

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:20,650
are going to go to this countries so

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,459
respecting the GDP are as I say the user

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,820
own is data of course the university has

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,400
the data because people work there so

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,670
they need to have some kind of data but

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,950
then when you go through the Federation

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,400
and the data goes out of the university

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,910
the question is what should I do with

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,110
this

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,500
should I ask again to the user

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,400
please accept that I give your data to

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,730
the other entity and of course injera

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,670
did appear you need consent in farm

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,940
consent so it's not only I will give you

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,220
data its do you agree that I give the

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,420
data to the other people so there is a

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,830
big part on consent and in CompUSA it

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:15,400
was decided that in the process the user

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:19,090
will get his data from his university or

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,270
in through the Federation and then have

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,660
a box to click yes I agree that my data

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,660
should be transferred to nearly every

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,430
all

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,320
is done so walk flew ma that's an

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,620
interesting point because more and more

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,380
people are asking about workflow

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,220
workflow of management for the identity

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,960
management space and workflow it's lots

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,570
of thing to lots of different people

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,490
most of the time people tell you my

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,520
workflow it works that way and mind

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,970
works that way so it's kind of difficult

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,690
to make a basic workflow that works for

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,880
everyone met most of the time workflow

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,850
are already in place in the software is

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,150
just that the people asked for something

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,760
and I don't understand that it can be

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:16,100
done much more simpler that what they

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:19,190
want to do so in this case you see we

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,850
have what they call - it's people inside

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,120
the university that knows which people

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:30,530
should be invited to go to the campus

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,290
and then of course if you want people to

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,040
join the campus you have to way of doing

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:39,890
it making the - do all the work means

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,070
creating the account for the user but in

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,120
in this case we wanted the users to

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:50,150
create the account so the system sent

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,720
invitations and then user go through the

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,030
Federation connect with their item ID

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,130
from the University their password and

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:03,860
then it's free Phil sorry profile form

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:08,240
and then they can send it or corrected

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:11,860
and after they have been invited the -

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,230
can see in the interface of the software

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,330
confusion directory that does the

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:20,390
identity management if those people are

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,300
already accepted or not should and then

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,560
people get a message I'm an accepted I'm

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,780
not accepted and why this is in French

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,050
because I don't have one in English for

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:37,010
now but it shows you the system first

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:40,249
you have reference that has been

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:45,619
designed the - is doing the

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:48,049
mutation then then the half a hunt don't

00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:52,129
give it a shunned people get a mail

00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:54,979
click on the link get the farm

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:58,839
fill the form and then it's validated by

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:02,749
the referent and as soon as it's done

00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:06,319
you have a unique link between the user

00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:08,959
at the campus and his identity in this

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,919
university so each time it connects to

00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,539
the campus it goes through his identity

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,299
of origin through the Federation and

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:21,079
then we can validate inside the campus

00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:25,849
that this person has got the ability to

00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:28,299
connect to this kind of software this is

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,969
just to show the data collected at

00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:35,869
registration as you can see some market

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:38,269
import so all the import a are done

00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:40,879
through the Federation so the user

00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:46,189
doesn't have to fill those one and then

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:48,829
it can add some specific information why

00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:53,479
we are doing that it's because the in

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:56,809
the Federation system you can just say I

00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:00,409
will only send this kind of information

00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:04,489
and as you have 13 University you have

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:07,610
to have a basic way of send getting back

00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:11,059
the information so this is the minimum

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,669
set that all the Federation sent back

00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:16,759
when you try to connect and the rest is

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:22,819
filled by the user so we can have a full

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:28,129
information about this user this is just

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:30,529
for the technical guys this is a picture

00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:34,490
showing the infrastructure we put in

00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:37,339
place as you can see on the left you

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,459
have fusion territories managing user

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,649
but it also has the invitation system

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:45,879
the registration system the public forum

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:50,240
and so on and on the right you have

00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:52,990
luminary that doing the Federation

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,450
support SML to connect to

00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:03,100
Federation and so on and so on what are

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:07,060
the result of this the project has been

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,480
completed last year or on December it's

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,500
open to the unitary Federation so the

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,459
French Education Federation it's already

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:22,750
open to it again that's the future

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:26,440
European Federation for scientific we

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:29,410
don't store anything not needed at the

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,890
campus so everything like password and

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:37,500
such has does never go through the

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:42,310
system it's simplified because we just

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,410
have a link to the user on the original

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,529
Federation but we don't store anything

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,940
we don't want to or don't need to and

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:54,370
then infusion directory you have no full

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,490
workflow of registration invitation and

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,850
public forum that's quite nice because

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,970
now infusion directory you can use our

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,490
template system to make public forms so

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,990
no more coding you just define a

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:15,100
template and then you have a public

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:18,100
forum that's quite nice and this is a

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,990
small video that will show you better

00:10:18,100 --> 00:12:21,459
than me what it's doing

00:10:20,990 --> 00:12:23,519
[Music]

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,519
you

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,970
