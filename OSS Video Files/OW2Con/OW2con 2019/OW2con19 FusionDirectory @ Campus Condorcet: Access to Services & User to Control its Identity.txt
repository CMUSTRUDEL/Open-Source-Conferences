Title: OW2con19 FusionDirectory @ Campus Condorcet: Access to Services & User to Control its Identity
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	For once, this presentation  will not be technical but is placed at user level, process and use case for a variety of different populations.

Campus Condorcet, future campus of social sciences, will receive very different user populations and therefore will need transparent processes that can accommodate these populations in a transparent manner and respectful of the GDPR.

The challenge was to allow registration campaigns conducted by reference persons in institutions in a flexible and fast manner.

Then, it should also allow other audiences to obtain accounts for access to very large documentary equipment and other services that will appear throughout these years.

This conference will show how free software has made it possible to implement this IAM solution in a record time, create reusable processes while leaving ease and security at the heart of the system.
