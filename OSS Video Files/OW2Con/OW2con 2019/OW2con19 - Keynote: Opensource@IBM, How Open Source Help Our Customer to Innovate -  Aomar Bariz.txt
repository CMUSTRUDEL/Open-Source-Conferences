Description: 
	Information Governance Technical Leader at IBM France, Aomar Bariz confirms the rapid growth of Kubernetes in today's IT projects, sometimes associated to the Tekton framework in CI/CD chains. However, organisations have to integrate multiple Open Source Software including blockchain, AI and infrastructure components. Packaging enterprise-class applications becomes a key challenge, in a context where software licences are evolving.

hello everybody my name is amar berries

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm a thank you I appreciate I'm a

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,650
hybrid cloud solution architect at IBM

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,830
my work is mainly to work with on on

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,869
data and lt my customer to to move to

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,960
cloud I I think that you you have rid

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,180
the IBM actually Qi based on the

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,340
acquisition of Ray that we will talk

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,309
about that a little bit later to

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,980
understand how reddit's will integrate

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,399
and cooperate in an IBM organization

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,500
which is I think a great news for Friday

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,590
and also for a for reddit and for the

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,930
market but before doing that I will take

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:58,980
some minutes to give you some insights

00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:02,309
of what we do at IBM on open source ok

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,700
so most of you may know or may not know

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,700
that IBM is a long long long contributor

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:16,549
on the open source community and market

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:21,060
we started with Linux in 1999 where IBM

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:24,299
involved many take his and people and

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,759
the money to to push on the Linux

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,439
Foundation

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,570
we also pushed a lot on a an Apache

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,579
which was one of the our main project we

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,490
pushed a lot on Eclipse

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,130
so I keeps was a my BM solution what has

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,770
been given to the community where IBM

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,549
continue to contribute a deliverer of

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,850
40% on every chips ok so you had a lot

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,299
of other project where IBM put on one of

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,930
the men one was spark and Hadoop where

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,229
we took the open community of Hadoop and

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,299
we put some tolsey for our customer it

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,200
was not on the subscription model but it

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,580
was something like that

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,430
and now we are in a cloud native era

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,569
where we invest a lot on kubernetes

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,719
docker

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:18,750
and where we are a very big partner and

00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,689
the stakeholder in the cloud native

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,000
computing foundation with the with the

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:27,329
with people with the knowledge and with

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,340
the investment in community so as you

00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:32,579
can see in this slide and I think it's

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,099
not the end of the other of the road iBM

00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:37,650
is pushing a lot on open-source is

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,340
investing a lot of open source and is

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,650
also a main contributor and many project

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,889
so let's go backward and what happened

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:51,150
in 2018 so 2019 goes on with a lot of

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:53,700
new things so at IBM we have a developer

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,359
community which is an open so if you go

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:02,040
to the URL which is written on my slide

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:04,079
will see what I am saying there so iBM

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,989
is about three hundred and forty

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:10,319
thousand people around the world let's

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:13,560
say that a quarter of the company is a

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,949
open source driven which means that we

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,109
have many of our techies like me that

00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,000
are doing hands-on on a persons that are

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,909
contributing on open source and then

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,629
that are also I have pushing operational

00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:30,060
solution to our customers why we do that

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,000
because most of our customers today are

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,769
using open source in their project which

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,680
also means that we need to integrate our

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,430
solution with a person's component or

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,870
error we should work on open source

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,489
that's one of our points so IBM is

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,370
giving to his his employee recognition

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:54,690
on operational project and an openness

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:59,220
first contribution so we give 300 cash

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:04,260
award in 2018 for our our techies we

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,530
also have many open source solution that

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,090
we use for managing our cloud

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,129
infrastructure we'll talk about that

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,489
later we'll talk about properties we'll

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,699
talk about

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,170
Khurana we also used elke stack as a

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:22,100
main tooling in our solution

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:24,050
furthermore we also consume many of that

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,840
of those open source in our packaging

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,050
some of our customer says to me that IBM

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,720
is transforming itself to an open-source

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,540
integrator somehow it's true because

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,860
most of our question or today are

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,560
creating developing and pushing in

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,010
production open source project so we

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,670
need to to to to adapt and reinvent

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:49,940
ourselves going forward you can see that

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:53,360
we have more than 900 900 person

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,070
involved in community ok it's not the

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,970
number that every that have because they

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,740
have 6500 people doing that but it's in

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,290
a good way just meaning that we are

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,230
really doing a shift an important shift

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,870
on that that's important to know

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,750
going forward there are waves on the

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,380
market so you have the waves on cloud

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,850
cost then you have innovation and then

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,040
transformation in the cloud you also

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,040
have waves and open source we have ways

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,710
so the waves of open source is that and

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,850
it was the third one that all the cloud

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,290
providers today are providing most of

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,230
the open source component that you need

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,960
so most of them are creating technology

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,380
giving to the market like do idea for

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,370
example and some of them also use that

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,510
for their in-house tooling as we do ok

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,330
and what we see as a fourth wave is that

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,290
even though our customer are starting

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,440
today to contribute to open source what

00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,480
does it mean it means only that the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,660
market is changing that's the main point

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,780
the other thing that we see also is the

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,680
community are are leveraging the power

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,690
to to put on their bit on the business

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,290
of the of the other employee on the

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,000
business market a different way to think

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,430
and a different way to make the choices

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,930
on the technology that's really

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,060
important you know because one of my one

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,400
of the part of my job is to go to

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,490
communities you know I was in a coop

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,120
corn three weeks ago in Barcelona

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,190
and it's amazing to see the

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,349
effervescence that people and techies

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,759
have on those on those technology and

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:49,250
all those techies are working for a big

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,949
company get current company or 500

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:57,110
fortune and so on so which means that

00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:59,690
today we have seen a shift in the way

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,360
that the solution are chosen by our

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,479
customer in the past we have that

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,699
top-down approach which is now dead

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,539
most of the the choice approach is

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:13,580
bottomed out which means that we are as

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:15,229
tikis influenced the way that our

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,780
customer is choosing the new solution

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:21,710
and how they they operate in their

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:24,349
technical choice going back to IBM and

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,330
what we do on the market you can see

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,970
here some projects that are true they're

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,199
really the main stream the foundation of

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:36,830
our open source history and and forward

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,710
so I talked about Linux I talked about

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,300
Eclipse so you have a hyper ledger which

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,789
is one of the main project that we are

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,169
investing on hyper ledger is the

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:51,469
blockchain DNA that we use for our

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,360
customer I invite you to go to the web

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,219
and Google high poly jewel IBM you'll

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,009
see how many project we have today on

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,830
blockchain high which is growing very

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,830
fast we also have docker which is the

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,830
one of the main key stone of the

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,500
transformational or customer we have no

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,969
GS and Cloud Foundry so we I still have

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,130
some customers that are using cloth

00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:17,090
under that there are most of them moving

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:19,430
to kubernetes today so what do we do we

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,419
are going to to work on the on the

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,240
subscription we make some comets we also

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,819
increase the ecosystem we push people on

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,310
on community and by the end we also work

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,440
on the governance which meaning that we

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,310
are participating at a higher level on

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:42,140
this governance community the CN CF so

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:45,259
CN CF 2019 700 sorry seven thousand

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,449
seven hundred people there

00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:53,119
IBM was one of the when I one of the

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:55,279
main sponsor there we we make a lot of

00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,499
onions mantra God regarding kubernetes

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:03,040
docker and other component that we have

00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:05,839
also on this on this these communities

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,670
we are involved since the beginning

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:15,319
which means that we were involved on

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:17,959
many project we have at IBM around 5,000

00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:19,819
people working and involved in CN CF

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,160
following the project which is quite

00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:26,209
important so this community is really

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,670
fast growing and also what we do what we

00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:34,189
did at IBM is we implement the CN CF map

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,559
the CN CF map is exploiting you if you

00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:38,480
want to create a clarity project what

00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,829
are the components that you want we you

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,959
need to use to be CN CF compliant so I

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,910
think that my picture was a little bit

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,829
cutted but if you look at the beginning

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,629
you would see many components that we

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,509
used today and most of them are

00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,959
open-source I talked about kubernetes I

00:09:53,509 --> 00:10:00,019
talked about docker we also have like

00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:03,049
help we have Lindy we have a promoters

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:07,279
graph on our link OD most of this

00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,410
project today are good at the heart of

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,649
our solutioning that we push for our

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:16,160
customer the main message here for me to

00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:18,199
them is iBM is not seen in the market as

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,100
an abortionist company and that and

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:22,970
that's wrong because and we'll talk

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,089
about that later

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:30,139
most of our customer today that have

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:33,069
innovate use our solution for innovation

00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,799
best on IBM support on this technology

00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:39,529
the key factor of IBM and open source is

00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,689
that we bring currents on this tooling

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,209
and we bring the demos support on the

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,610
overall package which is really a

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,189
different shelter for the market because

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,339
most of the customer today are not using

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:55,069
that and out they are using pieces and

00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,120
they always struggle when they need to

00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,370
to integrate and

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,010
that's working and prediction and that's

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,170
where with our 100 of years of

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,250
experience we can bring value to to to

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,180
to to customers

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,890
so let's X let's give some news so I

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,890
talked about the Linux Foundation we

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,720
also have in volume then the open GS we

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,900
have also have in CD foundation graph

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,620
here so all this new initiative today

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,560
are most of them around CI CD initiative

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,960
which means that we we push our people

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,550
we push the communities we involve their

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,940
on the project we have very specific

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,230
people working there the graphical

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,290
foundation is quite important also for

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,710
us we invest a lot on graph QL on those

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:45,300
technology and also we also work on the

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:48,870
open GS so what's the goal of IBM for

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,680
that is to push all this evolution on

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:56,880
kubernetes standard so kubernetes twist

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,470
is there is the standard there for micro

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,830
services and application of

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,160
modernization we also push to evolve

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:08,100
Tecton so Tecton is one of our running

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,700
one of the open source project for the

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,459
pipeline on sea ice on october notice we

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,100
put that it also involved to work with

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:19,500
care natives or a cellular spars and

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,250
also attend cigarette with IBM clouds

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,750
and all other solution which means that

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,450
using this kind of solution is quite

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,260
interesting because it brings to you the

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,240
value to work with the solution in an

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,400
open source platform with the

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,010
involvement of another place company

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,190
that I've already test that and offer it

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,900
as a service for this customer so we

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,930
have created the tectum dashboard which

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,650
has been built by IBM worse we also work

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,290
on a

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,930
pipelining on on Tecton on at the end of

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,880
the day we also worked on and enables

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,880
Jenkins on our platform so

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,779
Tecton it's important so I already

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,630
talked about it so the same slide so

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:06,540
graph QL is important so we do the same

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:09,070
on graph here we have a involvement

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,160
there we have created Nico service

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,680
so work on AI services that could be

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,840
used for the community that are already

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,450
earlier I think most of you have already

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,060
heard about Watson

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:26,230
so those AR services based on Watson are

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,990
already offered in the Indy in India in

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:34,390
the open community and there are other

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:36,790
project so let's finish by the latest

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,160
and most important information for you

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,160
is the acquisition of Reddit so as you

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,930
know iBM has decided to acquire reddit

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,390
in you know in November 2018 what does

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,090
it mean for communities it means just

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,430
good news while saying that first of all

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,370
we that will continue to be an

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:01,420
independent community the business model

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,120
of reddit today is 7 6500 people working

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,970
on community that will continue and with

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,520
adding the value of IBM it will only

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,190
bring more people to work on those

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,470
community that also mean that IBM is

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,960
doing a transformation and the way that

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,450
is working with his customer as I

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,520
explained during my presentation most of

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,370
our customers today are using open

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,710
source to create solution to create real

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,560
prediction systems so that will continue

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:33,280
we do that we just will increase that

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,910
power and leverage the open source

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,750
market to our customer and bring it into

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,180
the enterprise

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,730
most of our customer to date comes to us

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,710
comes to me saying ok mr. Berry's I need

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,470
you because I have some problem I'm

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,710
struggled to put in production my open

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,700
source project how could you help me

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,720
what are the solution that you are

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:58,960
integrating to help me to do so so we're

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,440
at with lower solution could create that

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,680
kind of of packaging that add them to

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,110
put that in a secure one prediction

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,580
because if you look at all my

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,110
presentation and all the interesting I

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,840
see since the beginning of the afternoon

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,520
there are too much component which most

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,620
of the time create too much complexity

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,140
that I think that's something that

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,209
nobody wants to take about that as a

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,670
software under where I come from

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,429
after 21 years of experience I could say

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,110
that that's one of the main problem of

00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:32,559
the business today is the integration of

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,779
this complexity and to avoid to have too

00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,089
much pieces of open-source running

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,949
everywhere they need to have companies

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:41,499
community that puts these things

00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:45,309
together so one of the our our main

00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:48,670
purpose during the next upcoming years

00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:50,920
with reddit is to to recreate the same

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,470
model that open-source community model

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,569
will bring together to create enterprise

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,490
solution with subscription which also

00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:59,350
means that the software model is a

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,019
licensing will change I think that's not

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,699
that's not something that you use to

00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:06,970
talk here but that's what's really

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:08,679
important because most of the go/no-go

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,420
decision on software acquisition are

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,970
based on that model and that's also what

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,550
we're doing so I think there is two or

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,470
three minutes left I will get two

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,290
minutes so if you have any question

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,730
regarding reddit and so on just please

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,290
take the time to do so I would really I

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,350
would be really happy to answer to this

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,680
question okay okay thank thank you for

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:33,550
your time I appreciate thank you

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,550
