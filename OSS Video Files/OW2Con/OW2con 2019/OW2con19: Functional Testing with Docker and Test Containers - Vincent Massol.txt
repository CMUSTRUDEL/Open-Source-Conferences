Title: OW2con19: Functional Testing with Docker and Test Containers - Vincent Massol
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	As a developer, it really helps being able to debug on one's own machine a problem that happened in production, in a given configuration of the software! This is what the TestContainers framework allows doing. It lets you drive Docker directly from within your unit tests and thus to have a very efficient mechanism to run your functional tests in a given environment.

This session will present TestContainers, applied to a real use case (XWiki), with a demonstration of how to use it for writing tests involving a database, a Servlet engine and more. What will be shown: JUnit5 integration, creating a custom Docker image right from within your unit tests, automatic recording of videos of running tests and integration with a Jenkins pipeline to iterate over all the configurations to test.
