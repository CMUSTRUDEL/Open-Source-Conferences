hello everyone how you are doing yeah

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,599
whoo exactly it's exciting today we've

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,150
got two days of action filled super open

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,439
source the numbers are off the charts I

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,660
don't know if you've kind of been

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,490
following this 300 people have

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,900
registered on the site which is

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,080
fantastic in fact we had to close the

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,810
registration site down two days early

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,640
there I believe 60 speakers over the

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,540
next couple of days

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,250
12 demos nine breakout sessions and a

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,629
whole bunch of course interests

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,540
interesting discussions and

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,450
presentations and what's really cool

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,219
about this of course is the energy you

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,270
guys have bring in so thank you thank

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,940
you all for being here

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,530
of you come have come from different

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,480
countries around Europe and beyond so

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,149
I'm going to give up a list I've got

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,820

okay sorry

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,930
you know it's really cool and I think

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,189
that's one of the important things it's

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,140
one of the important messages we're

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,659
going to have over the next few days is

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,899
how open source is bringing people

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,340
together I know we're kind of in a time

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,130
at the moment where there's a certain

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,259
tendency for sort of national

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,730
retrenchment closing the borders and all

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,670
this kind of stuff and isn't it

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,430
fantastic that oh w2 and open source and

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,590
the ideals open source brings is really

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,780
cutting across borders cutting across

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,010
cultures and bringing people together in

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,470
this open dialogue and open

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,319
collaboration so you guys are all part

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,519
of this open movement so well done to

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,280
everyone being here now we're of course

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:39,360
proud to be hope hosting this event is

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,200
the seventh time since 2012 that orange

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,370
is hosted DOW two annual conference and

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:50,549
it means a lot to us to do this orange

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,709
has for many years been implicated in

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,440
open source being acted in active in

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,269
open source we have hundreds if not

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,410
thousands of developers who are working

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:04,170
on open source projects on a daily basis

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,120
now many of these projects are maybe not

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,030
so visible there are core technologies

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,720
but their projects and their teams that

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,760
of course with you are also changing and

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,940
helping to shape what we do today and

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,370
what we do tomorrow as a digital society

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,049
so we look at virtualization

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,790
virtualization of telco networks

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,690
virtualization of course of server

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,200
infrastructures we look at 5g we think

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,660
of IOT and connected devices artificial

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,239
intelligence chat BOTS and that kind of

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,209
stuff and of course a whole lot more so

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,489
really open source is driving the

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,709
forefront and the frontiers of the

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,450
industry of tomorrow and I think that's

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:50,910
something really quite incredible and

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:54,150
quite exciting to see one of the things

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,000
of course that we're doing is working on

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,270
these technologies with

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,400
honors and organizations around the

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,400
world whether it be organizations such

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,370
as the tele management forum TMF or Etsy

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,580
or the Linux Foundation or Cloud Foundry

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:15,230
or the Eclipse Foundation or OpenStack

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:19,190
or of course Oh w-2 so I have to hold my

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,920
microphone up higher apparently so

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,200
orange is proud of course to be hosting

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,260
the ow2 conference and to be involved in

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,210
open source in such an active way but

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,690
what we see is that take up with

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,610
industry is not even its heterogenous

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,200
and this is because of course there are

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,870
a number of concerns linked with open

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,419
source not everyone is still convinced I

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,520
don't know why they should be but there

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,870
are a number of concerns we look at

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,610
compliance we know that license

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,260
complexity is not easy it has to be

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,520
managed we have to manage risk around

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,419
that if we look at business and revenue

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,010
models they are impacted by open source

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,080
and of course then there's the

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,060
complexity of some companies adding on a

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,400
common clause and things like that so

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,410
you know there's these questions which

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,590
people are starting to ask increasingly

00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,450
around open source and we're looking at

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,190
the maturity and market readiness of

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,870
open source and how do we evaluate that

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,120
how do we know that the open source

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,440
we're using is ready to go to market or

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,350
ready to be used in here in our own

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,620
infrastructures how do we look at the

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,970
problem of open source funding in cents

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:33,320
in the terms of maintenance reliability

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:34,820
security developer compensation many

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,850
developers working for companies but

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,250
many developers don't community

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,930
engagement and growth is whole host of

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,690
questions are out of open source so

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,590
we're still looking to tackle and we're

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,650
still trying to tackle so open source is

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,150
not obvious and I think this is another

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,110
key message I really want to point out

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,200
today

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,590
is that for me it's it's it takes work

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,050
it's an effort yes it's a passion for

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,700
many of you but it's not obvious it's a

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:12,740
change it challenges our cultural again

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:15,680
after stickit imagine it challenges our

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,950
cultural and our traditional way of

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,650
thinking within the industry and this

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,950
doesn't happen by accident and what

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,170
surprises me is despite having clear

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,340
benefits whether it's cost efficiencies

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:34,430
or accelerating innovation or of course

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,120
leading to digital sovereignty it's

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,220
still a surprised to see so few

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,880
companies promoting and pushing and

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,190
managing open-source in a deliberate

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,870
fashion many projects are doing

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,660
open-source many companies are working

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,330
on open source but fewer have open

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,100
source program offices or governances or

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,790
head of open source or whichever title

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,530
title you want to put on that and that's

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,410
something we see more in Europe than in

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,180
the u.s. so I think for all of you guys

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,470
and people who girls as well of course

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,030
there are coming from Europe that's

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,200
something that maybe we should tackle

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,510
and we should think about and I also

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,830
brings me to my next and last slide

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,810
because I'm gonna be quick I'm not going

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,550
to really be doing a keynote is of

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,500
course it's a great pleasure to see so

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,750
many of my industry peers here today

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,000
many of them are doing keynotes this

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,880
morning so Deutsche Telekom Ericsson

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,280
Nokia Siemens we have IBM this afternoon

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,620
I know we proved tomorrow so and of

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,170
course orange today so that's fantastic

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,970
so thank you guys for thank you everyone

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,890
from industry for being here and

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,920
traveling to be here today with us I

00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,560
think it shows and reinforces the role

00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,470
and importance that companies are

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,720
placing on open-source I think it shows

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,520
the role orange has within the

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,850
open-source dynamic and of course more

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,940
importantly I would say the road o w2

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,370
has within that European dynamic of open

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,120
collaboration so again thank you all for

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,060
being here today

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,890
enjoy your two days got loads to show

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,870
you loads to talk about I'm gonna have

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,490
enormous pleasure speaking with as many

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,960
of you as I can over the next couple of

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:23,200
days and enjoy welcome

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:26,680
[Applause]

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,680
good morning everybody

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,050
it's always a pleasure to be to be here

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,729
for the ability to conference which is I

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,240
think the most important day of the

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,360
community in the year I remember when I

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,950
first met the the ability to community I

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,730
was just wondering what is this dog

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,400
organization about it is a company an

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,000
association and I didn't know I have to

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,660
say now many years later defining a WTO

00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,210
is still an ongoing process but at the

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:05,000
end I feel like this conference is maybe

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:07,900
what's defined the best rw2 it's a

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,600
meeting of people developers

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,660
decision-makers businessmen project

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,050
officers which wants to share values

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,950
share code share IDs share best

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,420
practices and our values of course as an

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,140
open-source organization they are

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:30,590
defined simply we want our users to be

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,870
free of using our software to copy them

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:37,970
and so on and so on you know the for

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:40,880
freedom of the free software these

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,330
people the community as criminal

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,770
objectives to which is develop the

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,450
organization growing the community and

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:54,070
sustain an ecosystem not only the

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:58,870
project but the company around making

00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:02,300
the project lib live and vibrant

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,580
speaking of which I want to say some few

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,280
words about what happened in the last

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,230
year inaudible YouTube we have welcomed

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,290
three new members three new corporate

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,330
members we have welcomed more than 100

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,060
individual members and now we are more

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,920
than two thousand fifty five hundred

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,570
individual members the code is growing

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,960
we have welcomed new projects in the

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,360
cabeza and thanks to that the dynamic

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,360
rw2 is now recognized as a major

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,529
european open source

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,820
unity with a global footprint as

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:41,290
Christina said we are we come from a

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,399
large number of country are not only

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,709
Europe DISA knowledge meant as an open

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,250
source image or open source community

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:52,029
and others to push our values to public

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,279
administrations

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,800
for instance along with the the Free

00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,269
Software Foundation Europe we have

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,260
pushed the public money public cut

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:06,760
campaign to push and ministration to

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:09,089
give money to open source projects the

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,760
looters project which were awarded in

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:14,829
2016 as best quality project has been

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,660
deployed in in major cities in the world

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:24,010
like Baltimore if I'm correct and we are

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:27,459
involve also in many European research

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:32,260
projects where the role of rw2 in

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:34,450
dissemination is widely recognized so it

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,690
has been a good your 4w2

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:42,250
and it's it's a pleasure for me to make

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:44,410
a point on on this and now I want to let

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:48,910
Cedric speak about the future of a-w-two

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,880
especially with the the market readiness

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,880
level you will present which is an

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,160
important milestone for our community

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,779
and before that I want to thank

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,220
everybody which participate in the

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,160
organization of the conference of course

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:08,250
the management of his orange which

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,250
hostess thank you

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,040
Thank You Christian thank you thank you

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,260
John for this introduction and thank you

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,010
all for being here today

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,930
and I'm here just to share with you some

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,530
housekeeping announcements and the first

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:31,340
one will be to explain the theme of the

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:33,620
the conference this year for several

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,200
times have explained that open source is

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,410
not a free software is not something

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,240
that is monolithic and that people need

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,000
to understand and open the hood and look

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,160
and see what's inside so our vision of

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,920
the version for all sources of three

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,990
layers of course because of the screen I

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,600
have to put the layers in vertical but

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,120
think of closing layers instead of an

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,740
architectural air anyway so the first

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,750
layer is something that started in the

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,440
early 80s with Richard Stallman sending

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,120
this mail saying is going to develop a

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,720
non-unique operating systems etc and

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,080
then went on to define the freedoms of

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,500
open source the film to use read modify

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,750
and redistribute the code and that

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,550
triggered the whole free software

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,950
movement and that was driven by I mean

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:31,970
these individuals parishes to for

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:35,120
recognition and for some ethical values

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,880
post 1968 values of sharing the code etc

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,370
so that's what we call the first layer

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,490
which is a open source of free software

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,810
by developer and for developers and then

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,290
in the middle of the 90s something

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,110
happened

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,760
and for some reason free software became

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,270
commercial open source and commercial

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:58,430
open source became a market entry

00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:01,190
strategy by followers who attacked the

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,970
positions of the property vendors by

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:07,790
leveraging market segments that were

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,180
already more or less mature and they

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,120
managed to well literally make some of

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,550
these big companies disappear I mean one

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,250
of the company we had in France Business

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,300
Objects literally was acquired because

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,189
it was

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,429
while very seriously and deadly

00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:28,679
challenge to bioresource competitors so

00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,350
that's the entrepreneur layer we call

00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,389
that Enterprise entrepreneur layer and

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,920
much debates were between three software

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:38,069
comes open source we're not going to get

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,829
into that so that's the the 90s and the

00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:44,429
turn of the two year 2000 and then

00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:47,129
something happened in around 2010 with

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:50,069
Internet and cloud computing and

00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:53,490
everything related and it was no longer

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:55,649
possible for one company to sell and to

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,649
actually satisfy a business need and

00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:01,949
everybody had to work together and

00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:05,399
everybody had to walk and evolve in a

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:09,569
pack and the main risk for large

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,339
companies were to take the wrong

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,679
direction what everybody else was going

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,589
that way some if you make the wrong

00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,379
decision technology decision you might

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:21,480
invest money into something that you

00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,720
could not get out of and lose all your

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,899
money

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:31,259
think vsh beat Betamax think mini tail

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:34,529
internet so you really want to be moving

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,920
along with everyone and that's what I

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,929
call the ecosystem layer and you've had

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,689
organizations that sprang out of this

00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,490
need for sharing information for making

00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:47,369
sure that we all have the same

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,319
information and we're developing

00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:52,860
technologies that could complement each

00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,869
other the best example we had is

00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:00,360
probably OpenStack foundation that

00:15:54,869 --> 00:16:03,269
really was a proactive movement move to

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,999
actually put people together and work on

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,699
defining a technology but all the

00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:13,829
foundations that have appeared over the

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:16,139
last few years really are a response to

00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,459
the same need which is we need to share

00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,129
the information and make sure that we

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,019
develop all the same technology so

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,369
that's what I call strategy community

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,379
session because instead of developing

00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:30,299
monopolistic positions with premium

00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,240
prices everybody wanted to share the

00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,870
same same product same technology even

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,880
if it was that

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,220
surprise but at least you would not lose

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,160
your investment and of course

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,870
open-source was the vehicle to drive

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,450
this Corrib collaborative innovation

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,279
it's easy to work together with open

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,000
source software without having to deal

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,130
with a negotiate integral property and

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,630
have all the lawyers in the middle so

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,880
this where the three layers we've been

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,040
living with and literally audibly -

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,140
strives on this and then something

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,470
happened last last year with the billion

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:09,790
dollar takeovers we realized that in

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:13,780
fact open-source was becoming mainstream

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,610
and was becoming the towards industry

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,290
maturity and the theme of the conference

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:23,100
this year so what happened is that but

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,829
you have to think that with the

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,650
Microsoft spending 7.5 billion dollars

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,240
to acquire github and IBM committing

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,350
thirty five billion dollars to acquire

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:38,650
RedHat it means that at some point board

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:41,260
members people who don't care where open

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,940
source or technology they may care of a

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,320
technology bit of importance early not

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,610
who represents pension funds insurance

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:56,370
companies investment companies these

00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:00,940
people have authorized executive teams

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:05,140
to actually shop around and commit

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,790
billions of dollars in acquisitions so

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,920
that means that now open source is

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,770
really part of the industry it's part of

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,740
investment and monitor everything is

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,370
being monetized and it's all questions

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,809
about poverty profit Italy profitability

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:23,800
so that's where we are now and I think

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:25,809
we got the whole picture and what we do

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,420
it - W - well we try to thrive across

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,460
these different layers because it's not

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,500
one layer or it's not one phase that

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,720
replace the other it's everything

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,880
combined and some of our company's

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,950
former members belong to one of the

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,050
other or a couple and some of our

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,700
projects are maybe in the middle but

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:46,029
this is the framework we have in mind

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,889
where we think about open source

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:52,869
and hence the theme of this this year

00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:56,200
and this is why we have a incredible

00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:58,739
lineup of keynote speakers by very large

00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,739
