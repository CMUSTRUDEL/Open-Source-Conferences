some people work for CDs Foundation and

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,439
I will give you a research project even

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,390
cross miner and you'll see a switch

00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,300
button for sticking to name cross minus

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,339
Kappa Gamma ID tips kara is actually the

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,649
open source project attached to this

00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,179
European project because my not cross

00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,569
money will finish at the end of the year

00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:38,579
I was here and hope will survive and

00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:41,550
will go up each so what is all about all

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,440
about this what what do you do when we

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,629
look for a component in key that we want

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,070
we need to develop a solution so we're

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,260
looking for some components we don't

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,749
want to rewrite them so we want to grab

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,179
some of them interpret these open source

00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:56,010
of course to do the Epson the set of

00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,899
components that were already know but we

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,170
might be looking for some companies that

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,089
we don't know we don't have for example

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,430
very excited the example of the Nativity

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:07,860
broker is pretty specific it's a

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,930
specific protocol that you use in a

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,850
routine you might want a server which

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,430
will be manager publish and subscribe

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,500
process for you and you look like that

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,729
and and finally you don't find something

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,040
you will find actually too many

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,229
solutions so you can be legally to bit

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,909
more you ever advanced search in the

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,090
guitar which give you some interesting

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,979
inputs and you can specify for example

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,539
the number of stars and number of works

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,729
depending on what you want to try to

00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,860
leverage in your understanding of what

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,230
will be air but valuable company

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,380
in your new arms but Lenny kids when you

00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,820
you versus your search I did the first

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,640
structure a year ago and I which 1,100

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,920
off of answers you have another of

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,690
results and then I did with more

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,979
recently just for six presentation see

00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,229
let's try it again

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,770
he said never exchange and actually I

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,350
reach for 1,400 the problem that we have

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,240
is on get up today and I don't know if

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,119
you wear the change to look at their

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,400
about page but on it up to the number of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,620
millions of repositories as reached 130

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,080
so how do you select these guys how do

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,000
you find the guide you really want based

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,660
on several critters and what kind of

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,910
creature are you

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,130
you are you people of course well we

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,950
want to some code which is well written

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,230
between not only the fact that it's

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,300
respected by the best practices of yoga

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,970
of the of the development and in the

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,730
best design patterns but just the fact

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,410
it's well commented nice copyrights

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,720
written and so on but also you are

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,239
looking for some code which is also

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,150
maintained not diamonds and some Sun

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,880
side you are also looking for some code

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,250
which is also has based on maintaining

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,470
libraries because some cookies we might

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,930
maybe based on saliva reason and these

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,519
guys just are tired of of updating the

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,320
code every other day because there is a

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,310
new version of the languages are using

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,500
so they just decided Felicity whose to

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,150
some old version and they just keep it

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,340
keep it running and till maybe that they

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,260
will discover there is a bigger security

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,730
issue in the libraries are there are

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,000
basil and you are depending on the

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,330
styles you also maybe are looking for a

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,850
positive image which is interesting been

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,880
on under the activity of community how

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,250
it is committees only one guides you

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,860
have the best basa fact is finally the

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,050
like psychosis to another project or the

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,660
company and

00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,600
I usually work for for free and now it's

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,620
like to sell it and so what how do you

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,510
manage the situation

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,950
you also maybe are looking for a

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,630
committee which is friendly with you

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,250
because before units will be very

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,510
important this component you don't know

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,290
about those it's technology you are

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,300
discovering for example I hear big data

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,370
whatsoever so you will need to a kind of

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,960
support from this committee so is this

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,650
guy bash you as soon as was there a

00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,290
question that might be managed and

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,660
finally also you are working in domain

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,460
specific domain and maybe this component

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,560
is very interesting when you are in the

00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,450
IOT but maybe another one will be much

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,370
better if you are dealing with tanks and

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,430
so one will be even better if you are

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,350
doing something else so your competitor

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,450
might be using some components and in

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,100
fact a good idea to use the same or

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,900
maybe to use the other one but which use

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,870
the same to reach at some point a sort

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,210
of compatibility with your competitors

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,100
so it's all about the cross final

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,570
project so it's a European project H

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,190
2020 project we are certain partners I

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,060
will say half and half you have

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:45,950
academics and SM it's mainly involved in

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,020
this project and developer web -

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,360
foundation token sauce condition order

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,860
will you to get Eclipse involved and

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,950
it's all about providing is that - since

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,890
- to analyze not only the source code of

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,360
course but also all the assets around

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,980
the sauce College which is very

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,440
interesting important in cross Manuel

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,390
state a project is not only the source

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,580
code and the command and license which

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,130
are very obviously very important but

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,230
also to understand how the community

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,700
behaves around for this project so you

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,780
need to go through the back tracking

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,670
system

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,200
different communication channels and

00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,570
also foreign that's all so now eclipse

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:31,100
is involved in the research project for

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,580
now since 2013 and we are usually

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,980
invited to just to help our partners to

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,750
open source the code in this case we're

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,580
also interested by the first by itself

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,090
because we also have a community of

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,330
developers we're still at six to more

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,660
than 360 different projects and we need

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,160
to provide this to leverage the project

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,050
that we're delivering and the quality of

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,570
the project whether in probably the two

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,250
which would be able to to show the

00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,540
quality that of the code that were

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,430
delivering and the quality of the

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,650
community wants so we have two main kind

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,050
of users we're only consumers so the

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,300
skies I can be in it you all can be all

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,340
the sources of interest in your company

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,130
you are just want to grab some some

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,750
existing projects and and just want to

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,900
reuse them and we're of course

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,790
developers who as a contributor they

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,210
want also to have a vision of how their

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,570
own project is is is perceived from the

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,640
outside and as well as they want to be

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,979
able during the development process to

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,860
say okay I'm today I'm using this piece

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,660
of code or maybe there is a similar to

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,570
open source project that I could use

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,550
which might be a more efficient more

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,200
adapted more more well man tell me is

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,970
this one's dying special switch to

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,080
another technology how should I do that

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:54,590
and can we can help me out by a proper

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,540
tool so here's the kind of feeds that we

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,710
find on consumer code quality as I

00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,810
mentioned I serve on that weekly

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,229
sustainability is very important of

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,600
course

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:05,330
process maturity is also something very

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,470
important in term of we do do they fix

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,660
regularly the bugs

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,660
how much standard take between the bugs

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,520
million and the bug is fixed did the

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,410
purpose so it time of host always

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,050
imagined

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,730
domains the interest of domain and of

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,740
course the popularity of the community

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,140
or the community behaves in squatter

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,210
usually consumer expecting and

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,880
developers they also expect quality of

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,100
course recommendation as they might see

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,590
okay I use these signals research

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,720
library can you give me some stupid

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,030
codes and a good example of how using

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,710
CCP is so it's something also very

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,930
important and you should be able to find

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,670
them based on some other example you can

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,140
find for an amount for example inspect

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:53,110
and of course the process and the

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:57,850
community as well so it clips is only

00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,550
this kind of quality assessment for for

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,240
ready for several years we already were

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,090
using in literature its dashboard maybe

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,580
some of you know about it so it it is

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,880
project possible who is able to possible

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,670
actually to connect and twelve rolled

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,740
out our bars are our project so it could

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,810
be increased into 12 since this kind of

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,750
issues but it's work its work growth

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,520
occurs and that you can talk about that

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,860
a little bit later and another project

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,900
for us is maturity assessments which

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,730
developed by a company named Cascadia

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,219
solutions and these guys they try to

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,340
aggregate some data to ever to provide

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,930
more semantic based on what you want to

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,430
leverage in your own standing of the

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:44,710
metric that you are able to bring to the

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,380
system so we want to continue in this

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,980
direction to address more project to be

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,810
more easy produced to deal with more

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,060
than just what a time we'll have some

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,460
examples for subscribe I disagree and

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,590
then the practical and contextual

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:05,500
recommendation for our

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,270
and users okay so these are always

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,490
mentioned that there was a businessman

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,230
element across manner and what were the

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:17,740
conditions so how does it work so we

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:21,190
have a bunch of miners which goes to all

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,670
the set of servers get server so

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,589
bugzilla milling leads forums and they

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,150
collected the gravitons information in

00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,010
the history of this information of

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,260
course and so we have the natural

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,060
language and our analyzers where

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,050
configuration analyzer sues for the

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,240
miners as well and we gather all this

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,050
information and also metric extracted

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,740
from this miner

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,260
you know in a knowledge base and then so

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,680
for this to spot we are able to extract

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,620
quality measurements patterns from text

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,510
mining community motions it's it's one

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,410
aspect that I actually like the most in

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,180
this project it's personal personal test

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,420
also and also interesting aspect across

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,950
project relationship so you can see how

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,440
your your project build and the

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,080
dependency is a project to find their

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,450
similarities or strong dependency with

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,790
some minor components and these are all

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,800
components system configuration and

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,240
knowledge is fashion as I mentioned

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,420
before snippet code and Stack Overflow

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,510
which are two example of extracting

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,390
knowledge from from the code so from

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,130
this database we can go through I will

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,870
not go in little basket here Valerie

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:36,450
will

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:39,270
mention that the we have exertions of

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,160
data warehouse which is actually yeah

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,970
yes the search Saturdays and on top of

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,430
that you can we have a Cabana dashboard

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,220
you can build up even a dashboard it's

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,050
adapted I like to see customized

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,790
deposits this reasoning test in any

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,560
event eater we have also an eclipse

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,890
plug-in that you can install in your

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,830
workbench and you can have some must

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,600
some search dedicated search to find the

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,010
library that you are looking quite close

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,010
the language that you are interested in

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:13,470
and ultimately libraries if you want to

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,200
switch to another kind of libraries and

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,540
you can have some cadets instant

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,910
recommendation on sanity ice and of

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,150
course you can directly access in the

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,160
Year database with West api's and

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:58,890
extracts on raw data and I use this

00:11:26,160 --> 00:12:07,410
example and so if you add some weight

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:14,820
and chop them you surprise joy and as if

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:17,640
you had some weight you get you you have

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,650
a vision of our project and the mood of

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,839
your coming here on your project so you

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,010
see that your initial interest after

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,870
that is flat

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,520
maybe because I is not too much a key T

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,620
on your project and then shouldn't leave

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,980
there is some movies so lots of interest

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,300
lots of excitement and maybe then at

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,790
some point that they find some bugs

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,370
people not react enough enough quickly

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,490
that so people are happy delivery and

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,440
yeah so you have the you can have a

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,000
representation is very simple and quit

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,630
will be

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,700
of the community and how did you mean to

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,250
behave on the project if it's a racket

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,080
coming here and so on so it's kind of

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,900
interesting information that we want to

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,390
be able to extract from the data that we

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,830
are collecting and - so for now it's a

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,050
level of this project

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,450
we're extracting the data and we are

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,010
working in the present in is a time the

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,140
best in the best way and we will show

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:13,160
you some example later on whether you

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:16,730
were and silly so summarize we have four

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,120
major features we have of course I mean

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,670
UI to select a different project you

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,430
want to analyze and all the different

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,430
servers and that we need Aransas project

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,530
sources project web portal which does

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,210
all the quality actually temples model

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,330
so you can describe aggregation of

00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:42,710
different data metrics and generate more

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:46,850
more advanced level on your project and

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,710
you have that eatery Cabana dashboard to

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,110
graphically represent this information

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,650
and finally you have sequence plug-in to

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,050
to manage that the developer level so

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,850
you can have a project search and this

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,320
is similar if management and public

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,880
managers quit because it's my role also

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,160
to mention that yeah but it keeps going

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,990
events happening full you are more than

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,650
welcome into at the middle of self talk

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:16,220
so you can't meet the book if you have a

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:18,740
talk on this great subject as well and I

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,990
finish with some pointers so feel free

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:26,089
to go and follow this community of

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,760
Viennese this research project it's very

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:32,600
interesting and very promising project

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,950
so you have a mailing list and also the

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,190
reference of the metrics that we're

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,190
using

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,140
