good afternoon everyone

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,179
my name is Philip Bahia and I'm a

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,150
technical project manager at the city of

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,240
Paris first of all I would like to thank

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,810
uh w2 for having us once again here to

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,150
present our solution so Thank You Cedric

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:29,670
and owt team so I'm here to talk about

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,450
our open source solution which is called

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,930
we test made out of the ancient name of

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:44,460
Paris on top of which the state of Paris

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:47,250
that you all know has been built so last

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,190
year I've done the presentation of the

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:55,039
whole solution it was a very long very

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:58,050
detailed so I welcome you to see it

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,219
since I won't do the same over and over

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:08,850
it here and this is just well a

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:13,260
milestone in the roadmap of this of the

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,960
life of holidays and I'll just show you

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,860
where we've been and where where we're

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,040
heading so for those of you that won't

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,790
check out my presentation of last year

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,070
just real quick what is it about salutis

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,740
was developed internally by the city of

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,220
Paris since 2002 and which represents

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,500
now more than 2 millions line lines of

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:44,250
code it is if you have to remember only

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,490
one thing a powerful city services

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,790
engine it provides a module platform

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,490
based on lightweight core features on

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,570
top of which you can add either on one

00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,840
shelf plugins or you can develop and

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,240
integrate your own it is a solution

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,680
based on real needs over time and which

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,479
is constantly evaluating and it

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,080
represents now more than 200 city

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:18,970
services then it is an open source

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,520
form four cities made in in Java and it

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,420
enables a quick develop deployment of

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,640
the of city services based on stone

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:32,260
standards it is secure

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:36,790
also as GDP Oracle client and it offers

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:39,270
solutions commonly needed in a municipal

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,610
space let's face it

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,690
municipalities share maybe 70% of their

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,170
needs so this is what loot s is all

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,140
about

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,350
it provides a citizen relationship

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:58,050
management that we also reuse internally

00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,050
for our 60,000 civil servants and

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,200
provides also the just among others

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,120
powerful workflow engine that enables

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,830
specific actions for our business

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,980
applications so obviously it's used for

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,400
all digital services at the city of

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,680
Paris it was firstly released as open

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,830
source software in 2002 we were the

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,400
first French public administration to

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:32,730
release our source code and to open it

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:37,690
and it's a quick way actually to develop

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:40,420
the elected officials engagements that's

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,300
why I said it was based on real needs

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:50,080
we just don't develop things hoping

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:54,820
might be used but we are told to develop

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,630
these features for the citizens we

00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:02,620
either use them as standard applications

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:07,420
or we hackin when there are two specific

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,340
needs to fulfill and it's also reused by

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,739
other cities and companies in France it

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,590
was firstly many years ago used by the

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,669
French weather forecast and since it was

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:23,460
the first most visited website in France

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:26,210
we improved a lot thanks to their work

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,440
most of it on

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,210
load of heavy load managing the city of

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,160
Rome which is the second city in France

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,580
is also using you test it's been voted

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,199
that their next city services would be

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,990
entirely done in a new test and now they

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,300
also contribute back we're getting their

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,740
code and there are contributions to our

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,259
platform many other cities in France we

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,020
cannot keep track of all the venn of

00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:01,580
them but they use it in different many

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,580
ways last year we were also in Baltimore

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:09,770
to showcase leutis in a context that

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,810
will develop next slide but now the the

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,960
University Johns Hopkins University

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,190
based in Baltimore has helped us to

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,400
implement the test for a non-government

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:26,389
organization which helps to provide

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,520
services for left over communities so

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,340
how citizens benefit from the test well

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:36,620
first of all to make the administration

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:38,810
easier it provides a form generator an

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,520
appointment plugging system tak

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,030
simulator I won't name them all there

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,300
are more than 200 it's easily

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,110
administrable by non non-technical

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,440
people so the CMS which is just a plugin

00:05:51,110 --> 00:06:00,590
out of it and can be used and fully

00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:03,080
administrated by non tech people we have

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,919
in mind that tell us once innovative

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,560
idea management which is using France

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:14,270
leutis and based on an open ID Connect

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:17,360
and we have a single sign-on enabled in

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,110
the CRM see standing for citizen we're

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,659
not dealing with customers but citizens

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,449
and we also provide them the citizens of

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:29,210
centralized citizen dashboard and which

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:33,580
they can see their digital

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,580
Administrative Procedures at real time

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,129
more than making the administration

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:44,029
easier it also helped people get in

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:49,279
in the city since it's a very important

00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:53,449
will from Maori delgo to gather people

00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,489
around real-life issues in their city so

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,699
we've developed the participatory budget

00:06:55,489 --> 00:07:01,699
as soon as she got the head of city of

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:05,360
Paris as well as public consultations

00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:09,379
streets problems reporting system etc

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,300
etc and I won't need to convince you

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,610
that open source is probably the best

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,479
way to enhance trust between citizens

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,379
and the administration so why are we

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,839
right now we are a team of 212 people

00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,019
inside city government we're working

00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,649
with contractors the helped us develop

00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:32,569
new features and maintain them we've

00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,329
also worked a lot with the the Bloomberg

00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,729
associates I would like to thank them I

00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,969
won't be able to thank them enough for

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:45,199
the help they provide they've

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:48,379
benchmarked the best solutions Digital

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,339
Solutions over the world in the biggest

00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:55,369
cities in the world and we're in this

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:58,429
book and they also provide code of

00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:03,050
reviewing by DLP and the help us

00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:06,199
translates everything as well as the the

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,379
user experience we're used to dealing

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,379
with French people we all know the

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:14,479
context is very different in many in

00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:19,159
many other countries so they helped us a

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,919
lot doing this as you probably saw it I

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,829
will show you right after they help us

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,219
also rebrand the solution since we're in

00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:32,389
the public administration there is no

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:34,639
budget for marketing selling talking

00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:38,870
around our solution so they're there

00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,870
they're here to help us and we've also

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:45,680
worked with most labs which is a

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:48,399
institutes in the US for OS positioning

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
and consulting

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:58,740
we're trying our best as I told you with

00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:02,430
low and decreasing budget and to aware

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,360
better at the solution more broadly so

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,430
where member of the you lw2 consortium I

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,000
know of many French houses fast

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,000
associations

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,470
many awards one one name the mall we

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,770
were featured that Johns Hopkins

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:23,130
University for a hackathon organized

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,630
last fall for this first time Civic

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,280
track so we had a very technical

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:35,070
workshop there to help the students

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:37,110
develop only des and will there's a will

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,670
to to be more present as forums

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,670
conventions but where are we heading

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,070
we're heading to enlarge our community

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,470
so we're trying our best to attract

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,130
passionate developers to contribute and

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:58,020
hence and build the sustainable

00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:00,120
development community we have a will to

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,230
be part of other communities communicate

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,630
better share our best practices and we

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,750
also try to have more pilots and

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,520
adoption within the cities or

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:16,380
administration or governments everywhere

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,380
and maybe next step will be assess model

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,550
we'll see

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,550
