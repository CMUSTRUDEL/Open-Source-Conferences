thanks for for being here we are proud

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:17,130
to present you a torch about lemon

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,590
lapping G lemon LDP is a project since

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:26,609
10 years inaudible you to ecosystem and

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:30,779
I'm happy to have here people from Honda

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,940
- an island I will explain to you better

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,649
than me why lemon and up is a good

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,480
product

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:44,399
first to begin some what about the

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,860
product we are doing with lemon and

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,250
Apanui what we call single sign-on it's

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,930
very easy to understand the role is to

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,440
manage authentication on web application

00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,300
so the the workflow is simple you you

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,850
connect to the application you are

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,790
directed to not eat additional

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,180
application portal and you get token

00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,650
which is trusted by the application and

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,439
you can validate the application can

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,840
validate his token so this is the easy

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,659
part but you will see that in singers

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,810
hang on you can have different protocols

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,960
and light each as sammelan

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,170
of open and connect and lemon LDAP

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,640
implements all this protocol some

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:41,009
mystery we on the project was funded in

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:45,570
in France in 2003 and was forked by

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:50,579
Honda - Anna in 2006 and since since now

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:55,700
we are working on this ng version which

00:01:50,579 --> 00:02:00,570
is raising your new major version every

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:03,810
three years manufacturer are of course

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,670
in your sign on but a big picture video

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,950
featuring the nominal diffuser access

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,880
control so you are about where is the

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,740
man enough to decide

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,590
which user can access to which

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,320
application and of course we added in

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,500
the last big version which is which is a

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,100
lemonade app 2.0 some big new feature

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:29,240
like multi-factor authentication and web

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,570
service protection here are some sample

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,290
of course like other projects if you

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,960
need a demonstration you can go to me

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,440
and I'll show you how it works so this

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,900
is the login page and you have also a

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,160
partner with an application menu so you

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:53,720
can display to your users every every

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:56,780
application that you can access and we

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:01,280
also have a and web initial web

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,610
administration interface but if you want

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,150
to that tip come online you can also

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:11,210
take them online of course it's the free

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,120
software we are proud of that it's a GPL

00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:18,170
license the the product is not owned by

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:23,540
a company but we are several companies

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:29,440
and organization contributing to it some

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:31,850
some focus on the worst the the the most

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,270
important part is the portal which is

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,750
serving the authentication form to the

00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:43,400
users and it is also managing all

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,380
specific protocols but you also have the

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,990
manager which is a an assertion

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,220
interface and also the under which is an

00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:56,720
agent which is able to protect the

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,040
access to web applications in me in the

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,680
middle of that you have also

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,600
configuration and session database to to

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,300
share all the data between all these

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,150
components so for web application you

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,250
see the under can act as a an agent

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,090
protect the web application it's a an

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,060
easy way to use a nominal app but we

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,620
also support or a standard single

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,720
sign-on protocol

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,310
like Justin salmon an open-ended

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,949
connector in the last version we have

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,820
the multi-factor authentication so any

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:37,510
of these two factor is supported in a

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:42,020
liminal that and we added some extended

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,150
features like DevOps we use diverse

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,729
because it's cool to say DevOps in

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,280
increments okay

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:52,940
the goal of this is to to be able to

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,940
deploy application in containers without

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,669
to be forced to update the software

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,700
configuration so you can just configure

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:05,870
the single sign on walls in the the

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,780
locale or worse JSON file and also we

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,060
are doing your web service and with a

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,580
non-law which is a service to can allow

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,820
you can protect a web service just like

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:22,850
you protect a web application also we

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,310
are using o2 under the open and

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,010
connected protocol and you can also use

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:33,800
all to access token to protect the web

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:39,710
application last what about a Renata

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:45,830
which is a Federation Federation group

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:49,430
in France we we just released a new

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,990
version which support this Federation so

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,940
you can use them an LDAP to join the

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:59,419
Renetta on a to join Federation and if

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,900
you need to extend the software we have

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:04,910
no plug-in engine in 2.0 which can be

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,880
used and which is heavily used now by

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:11,570
Jean domination arrow and we have plenty

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,669
of example of of plugins so you can use

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,479
a standard lemon and a pan and add your

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:21,289
own one feature on it

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:26,090
ok that was a little technical but no I

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:28,760
pass the microphone to orange so they

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:34,630
will present what they do with the lemon

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:38,140
LDAP thank you thank you so around go

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:42,680
around and lemon LDAP is a long time

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:46,610
story but beginning of June 8 it was a

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,380
first way to implement it in real real

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:53,990
case

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:55,669
now few months ago and we start but it

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,060
may be surprised

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,159
orange is a complex number and not

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,479
surprising we have a lot of people with

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:09,710
different kind of jobs of course

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:13,070
developer finance support a chair

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,770
marketer extra extra extra and when we

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:19,340
want to create something we need to

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,599
address all people of course I can't

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:27,580
give the same tool to under share people

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:32,330
finance people or an IT expert so first

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:36,979
complexity we have thousands application

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:40,460
I say thousands applications about

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:44,330
10,000 applications some of them have

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:49,789
been built inside home authors have been

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:54,010
bought with say the UN protocol sometime

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:55,870
summer sometime chasm time nothing and

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:00,650
sometime

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:05,389
strong things we have and of course

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:11,229
everything is moving all the time today

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:14,510
or developers won't get tomorrow what

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:19,010
what what will they want we not know it

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:23,930
Chandra about one time per year maybe

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:33,810
often so we need to find a way to work

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:36,960
with all that motion so I've said

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,140
orange is a complex world and a complex

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,120
number or not we have orange people but

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,000
we're also working with external people

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:52,160
contractors partners universities under

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,190
the same rules some time with freelance

00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:00,630
in the orange world yes sorry in their

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:04,260
orange world we have to create accounts

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:07,470
for people and it cost us about 10 to 20

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:16,130
days very difficult it's not a charge

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:16,130
for freelance of three days walk we are

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:27,330
lot of I've said that lot of tools we

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:29,880
are born with in an example after some

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,670
time or tools are accessible from

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,080
internet also time only an intranet

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:40,800
another point of complexity each and of

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,850
course each application has his own life

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,190
cycle with thousands application I let

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,400
you imagine what it could be it's a

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,400
nightmare

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:58,020
or user won't of course same quality of

00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:02,730
tools as what's a use on the internet at

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:05,520
all if I use something like it lab at

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:09,600
all because I'm developer I want same

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:17,100
thing at work it's a mini mama this is

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:19,950
rice of fashion tool so we start from

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,589
the beginning with we have the same

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,690
controls and say ming tsai and also

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,990
we've tried to do something very

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:32,370
interesting we've asked people what they

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:38,450
want not always the case in orange and

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:41,820
we'll list the type of this list so

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:44,490
support a lot of protocol yes we've seen

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,180
a customer extra extra maybe tomorrow

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,450
other

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,930
menage all type of notification or

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,810
josuke is not always a case

00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:00,850
access from Internet to intranet a

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:04,450
single way to authenticate people for

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:08,410
all the cases extracts crap but I think

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,040
what I prefer say keep complex tube

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,180
sorry

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,750
simple stupid keep it simple stupid

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:19,960
that's not the case in standard way of

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,830
work we are doing complex signal what we

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,720
want what all user wants is to do thing

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:32,080
simple simple for users simple to

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:40,840
implement simple to integrate so

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:45,300
question so it's we wanted to build

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,220
something scalable and we wanted also to

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,920
answer to the different question that

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,290
were asked

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,830
so to give access to external to give

00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,850
access to internal so it's the the kind

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:06,220
of infrastructure we we set up so as you

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:12,390
can see we we used many of the proposed

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:15,040
features on the top it's the external

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:19,830
lemon and on the bottom it's the

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,900
internal lemon and it was plugged with

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,700
for example our Kerberos infrastructure

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,840
it was plugged with our LDAP

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,990
infrastructure it

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,780
it was also correct with our Sun in the

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,940
first lecture we also used the sam'l

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:40,030
between between the lemon we also tried

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:44,080
the the various second factor

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:49,560
authentication Yubikey TOTP and

00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:52,810
and even male-male based second factor

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,860
so it's all the product we we've tested

00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:01,570
with we've lemon up so you can see from

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:03,490
which success so means get lab a metal

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:10,269
post will press next cloud JIRA

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:14,820
OpenStack the key wiki graph an eclipse

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:17,829
shake controls and the Apache modules

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:30,399
the sample modules and the open ID

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:32,079
connect modules so under the to make

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,279
this we've got two three three three

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:40,990
steps the first dozen the first team to

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:43,660
think that we we did so test laminin and

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,029
try the limit just the the potential are

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,029
she textures test integration with the

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:55,480
20 application almost 20 application we

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:59,649
we tried and test the value set up LTP

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:03,670
ATP systems then we've got the second

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:10,870
team to to build to get the results from

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:13,660
the the the first the first at first the

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:18,670
first team and then we'll have the final

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:28,720
team to run so it's some work ongoing

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:32,560
and it's a our organized so to do this

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:37,540
we we we set an partnership with vortex

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:40,839
maybe you want to maybe just a few yes

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,550
as we already say this is a free

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,470
software without the lead of company and

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,490
we built this partnership with orange

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,730
for the first year

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:57,950
and the goal is to help the development

00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:00,459
of the product so orange will ask some

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,350
feature to vortex and as vertex is a

00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:07,130
contributor to the to the software it

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:10,520
will develop our batch etcetera so if

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:14,089
you need some information you can come

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:18,680
to the vortex booth to know how we we

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:21,170
build to this this framework contract so

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,930
you use the model we already

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,899
experimented for four points of software

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:31,570
so it's a ticketing ticketing model

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:33,950
which is quite flexible and it's done

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,339
spindle with the above question pata

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,510
pata solid which is a in charge of open

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:43,339
source things in orange and every

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:48,589
business you need can can request

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:55,250
request help from this ticketing system

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:58,070
and we can also contribute to the to the

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:03,490
roadmap with some evolutions we were

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:08,209
already asked some evaluation of what we

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:16,459
we used in integration well also Don

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:21,140
would report it so the thanks for

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:24,079
contribution contributors usual the

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,020
Lehmann LDAP team of course vortex for

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,529
the supports all the internal

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:42,740
contributors and big help of coffee

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:44,540
machine and chocolate oranges at the

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,560
beginning and now from Des Moines su

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,600
Nala have with experience with you

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,200
thank you so we'll try to tell you the

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,089
success story of the denominational and

00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,999
starting with the genesis of the the

00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:02,339
project and it all began in 2002

00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:05,850
with the when the genomica

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:08,730
desperately-needed first web SSO and we

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,639
bought the software site minder who was

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,149
doing the job at the time but was far

00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:17,459
too expensive for us the cost was

00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:20,039
approximately 1 million euro per year so

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,049
we decided to take of a liminal dub from

00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:28,350
the Ministry of Finance and fold it and

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:32,730
as Clemens said in 2005 mostly 2006 we

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:35,039
develop liminal dependi and it's now the

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,440
single sign-on software used by almost

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,659
all civil services and I say almost

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,429
because the misra defense I believe is

00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:46,649
using a key clock and you have to

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:51,980
compare the 1 million euro licensing

00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:56,149
cost every year with what it costed us

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,399
for since 2005 and it's less than

00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:02,639
300,000 euro so I think you can call

00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:09,210
that a success story because we we

00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:12,000
spared a lot money and the team is is

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,029
mainly composed of four persons that are

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,730
dedicated to to the administration and

00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:24,029
the development of liminal pengie and so

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,740
the mr. Kumar who is not here but is the

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:29,429
lead developer of the manoda pengie and

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,980
started in 2005 as a captain and is now

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,830
a two-star general so he can can picture

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,389
the the path that has been accomplished

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:43,139
and mr. Madhu is in the room here and as

00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:46,590
contributed to the development of the

00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:48,600
2.0 version and more specifically in the

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,980
plug in about second factor

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:57,299
authentication we have different

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,340
platforms seven actually one called

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:03,269
proximal folders on the armory a second

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,610
one for the police one called C with

00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,519
only a service provider with the

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,369
internal security services should you

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,770
wear with a service provider on that is

00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:15,860
accessible on the

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,970
networks and two single silent solutions

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:23,450
were accessible by internet and we also

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:27,860
are doing identity Federation's with 12

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:31,610
civil services you can see the

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,100
statistics that are that I speak for

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,960
themselves so the number of quest

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,700
everyday number of unique users everyday

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,970
and the application that I used every

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:44,120
day and that justify our infrastructures

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,850
of 12 reverse proxies 7 LDAP server and

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,300
four portals that are quite overly used

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,850
every day and I have a few more figures

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,940
for you that maybe will impress you or

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,660
not so this is the connection peak

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:05,930
during 10 minutes so as you can see we

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:10,670
reached 11th connections in on Monday

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:14,240
the 13th this is the big the even speaks

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:16,520
during 10 minutes so which is a five

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,220
five the five hundred and fifty

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:24,140
thousands event which is basically a

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:29,420
HTTP request in 10 minutes so it is

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:32,090
roughly 1,000 requests every second and

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,790
this is the peak of unique users during

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,720
10 minutes and it's at 8 o clock when

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,170
Jean Dom's

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,380
arrived it works so it's around 40,000

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,260
connections and the last no it's not the

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,660
last one so this is the number of unique

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,430
users every month so this is consistent

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,760
with the fact that we are approximately

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,920
100 thousands and arms in France so you

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,480
can see that it's approximately what we

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:02,960
have here and the last one is every good

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:07,610
identification every month so this is

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,400
quite heavy as well what we expect for

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:14,660
the next two years is to regret all

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,870
platforms in limonada pengie 2.0 which

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:22,490
has already started with C and Proxima

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:25,940
we also trying to implement connect

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:28,360
agents which is the open ID protocol

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,990
and also second factor identification

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,419
mainly for our reservists that are

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,169
authenticating through internet and we

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:41,149
also we will also try to implement the

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:43,429
SSO as a service not only because it's

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:46,309
cool to say DevOps in a conference but

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:50,320
also because it's a it is asked by our

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,320
