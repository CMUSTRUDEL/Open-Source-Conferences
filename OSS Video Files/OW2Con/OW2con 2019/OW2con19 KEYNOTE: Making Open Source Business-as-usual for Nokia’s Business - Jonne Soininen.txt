Description: 
	Making Open Source Business-as-usual for Nokia’s Business
Head of Open Source Initiatives at Nokia, Jonne Soininen lists the business benefits of using and contributing to open source software. The right selection of components, however, depends on industry alignment, project timing, industry timing, and project governance.

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,790
the thing is I'm Jana Sonya Ninh I work

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,900
for Nokia my title is head of open

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,750
source initiatives I run my team run run

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,689
said the open source program office but

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,550
we are also coordinating the different

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:30,990
open source activities in Nokia that are

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:35,190
related to Nokia actually being engaged

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,980
in o near the chin being mixed engaged

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,879
in open source activities an open source

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,890
program projects outside the previous

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,800
presentations have been more talking

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,960
about using open source software my kind

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,559
of weight on this is our emphasis is

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,370
more talking about how we are actually

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,039
engaged in open source software and but

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,680
when I hope that during my presentation

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,640
what becomes clear is the es are

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,840
actually interlinked things and rather

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,880
than just there was a beep interlink

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,130
things rather than something that I are

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,060
separating

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,830
I joined again Nokia so I haven't dart

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,180
passing Nokia I've joined for the first

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,210
time for in 1999 but I left Nokia in

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,070
2011 to do something else and joined

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,380
back in 2014

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,829
since when I'd been actually responsible

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,680
for open source in Nokia this is however

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,479
not the first time that Nokia's doing

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,540
open source but let's look at first why

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,320
we're doing open source and open source

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,810
as clearly let's put it quite bluntly

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,729
first our customers want us to use open

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,439
source our customers want us to be

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,079
involved in open source and they say

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,450
that out very clearly and these and this

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,939
is something that because this is a way

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,439
where we can actually work together in a

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,189
different way than what we have worked

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,700
in the past actually we were talking on

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,720
the break that telecommunication

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,200
manufacturers have been in the forefront

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,050
of open source and that is actually

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,760
quite natural

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,220
in telecommunications what we have

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,400
learned over the years is worth working

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,770
together we have worked together a lot

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,080
through standardization different

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,800
industry activities and so on when we

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,200
created different standards on the for

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,930
the phone system and especially in the

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,940
mobile phone system which became global

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,060
standards so we were used to working

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,480
together already so open source is

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,340
natural progression of that but an open

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,890
source is also the first time we're

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,900
actually it's not only a just a

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,050
corporation of paper but where our

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,600
customers can also contribute themselves

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,660
things that they think are necessary and

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,720
also at least theoretically even

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,480
individual in the people can contribute

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,410
and we get innovation from outside that

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,660
we wouldn't get otherwise and I have to

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,030
say this is very much true these

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,760
individuals getting active in in these

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,830
things like in projects like Linux but I

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,020
have to say that this might not happen

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,350
that's often in something's quite

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,140
esoteric such as telecommunication

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,209
network management systems that are not

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,230
maybe the most sexiest things in the

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,570
world why do we do open source what are

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,390
the benefits that we see and these might

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,070
seem actually thinks that everybody says

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,709
about open source but actually when

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,260
everybody says that some of that must

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,870
really be true we love the openness so

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,610
we have a lot of lower vendor locking

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,370
that is what our customers want but this

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:55,300
is also what we want from going

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,550
downstream we the joint innovation when

00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,880
we do things together we'll learn from

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,620
others we get faster development this is

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,330
something that is always a little bit

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,400
difficult because people say well

00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,440
actually the development is not faster

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,260
and I have to say that is true there is

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,489
no faster development than when you

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,190
alone write code but and you don't have

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,160
to look for any kind of like consensus

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,740
is this good or not but the thing is

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,590
what you don't get is the collaboration

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,120
that's just you writing something you

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,400
don't get anybody else

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,460
this input that doesn't really get

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,050
better and when something gets really

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:41,020
big like Linux or OpenStack or cube

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,139
unities it's just impossible to drive

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,720
that just within one software team or

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,880
within one company it isn't the only way

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,550
of doing that is actually together

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,680
otherwise you will grind to a halt and

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,729
you will be really really smart moving

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,830
forward security this is also that

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,650
people say well this open source really

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,139
secure because I have this one package

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,410
that I downloaded and that we had a bug

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,900
in it yes you're right and you can find

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,729
bad open source software as well but

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,530
generally when you look at that and open

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:18,010
source software that has a vibrant

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,440
community behind it it really is more

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,500
secure than just proprietary software

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:29,070
and the quality also is related to that

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:32,380
the same phenomena whoops wrong button

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,740
the interesting thing for us is

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,200
basically that there is if you want to

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,990
be a part of some open source software

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,169
project there are a lot to choose from

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,090
so you have to think carefully which are

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:49,780
projects that you actually want to be

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,479
involved in and so that what we we try

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,139
to look at these four things when we

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,990
choose a direction and we choose

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,000
basically which projects we think are

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,669
useful of course the first thing is that

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,710
it has to be useful for you it needs to

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,720
be an open source software that you want

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,389
to be part of you want to contribute to

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,550
and you because you want to use it

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,210
because it's beneficial for you that's

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:19,270
of course table stakes but then you when

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,300
you look at the project you look at the

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,520
certain kind of things that is it

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,060
actually viable over long term and that

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,580
is what we looked at these four things

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,419
industry alignment timing industry

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,000
support and project governance industry

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,190
alignment is basically that you have to

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,650
see that there is a common problem for

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,470
the industry and for the open source

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,810
that they are trying to solve if there

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,449
isn't you most probably or there's

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,669
confusion what their problem is you most

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,889
probably won't get good code and you

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,690
won't get a good direction how from the

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,960
project and the project is not moving

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,020
along nicely the second thing is timing

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,820
is this right time to solve this is this

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,639
project timing right

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,340
is there another project that has been

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,470
before it that would be a better thing

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,210
that you should put your time and effort

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,419
in rather than starting a new one for

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,490
instance this comes very often

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,470
especially when we talk to you

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,360
internally or our people who are really

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,880
interested to open-source something that

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,310
they've done my first question is who

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,320
are your who do you think that has done

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,419
this before and why you are not joining

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,720
them rather than bringing something new

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,960
into into the community that will

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,720
further fragment the community and give

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,380
put in just another logo on the page

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,110
before then the kind of like there needs

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,139
to be an industry support which means

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,060
that not only that this is a common

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,160
problem that we share but we are

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,490
actually willing to invest into that so

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,979
are people willing to put actually pairs

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,970
of hands and developers into these

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:09,940
things people will often confuse this

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:12,490
with are you willing to pay $250,000 to

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,180
be part of an Linux Foundation project

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,050
and or 50,000 or something like that and

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,760
that is always the small money though

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,830
that it is real money when you put it

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,289
all together but the thing is actually

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,210
are people willing to put developers

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,639
behind these are the actual willing to

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,370
put a lines of code are they willing to

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,680
work on this then the last but not least

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,690
is the project government and this is

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,900
actually also important on when we use

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,789
software is that okay what is this

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,750
community about is this a community

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:49,240
actually at all so is this one company

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,520
that is publishing software and you

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,709
cannot actually affect it is it

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,360
something that has some strange license

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,860
that actually doesn't

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,130
give you the rights of hope and source

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,490
or if you contribute to that that it's

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,459
actually under governance of one single

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,740
company or one single entity and so

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:11,200
being active in something what we look

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,459
at is is the project governance really

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,550
like that that we can participate in a

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:21,040
constructive level and when these four

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,750
things of course with a fifth one that

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,750
we're actually interested in this

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:29,019
software are together then we look at

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,310
then we think that these that kind of

00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:36,670
like open source project is viable

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,709
we don't necessarily we like open source

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,630
we do a lot of open source but that

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,930
doesn't mean that we do open source on

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,360
everything we look at really then also

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,550
that where we can really add value we

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,470
don't go to every single project that we

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,350
think is viable but we look at it that

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,930
where we can add value add value

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,949
ourselves and of course something that

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,390
would be software that we could use

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:05,230
internally and that we have an interest

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:08,550
in we wouldn't go just to go to a

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:12,310
project that we wouldn't use ourselves

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,800
but we also do proprietary software that

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:18,130
is quite clear and I want to be clear

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,199
about that that is what we see us our

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,870
differentiation and we see that

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:26,730
open-source software really is at its

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,940
best where the participants in that

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,949
project feel that that software is non

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,019
differentiating between them that

00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:37,060
doesn't mean that there would be not be

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,980
somebody else in the industry that would

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,560
find that well you are writing software

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,050
that I have proprietary and that is

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,180
differentiating that's just fine

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,980
but they at least the people that are in

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,550
the project have defined that they have

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:56,350
an interest to collaborate rather than

00:10:50,550 --> 00:11:01,060
then keep things to themselves like it

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:03,699
said earlier on their standardization

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,470
was in this telecom space before so

00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:08,040
that's why we have actually this

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,160
experience of working together in

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,420
telecommunications

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,520
and that has not gone away and the there

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,200
are all every now and then there are

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,240
discussions about will open source

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,240
skills standardization or is open source

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,880
needed is a sanitation actually the way

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
how grown-ups do this and people and

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,670
should we all cut our hair and actually

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,540
do something really nice in Etsy or ITU

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,720
or so on um and I think that the this

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,150
discussion is actually not very helpful

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,090
the open source has it's clear early its

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,970
place and so her standardization I don't

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,740
think that open source will replace a

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,340
quote-unquote replaced standardization

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,880
or Sanders ation is in any ways

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,650
competing with open source we have a lot

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,430
of open source implements a lot of

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:02,740
standards standards reference to open

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,480
chores and they're what we are in the

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,060
world where these two things have to

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,030
work together and I think that this is

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,580
has happened it's a and this ongoing

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,120
already we have a lot of examples of

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:20,760
that that basically we have even now

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,170
groups what were open source and and

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,190
specification or standardization making

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,590
work very close together so what does

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,490
this mean to Nokia is that we select

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:35,530
which openness organizations or which

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,310
openness technologies we use actually in

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:41,140
our in our products we like to look at

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,960
the world through what we called the

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,820
future X architecture where we put the

00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,190
different elements or a different

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:54,040
domains of the telecom networking and

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,380
there we see that there are really there

00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,130
are different layers where different

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,990
technologies are important and some of

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:08,110
them are open source and some of our

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:10,480
them are sound cellular space how do we

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,320
do this how do we use software and how

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,200
do we contribute to open source software

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,180
basically we started off I think the

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,370
sedgwick gave you this presentation in

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,900
the morning which put the four time

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,690
zones off or

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,440
different kind of steps of evolution of

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:32,260
open-source and we've gone through

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,740
something similar internally we mostly

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:39,610
had proprietary led software when we

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:43,390
started in the late 70s doing network

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,790
equipment that was how everybody did it

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,220
we'd be handed our proprietary hardware

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,800
we had our proprietary software and we

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,380
were basically doing that all ourselves

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,990
even though operating systems and so on

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,850
then all we started using open source as

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,970
a component a little bit kind of like a

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,600
library there a library here an IP stack

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,730
there and putting it in and we also

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,230
started to use even bigger components

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:14,470
like operating systems we used FreeBSD

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:20,080
very early on when Linux wasn't quite as

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,910
adapt to that task yet and we what we

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,680
did is what everybody does for their

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,800
first open source software take the

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,050
software modify it for your own benefit

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,910
and keep it internal and then you think

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,089
that I know how to use open source

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,839
software that doesn't work very well

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:39,790
that's one particular product where we

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,170
had changed freebsd which was for a

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,140
differentiated area in the beginning

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,300
design after a little while was not a

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,970
positive differentiator anymore and we

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,250
had to rewrite the whole product so what

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,610
this has done come is to the cup where

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,860
we're today is that what we try to do is

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,690
when we use software if we have to

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,959
modify it if we think it needs a feature

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:05,350
if we find a bug if we want to modify it

00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:09,820
in any way we upstream it back right

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,650
away this is not just of course like it

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,110
was said in the morning you have to give

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,140
back but this is not just giving back it

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,120
is beneficial for you yourself that you

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,070
don't fork the open source software

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,390
because you will be in a world of pain

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:27,220
with your fork software when the

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:31,930
community has run away from you and it's

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:34,450
much ahead of you I'll skip that and

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,000
just come because I'm I think I'm

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,040
running out of time very soon

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
two minutes left okay excellent thank

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,030
you the thing is basically that we do

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,180
have an open source or program office

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:52,510
like everybody else that does that where

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,480
we look at basically where who owns the

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,180
processes of using open source software

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,040
who make sure that is responsible for

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,760
the compliance of open source software

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,190
and that is for the usage side so we

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,800
basically make sure that all our

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,410
products before they get out of the door

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,320
before any release guide gets out of the

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,090
door that we have done gone through our

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,870
open source compliance we understand

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:22,360
which licenses are there and we do

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,240
comply to those licenses in that

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,840
addition what we do is that we look at

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,720
the contribution also what goes out from

00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,670
Nokia this doesn't mean we don't have a

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,280
central organization that contributes

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,890
out from Nokia well what we really want

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,160
to do is to do that what we had in the

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:45,220
previous slide which is the kind of like

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,370
arm opens of software is part of the

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,950
normal R&D so it has become a part of

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,720
our normal R&D function when a use open

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,240
source software you expected to

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,450
contribute if you change that what we

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,760
just do in the in our open source

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,850
program office is basically make sure

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,589
that we do that deliberately we do that

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,839
coordinated in a coordinated fashion

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,550
that there isn't not one group for Nokia

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,230
one week and the next week somebody else

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,690
is trying know from Nokia is trying to

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,560
delete those patches which could happen

00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:19,900
if you don't coordinate it anyways

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,180
but the thing important thing is the

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,459
open source contribution itself is part

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:32,020
of our product R&D process how do we see

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:35,050
this moving forward is the working

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,450
together in open source fashion it's

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,420
only going to be increased this is not

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,930
gonna go away this is not a hype that

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,910
will go away this will become a part of

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,130
your normal development and you should

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,330
be ready for that but what will will

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,049
also continue is differentiating

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:56,649
between vendors we will continue to in a

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:59,409
friendly way to compete with our friend

00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:01,880
with her friendly competitors and that

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:05,630
that will not change

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:10,610
so as I'm show to the stop sign this is

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:13,370
my last slide and we're Nokia is really

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:16,260
embracing open source and really opening

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:21,849
up innovation with it thank you

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,849
