Title: OW2con19KEYNOTE: Free Software: Mainstream in Industry, What About Society - Matthias Kirschner
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	Throughout history technology has influenced society. Reading, writing, arithmetic, agriculture, printing and radio are all examples of developments that changed the way we interact through trade, art and science. The most important cultural technology of the 21st century is software. It runs our workplaces, laptops, mobile phones as well as less obvious places like trains, cars, televisions, washing-machines, fridges, and many other devices. Today it depends on software how the government can implement laws, who will be able to join which university or job, or if and how long people might end up in jail. As people and companies who create software, we should consider how our actions influence the distribution of power in our society â€” and thereby our democracy.

thank you all for being here and I would

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,380
also like to thank the organizers for

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,299
taking care about all those details

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,160
which are necessary for such a

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,869
conference but often when you attend

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,000
such a conference you don't notice those

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:26,400
so big thank you to everybody involved

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,710
in the organization here when walking to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,859
the venue this morning I have seen

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,829
thousands of computers they are

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,770
everywhere so they are there are those

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:42,420
desktop computers the laptops tablets

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:46,890
mobile phones but and and lots of

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,170
computers in those huge server rooms but

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,660
there are also more and more devices

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,920
which include lots of computers by cars

00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:01,920
trains trams

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:06,360
planes washing machines elevators you

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,260
name it they are everywhere and whoever

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,119
controls those devices also controls

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,070
what we can or what we cannot do with

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:21,320
them sometimes those devices are even

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:26,520
inside our bodies like hearing aids or

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,950
pacemakers and people who control those

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,439
devices also control what those devices

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,329
are doing so it's not so much just

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,009
devices around us where software is

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,290
controlling what we can or what we

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,070
cannot do in our lives but there are

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,979
more and more procedures where software

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,560
has an effect on us for example here in

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,439
France there is a software which decides

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,640
which pupils can go to which university

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,610
and for a long time that software was

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,799
kept secret and nobody knew what exactly

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,060
and how exactly the software is deciding

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,729
which pupil can go to witch University

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,590
after some time the government was then

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,650
forced to publish how this software

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,720
exactly works and just stand

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,690
you were able to have a discussion about

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,980
if those rules in there are right or

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:27,400
wrong if it's if the programmers writing

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,310
the software if the implemented rules in

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,049
a way which are fair towards people so

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,730
that they can go to the universities

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:38,290
they've won and where they have a huge

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,420
effect on their career so before that

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,519
you cannot have a discussion about

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,519
software and rules you don't know about

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:53,170
in the UK and in the u.s. around 60% of

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:56,829
the software of the job applications are

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,739
checked by software before and they

00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,690
decide also which of the applications

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,459
will be seen by humans lots of the

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,739
applications will never be seen by

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,180
humans at all because it's before rated

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:13,750
by software so those companies which

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,000
write this software later decide who of

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,310
the people will get a job a high-paid

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,380
job or no job at all who will never be

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:27,459
invited to a job interview you cannot

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,380
know why you are not invited to a job

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,299
interview if you don't know what are the

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,700
rules in there why do some people get

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,859
higher grades than others we cannot have

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:41,319
a discussion about that in society if

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:44,829
those rules are secret and in the u.s. a

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:48,190
lot of the federal states they use

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:52,750
software which predicts how likely it is

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:56,410
that someone a criminal will commit a

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,599
criminal a crime again so they will get

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,500
a percentage how likely it is that they

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,099
will commit a crime again how this is

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,810
done

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:10,810
is not clear even the lawyers who have

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,980
to defend people from going into jail

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,930
they don't know the exact rules why the

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:22,030
person they are defending might have a

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,300
60% or 80% rate of getting back into

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,270
prison

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,550
becoming criminal again so there is a

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,060
decision which might have a huge impact

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,830
on your life or your relatives lives but

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,560
you cannot have a discussion if those

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,780
factors are the right factors things you

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,760
there if the program must made mistakes

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:49,950
if the companies are biased in some way

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:52,380
you cannot do so so to go one step back

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,690
and talk about the generally how

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,290
software regulates us and what is more

00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,770
specific to software emulation to loss

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,000
if you have a look at this treat you see

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,830
that there is a sign that you are not

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,940
allowed to drive faster than 100

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,300
kilometers an hour now if I promise you

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,950
I mean first of all you have a good car

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,480
second there is no living being around

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,340
which you can hire who you can harm who

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,740
of you would drive faster than 100

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,380
kilometers an hour okay I also mentioned

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,610
there is no police nobody there who will

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,730
see you okay more coming up so you can

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,770
do so you can try faster than 100

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,810
kilometers an hour here there needs to

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,700
be police they need to see that you're

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,870
driving faster they will give you a

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:49,770
ticket but you also have the possibility

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:54,180
to try faster and later justify this

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,830
action so for example if your partner of

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,220
all your child is sitting next to you in

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:03,390
the in the car and is bleeding and you

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,730
drive the car to the next hospital well

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,280
police might also agree that it's it's

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,620
okay that you try faster than 100

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,740
kilometres an hour or later you can

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,650
justify it is in front of court and tell

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,800
the judges why you did so so it's a

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,570
possibility the other thing is that if

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,010
you don't know when you haven't seen

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,030
this sign because you looked on the left

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,070
side to those beautiful mountains you

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:34,319
cannot comply with laws you don't know

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:37,930
about so

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,190
who of you would try faster than 100

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:51,060
kilometers an hour here some Bavarian

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:53,289
heroes you don't need police there to

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,539
tell people that they should not try

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:58,419
faster than 100 kilometer an hour you

00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:02,800
also don't need any signs there and even

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:06,789
if so when you try faster here you will

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,729
be punished for that by physical laws by

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:11,770
the architecture of the street even if

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,560
you have missed lots of school classes

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,520
and you don't know anything about

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:24,099
physics those laws still apply to you

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:27,729
there is no exception there so you see

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:30,699
that with architecture you don't need

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:34,449
someone who complies who make sure that

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:38,169
you comply and you also if you make an

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:40,300
exception well there aren't that many

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,270
churches where you can still then make

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,030
your point why you drove faster and why

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:51,580
it that would still be ok so you got

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:54,219
your punishment for that and now about

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,120
not a point if I have a class in my

00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:00,490
hands here and I opened the hand most

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,289
people in this room here can predict

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:08,919
what will happen while when this is a

00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:09,900
virtual room a digital space and I open

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:14,380
my hands

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,699
anything can happen the glass can stay

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,240
there the glass can go up to the ceiling

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:25,930
we can when we might all end up in jail

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,750
get him over whatever we don't know if

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,880
you don't know the rules like in some

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,640
implemented in software in a digital

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,849
space you don't know what the programmer

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,430
came up with it's very difficult to

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,860
estimate what might happen while in the

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,659
physical world it's possible you have

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,480
lots of experience which will tell you

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,630
what might happen or not in the digital

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,290
area it's

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,340
very difficult so to summarize with

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,430
software it's regulating you even if you

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,980
don't know about its existence it will

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,800
influence your Yodas what what you can

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,410
on what you cannot do there needs to be

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,050
nobody who is there to make sure that

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,100
the laws are actually implemented and it

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:16,100
that you don't cheat it's also very

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,960
difficult to predict what can happen and

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,230
what not if you don't have access at

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,760
least to the source code so those are

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,840
all factors which are which are

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,750
different there and you also you cannot

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,930
make an exception it's not possible to

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,990
say well I just do it the other way and

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,150
it was important because of know if this

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,440
accept exception is not implemented in

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:47,390
the software it's not possible to do so

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:52,070
so this French person here it's his name

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:55,940
is Montesquieu he's famous for the

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,520
concept of distribution of power so you

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,410
meanwhile have that in the democracies

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,800
around the world that you make sure that

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,130
there is the power in a society is

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,680
distributed that you have the people who

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,490
create laws that you have people who

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,400
make sure that people actually comply

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,790
with the laws and you have others who

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,220
make sure that when someone didn't apply

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,040
to the laws that there is a procedure

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,020
about handling this beside that you also

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,060
have all kind of other levels of

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,700
distributing power like the federal

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,150
states and so on so the goal there is

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:43,090
that there is no single point where a

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:48,850
lot of power is is concentrated yes so

00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:51,410
now about technology so in theory our

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,560
system might look like this yes we elect

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:57,350
some politicians and then they are in

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,040
control of certain aspects like in in

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:06,350
this case the weapon system

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:09,620
well in a area of more and more digital

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,560
influence in our society we also have to

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,180
consider this aspect that the people who

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,270
control the technology who designed

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:23,720
contrology that they decide what can be

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:26,330
done and what not so free software is

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,380
one piece in this puzzle on how to

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:34,070
distribute power in our society to make

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,170
sure that not one one single player is

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,510
too powerful there and that we can have

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,940
discussions about what is right and what

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,880
is wrong how are the rules in our

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,470
society which influenced us so those are

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,630
all things which can be done with free

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,560
software but this is one one piece in

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,930
this so in order to have this

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,440
distribution of power and make sure that

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,570
people understand this we have to make

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,720
sure that the majority of people out

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,940
there understand that software should

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,890
give them the rights to use that for any

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,730
purpose that there is no discrimination

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:14,960
in there that you can study how the

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:17,690
software works so that you can actually

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,760
have a discussion about is this right or

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,990
is that wrong what is regulating us as a

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:27,350
society furthermore that they understand

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,510
that software gives you the right to

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,360
share it with others so you can work

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,250
together on solutions and last point

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,310
that software should give you the right

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,280
to improve software to adopt it to your

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,730
own needs so that you as an individual

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,070
as a company as public administration as

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,310
a government don't have to change your

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,320
behavior because of the software or you

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,570
cannot change your behavior and

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,790
procedures because of the software but

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,250
that you have to comply to what someone

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,720
else decided what you can on what you

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:07,250
cannot do furthermore it's important

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,010
that people choose free software as

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,470
their default choice so whenever someone

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,590
is using or developing software that

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,030
they choose freeze

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:20,130
after doing so and for political

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:24,570
decision-makers in a world where more

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,760
and more of our also digital area will

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,640
be regulated by political decision

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,610
makers it's important that they beside

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,260
understanding what free software is also

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:40,280
understand how free software relates to

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,050
freedom in general self-determination

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,420
transparency privacy and those issues

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:51,120
and that they can connect that and also

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,540
act accordingly on this and we have to

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,150
remove barriers to free software

00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,330
adoption so there should not be any laws

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:03,480
and regulations and these steps which

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:09,330
prevent people from using or developing

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,460
free software and furthermore it's

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,830
becoming more and more important to

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,710
provide resources and support to other

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,810
organizations out there and helping them

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,770
to understand those issues and I'm not

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,240
just talking about IT organizations but

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,460
I'm talking about all those other

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,090
organizations where software now becomes

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,850
more and more relevant think about the

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,740
student the pupils Association which

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,220
wants to make sure that there's a fair

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,430
access to two seats in the at

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,150
universities think about the union's who

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,670
are now confronted with software

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,040
filtering out job applications and some

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:53,060
people never been invited to to a job

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,570
interview or a human rights organization

00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:00,810
who wants to defend a person but the

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,370
software says 99% likelihood that the

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:07,350
person will commit a crime again also

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:09,270
nobody knows why this is the case so

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,760
this will become more and more important

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:18,030
there now one specific part here where I

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,440
wanted you to help us to provide more

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,980
resources and provide more information

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,410
as last year marks meal my colleague

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,120
talked here about our campaign public

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,040
money public code as well

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,170
so one thing I would like you doing

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,620
which doesn't take a lot of time is go

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,420
on public code you read the open letter

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,279
there which demands that publicly

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,470
financed software should be published on

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,779
the face of your license so that at

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,029
least software which is financed from

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,800
public money is transparent and we can

00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:49,589
have discussions about if this is right

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,899
or wrong and can make changes there sign

00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,879
this open letter then we have videos

00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,970
there in several languages including

00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,649
French please share this video with your

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:05,069
friends so that they also understand

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:09,120
this issue and as a third part sent the

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:10,350
open letter the the video and our export

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,389
pressure there for public

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,670
administrations to three people either

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:19,499
politicians or public decision-makers

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:22,050
people in the in the public

00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,930
administration and tell them about that

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,149
and to send them to pressure so those

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,800
are some concrete steps which I hope

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,199
that we can increase the counter here

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,509
with the signatures and that we reach a

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,709
little bit more people here than before

00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:41,759
so even if it's later 50 people more so

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:44,429
yeah beside that there are still many

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,339
people around the world who do not yet

00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:49,679
benefit from fundamental rights like

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,189
freedom of the press freedom of assembly

00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,470
freedom of speech lots of those which we

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:57,959
often take for granted they have to

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,420
fight for them every day and even if you

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,910
once achieve them and you have them in

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,679
your society it doesn't stop there you

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,770
have to exercise them and you have to

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:11,699
offend them repeatedly and in a world

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:14,970
where more and more of our life is

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,669
depending or influenced by digital

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,819
technologies we have to support those

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:22,829
out of freedoms by fighting for and

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,260
defending our right to control

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,100
technology by defending software freedom

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,880
and by democratizing software so thank

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
you very much

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:38,650
and yeah

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:41,080
so last part I would like to thank all

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,390
the contributors and donors of the

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,110
efforts of e who make over possible or

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,970
do the work and I would appreciate it if

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,550
you either also contribute to our work

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,430
and get involved or if you would also

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,780
like to become a supporter and enable

00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:04,099
our work so thank you very much

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:04,099
