Description: 
	Throughout history technology has influenced society. Reading, writing, arithmetic, agriculture, printing and radio are all examples of developments that changed the way we interact through trade, art and science. The most important cultural technology of the 21st century is software. It runs our workplaces, laptops, mobile phones as well as less obvious places like trains, cars, televisions, washing-machines, fridges, and many other devices. Today it depends on software how the government can implement laws, who will be able to join which university or job, or if and how long people might end up in jail. As people and companies who create software, we should consider how our actions influence the distribution of power in our society â€” and thereby our democracy.
