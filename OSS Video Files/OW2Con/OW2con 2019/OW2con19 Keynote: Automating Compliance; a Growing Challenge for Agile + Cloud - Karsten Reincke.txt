	Automating Compliance: a Growing Challenge for Agile + Cloud
A precious keynote to remember the main aspects of Open Source Software compliance. From the datacenter to the smartphone, multiple licenses have to be managed for open source systems, kernels, components, libraries, applications, and containers. A real challenge with software updates on the fly and CI/CD chains.
