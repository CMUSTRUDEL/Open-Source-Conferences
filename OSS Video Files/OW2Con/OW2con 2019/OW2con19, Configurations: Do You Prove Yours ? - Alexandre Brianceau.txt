Title: OW2con19, Configurations: Do You Prove Yours ? - Alexandre Brianceau
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	How can we be sure of the continuous configuration management proper operation? How to expose factual topic-related reports to dev, sec, managers, customers...?

We believe that, in order to deliver the full business and collaboration value of continuous configuration management, the solution needs to go further than simply applying policies - it must ensure configuration reliability; prove historized application and status; share it to other teams; notify of any drift with a relevant context.

This talk will present why and how we should be concerned about transmitting factual measures on infrastructure management to all parties involved. We will also guide you through the journey to include a full-fledged reporting feature in a configuration management solution.

hi hi everyone so I'm Alex and Aubry and

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,620
so I'm working at rudder with a

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,509
configuration management systems so we

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,699
are mainly focused on compliant systems

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,740
and so I'm here to talk about you about

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,130
configuration management so automation

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,160
on your servers mainly and specifically

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,590
on what you can prove from your

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,560
configuration basically most of them

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,239
most of us are mainly focused on the

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,950
automation part and so I will show you

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,930
that you can go deeper than there the

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,910
first use case that we can have that

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,250
okay you're managing configuration like

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,550
Bob is a sysadmin typical system in from

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,039
an IT company and as such so is

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,570
responsible and in charge of all service

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,039
maintenance and configuration

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,949
maintenance okay but is not only for him

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,350
it's probably for other consumers and

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,680
probably colleagues such as I don't know

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,250
there is mark from the Big Data team

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,340
that have some issues on his application

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,080
so we can ask to Bob okay what is going

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,200
on I have issues on my online

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,650
application can you explain me and check

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,770
the logs

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,830
there is nothing okay does there is

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,740
nothing means that always okay so is

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,450
like cool no not at all maybe you missed

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,810
something why you could miss something

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,650
is of course because now it's more and

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,280
more complicated IT is made for

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,619
automating all the information of course

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,649
so we have many environments we've got

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,049
many middleware we've got many OS we've

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,049
got many users we've got many use cases

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,700
so it's very hard to manage all the

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,420
things this is why there is

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,880
configuration management and automation

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,670
but it's not only the the only problem

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,740
you've got also more and more teams that

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,570
are working together and are concerned

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,430
by your infrastructures you've got the

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,600
security ones you've got this is some

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,340
means you've got the dev one you've got

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,910
also the users

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,490
and all is deluded from this team

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:21,000
because there is not only one Superman

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:22,920
that could do anything and everyone from

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,230
the first part of the problem of the

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,670
people is that every one of his own

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,860
culture and in on his home tool and so

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,540
they've got different needs of course so

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,020
you can have the chief information

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,569
officer of that needs just to know if

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,280
his IT is reliable and working

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,130
you've got the security staff that need

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,010
to know if my security compliance is

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,950
okay and they've got different needs but

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,370
all are coming from the infrastructures

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,800
and so if they need to get the

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,250
information from someone else maybe they

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,750
can have only a small part of the good

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:05,850
information that they need and so it can

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,190
lead to misunderstanding so I talked

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,800
about configuration management and I

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,049
talked about reliability so what we need

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,299
to just remind us is that configuration

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,489
management is made for consistency of

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,680
its systems the objective is just to

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,170
maintain your configuration okay that

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,750
your IT is working and everything is ok

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,910
if it's not it's not configuration

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,810
management it's just simply automation

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,730
and why I talked about that is because

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,790
there is more and more discussions about

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,410
DevOps and dev sack UPS DevOps is now

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,120
like 10 years old or something like that

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,799
and the black ops is more recent but

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,739
it's pretty much the same it's just

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,180
putting the team working together and

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,560
what things is very great and very

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,870
simple to understand with DevOps

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,910
approach or the F Cyclops approach is a

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,519
four pillar the cultures to working

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,140
together but also the automation of your

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,420
IT systems so you can have a very good

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,250
way of working that is very easy with

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,160
automating all your stuff you can just

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,590
have in charge what you're made of

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,190
your pre value your you know where you

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,410
can make your your part as a human but

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,150
if you only take the site from the

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,799
automation part you really miss

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,380
something the visibility of what you are

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,480
doing and so this is why also there is a

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,690
measure

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,940
it can provide you some factual Evans

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,120
factual information that had to be very

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,090
useful to share with other people so if

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
you have factual information you can

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,210
work with your security team with your

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
production team with your dev team and

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,400
others of course it's very simple to

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
tell to talk about that but this is also

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,500
why there is like unstable towers that

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,390
is really a great product because of

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,580
that because they can visit they give

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:55,370
visibility to their users so for people

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,070
that are not so aware about what the

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,830
configuration management tool is we are

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,710
not talking about just automation and so

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,050
not about scripting and steps we are

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,940
talking about a state that you want for

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,200
your service like I want my users

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,680
present or absent

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,430
I want my package on my system present

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:21,050
or absent or present but with this exact

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:23,710
version and so it's it important like it

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,420
was said there is a few talks now and

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,270
from these configurations that you want

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,190
to have you will decline a configuration

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,170
a simple configuration that will be

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,060
applied on your note so on your note is

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,860
the name that we called from your server

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,950
or your machine or your laptop or

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,990
anything and from this configuration you

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,090
have a feedback like a nun Siebel if you

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,400
run it you've got the result of your

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,990
feed of your job that is running is it

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,780
ok or not from that said you only have

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,150
this feedback at the end is it ok or is

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,270
it not so it's a simple of subversion

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,190
and if you have multiple notes you've

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,780
got multiple configurations on multiple

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,740
feedbacks it could be very complicated

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:09,140
to know which one is in default and of

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,450
course it could be applied to the same

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,700
machine because you are not doing just

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,430
one thing on your service basically

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,080
you're doing I don't know like five to

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,630
five hundred checks or something like

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,090
that it could be some stuff like that

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,190
and so it's very hard to know what is

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,500
going on if you have any trouble in your

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,070
configuration so this is just about what

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,870
configuration management do and if you

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,260
are just based on the simple feedback

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,230
that you have at the end

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,990
we'll have some issues to find where is

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,540
my problem where is my issue you can

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,080
guess but it's not sufficient you have

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,510
to you need to have the right level the

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,980
right skill to understand and to guess

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,760
something that is accurate to your

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,520
systems so what we found there is now a

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,920
few few years now also else

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,630
specifically in monitoring Centurion do

00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,420
a lot of stuff about that with

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,570
observability observability is just to

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,810
say okay I want to observe a system but

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,460
from the inside and if you're very close

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,580
you've got the right amount of

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,180
granularity so you can easily know where

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,520
there is a problem a simple way to show

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,040
that is like that a simple monitoring so

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,140
just looking from the outside your

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,810
systems and you can guess that you've

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,360
got a trouble with the triangle or the

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,640
octagonal systems you've got an issue

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,440
you don't know because it's a black box

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,410
for you you just have the feedback that

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,300
is okay or not okay with an

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,810
observability approach you can really

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,670
know from each step and you know from

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,520
before the state after the state and at

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,140
each step you can prove and find and so

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,490
if you've got a full traceability of

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,860
your systems so what could it brings

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,950
from the monitoring systems to the

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,120
configuration management systems it's

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,230
very simple as I said you've got a big

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,350
big improvement from the causality

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,600
because you can prove when you have a

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,580
system that is observable that the

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,550
problem is coming from this part exactly

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,950
because you miss this package because

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,920
it's not available from this repository

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,450
because it was accessible I can access

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,790
to the repository but the packet does

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,190
not exist on this repository this is the

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,740
real problem and this is what assisted

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,630
mean or a manager need to know when you

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,780
have a problem and not just I can't

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,720
install my program so this is the

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,760
causality part because of that you've

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,210
got a better perspective that is

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,940
relevant to your to your domain so this

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,340
is very actual for a system in part but

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,140
if it's also security you can know that

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,019
maybe

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,350
you can have you have to to had a more

00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,579
fresh repository to your systems because

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,010
of that so you have a better perspective

00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,810
and you can have factual Evans that

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,089
could be shared between the team and so

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:06,560
this provides also better agency

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:13,220
agencies just to make it very easy to

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,200
collaborate okay so this is was like an

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,959
introduction it's a very short also I

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,339
cannot go very deep and I wanted just to

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,890
introduce you what observability is and

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,930
of course because we're a configuration

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,620
management system focused on the

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,720
compliance so rudder is made for making

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,959
your ID compliant even just for a

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,230
reliable system or for for security

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:42,079
purpose so it's a very simple tool upon

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,740
source of course very very mature there

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,540
is like nine years now we exist and I

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,120
wanted just to introduce you how we

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,600
handle it in in rudder and how we manage

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,920
observability in rudder for that I have

00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,860
a more deeper talk it's not by me it's

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,170
by Nicolas in like four days it's it

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,649
will be on Friday I think at the open

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,620
source Springs submit it will more talk

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,410
deeply and technically about our wit

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,730
managed by rudder word easily in radar

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,110
so you've got the left part the

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,720
techniques and the directives it's

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,519
basically the configuration so you've

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,860
got a configuration template which

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,680
called techniques and after your you are

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,390
giving some details like what what users

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,490
or what that I want to manage with my

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,620
techniques on with my configuration and

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,180
on the right parts we've got the nodes

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,910
because you want to apply your

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,310
configuration to something so we manage

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,660
it through groups that are dynamically

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,579
and allow allocate it and all is

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,800
connected through a rule so a rule is

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:49,550
what configuration is applied to which

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,490
systems and this is allowing each kind

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,029
of users to use it from his own purpose

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,399
so this is a basic Oh rudder works the

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,709
basic workflow so you have se CLI you've

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,490
got the web UI full complete web UI

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,050
Italia

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,200
you to make all the configuration part

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,170
and you've got the relevant part that is

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,779
relevant from your business proposed so

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,240
you want it that you want to know if

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,980
your security rule is applied on all

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
your systems or maybe you want to check

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,550
if a system is okay when you're

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,720
connecting on it because you've got an

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:26,480
incident on it and this is the most

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,149
complicated part so as I told Loser is

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
all the directive as of the

00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,709
configuration part the group and the

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:39,950
nodes and all the parameters it's a blue

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:42,050
block this is always the trickiest part

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,480
because it changed every time your

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,950
assistant min is doing something it's in

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,080
this side but also you've got

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,089
environment are context because when

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,060
you're using a template or an external

00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:55,370
file to configure this your systems it

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,500
can change from the time that you make

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,630
the change and now because you've got to

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,610
beat it important you need to be aware

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,459
that you can apply each time the same

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,680
configuration so all of that make a

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,740
configuration file ready to apply to

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,630
your systems and after that you've got

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,360
the nodes that will download the

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,810
configuration and applying it but more

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,279
than that in reader you've got anything

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,079
that is at one step have a change

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,089
request or something like that so you've

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,820
got all the restore ization of anything

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,100
and so you can also expect what will be

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,660
the feedback of your nodes so you send

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,800
the configuration or at least you

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,079
produce the configuration the

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,540
configuration is download and you can

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,520
already know that in five minutes

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,380
normally the nodes should answer me

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,209
something like that because you you can

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,149
expect what the change is because

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,640
everything is Easter Rising rather

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,529
thanks to the observability systems and

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,950
everything also is easter eyes

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:57,920
it's very complexed and we are very

00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,290
grateful that the founders are further I

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,720
have already this observability approach

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,940
in mind when they produce the system

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,029
from the beginning it's very easier now

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,640
that everything is horizon everything of

00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,780
a very clear step that making the

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,020
configuration repeatable and can

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,720
proved at anytime and what we can do

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,180
with that is making something fancy like

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,980
CV management so you've got CV

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,780
assessment it's very simple

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,540
you've got your your own configuration

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,610
your own nodes you've got also some data

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,330
from the external part like from the

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,700
cert and another's or the defenders at

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,610
publishing their their CV e their own cv

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:42,000
e and so this is a typical example of

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:45,210
something that it it moves daily or

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,880
maybe hourly or maybe each minutes and

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,890
so you need to be able to prove that you

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,560
found that your system is variable you

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:55,530
find it you can list it you can know

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,560
when you found it and you can say okay I

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,170
want to remediate and after I can tell

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,650
okay my systems is not variable anymore

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,140
from this part and I can prove it so the

00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:11,340
question is can you prove your

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,740
configuration and if not please just

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,410
take averages in mind because automation

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,630
is just not the only way to do this it's

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,340
a first step but also you've got the

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,990
solution and the business approach of

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,780
what you're in charge and what you're

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,760
responsible off thank you very much and

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,710
you can check on rudder ratio if you are

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,620
you want to have a D mode sorry it was

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,180
maybe just a little bit technical but on

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,550
the rudder ratio there is a full Teemu

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,710
and you can just play around and feel

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,530
free to ask you we are also on the get

00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:43,930
er chat so you can ask to the community

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:46,860
some questions thank you thank you

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,860
