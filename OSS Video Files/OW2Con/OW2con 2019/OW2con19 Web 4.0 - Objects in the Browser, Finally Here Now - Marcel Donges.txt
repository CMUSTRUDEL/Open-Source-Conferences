Description: 
	If we want to build an Internet of Things, we have to build an Internet of Services first. This is what i said 2005. After inventing it in the cluster project Theseus in germany... it is now tim to reveal web 4.0 a web iot operating system...
Can I be helpful to you?
However web technologies are increasing dramatically in use by these trends, but did never get a major upgrade during that time... so we invented Web 4.0 two years ago an are now ready to do early access projects for web applications and iot. 
Our new Web4.0 development environment delivers a lot of value to iot labs which are being created around the world... we increase web developer productivity by factor 10 even for less experienced developers and enable their company to create intellectual property on reusable web components which can be dragged and dropped from one webpage to another seamlessly 
we are looking for more early access customers wo create a new web application or iot system from scratch and corresponding outsourcing delivery companies to jointly do these early access programs
