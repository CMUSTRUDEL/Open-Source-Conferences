Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: OW2con 2019
Description: 
	What is the value of open source for an organization, how does an organization influence it, what has knowledge to do with it. Although this will differ from organization to organization there are common topics this talk will discuss.

[Music]

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:16,949
[Applause]

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:21,029
yes and support is here from orange yes

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,609
I would like to speak about something

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:28,800
that is sometimes a bit hidden behind

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:33,960
all the technical backgrounds to explain

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:39,920
to the business that open source itself

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,899
is an asset and yeah here is the next

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,420
slide this is what I would like to speak

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,370
about as I'm technical by the way

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,600
readme.txt the that's the introduction

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,920
of myself I will speak about money and

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:03,059
why a contribution is equal to influence

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:07,140
what open source changes in the image of

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,979
a company and what that means for your

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,979
organization

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm Silverio Santos I'm working at a

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,000
subsidiary of orange that's called

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,650
orange business services more than 25

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,490
years of IT experience in business

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:34,229
I have larger active experience but with

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,310
the joystick in my children's time I

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,780
programmed

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,259
I sold computers I'm administrating and

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,860
I'm starting to teach to younger people

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:52,710
about IT I have a lot of certifications

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:57,570
in all possible areas including project

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:03,469
management which is scrum and I'm in the

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:11,700
orange group governance for seven years

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:12,860
so let's jump into what that means in

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,230
terms of

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,630
money is it really is is the value of

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:27,290
open source really only the equivalents

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:32,780
of avoided license costs to compare open

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:36,680
source with what you have not spent by

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,170
not buying closed source software is it

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,990
lines of code

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:47,860
comparing the Fedora distribution

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,860
version 9 these are figures from 2008

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:59,120
think that it's ten point eight billion

00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:03,200
US dollars worth of software is it is

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,190
that really everything no of course it

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,690
is more about the independence from one

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,510
supplier or from few suppliers and

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,430
dictating what you have to buy what you

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,880
have to think what you have to upgrade

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:26,720
to when you upgrade to the next major

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:29,450
version or not because the the file the

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,650
the contents that are saved into a file

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,640
is written in software you always have

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:43,970
the possibility to export your data if

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:47,299
it is saved at a site of a of a supplier

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,930
and you can export it and import it to

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:54,730
the next one that creates the freedom of

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,980
choice you can change the supplier if

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,360
the service from one supplier is not

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:07,250
good enough for you this is the real

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:11,140
value it is not easily translated into

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:14,390
money but this is a monetary value

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,450
because you because of the freedom of

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:24,530
choice you have a completely different

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:33,590
situation in requesting

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:39,350
in in discussing with suppliers so as I

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:44,290
said license cost is not everything but

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:49,220
we have costs involved with open source

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:51,320
the total cost of ownership in in the

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,440
total cost of ownership licenses only

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,750
one position and if you remove that from

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,830
open source in in the case of open

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:03,490
source there are still a lot of other

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:08,300
costs in front of you you should not

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:11,390
forget for example if you migrate the

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,050
example from before if you if you

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:18,080
activate your freedom of choice you

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:21,250
sometimes have to migrate then you have

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,460
a lower efficiency in the beginning

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,860
because you have to get used to it men

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,530
maybe the the workflow is different and

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,860
because the workflow might be different

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,310
you have additional training cost you

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,070
have the possibility this is a big

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:45,200
advantage you have a possibility to

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:49,100
expend to to spend money for someone to

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:55,520
create new functions if this is sorry

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:58,669
and if this is created in your company

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,860
or created by an external company these

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:09,830
are costs and what you should never do

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:14,120
is exaggerate because it will come out

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,850
people will get known will will know

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,150
about the exaggeration and that costs

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:26,060
trust and the trust is then transferred

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:32,620
to the open source software next topic

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,620
is contribution is equal to influence

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,510
what what does it mean let me explain it

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,890
in

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:44,410
whole structure so imagine you

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,320
contribute you can contribute in many

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:50,350
ways you don't have to be a programmer

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,870
but you can you can code your Co program

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,510
you need to have the coding skill not

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,670
everyone has that you can translate

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,520
software into different languages by the

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:03,960
way Microsoft Word was translated in

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,480
more than I think it was eight or nine

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,000
languages only after Libre Office

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,230
started to translate it into more than

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
30 languages yeah so it is it changes

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:23,710
the game just translating that that's no

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,540
no coding no programming skill involved

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:32,100
in here you can test as an end user so

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,350
this is more or less an analytical skill

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:39,220
but you will notice because as you use

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,400
the software you you are testing it yeah

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,890
and but you can do that in a more

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,970
structured way and this is another ended

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:54,750
analytical skill and you can also add

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:57,850
data you know OpenStreetMap Wikipedia or

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:02,950
open food facts which was founded by a

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:09,250
French guy Stefan G Gandhi so if you

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:13,960
contribute you do community work if you

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:19,060
do community work you have influence in

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:22,900
the project and the influence itself is

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:28,480
a contribution and now forgive me the

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:32,320
basic command go to start the influence

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:36,419
is not unidirectional the influence goes

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:41,650
from the contributor into the community

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:45,730
but the community influences the view of

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:50,310
the organization and the organization

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,310
can then adapt there

00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:58,960
future decisions on what the community

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,690
tells so if the community if you see for

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,610
instance that a specific function

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,810
function will not be accepted by the

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,620
community why should you invest time

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:16,990
money programming into that function

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:18,940
better would be to explain the new

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,920
function you would like to contribute

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,290
and then start programming and it if if

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,380
it doesn't have a chance then it would

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:37,300
not be a good contribution so what are

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:44,710
the results of those activities new

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:47,350
functions better functions you influence

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,590
the product lifecycle directly not

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:54,970
indirectly there isn't it it's not the

00:09:50,590 --> 00:10:01,540
result of a survey you answered you

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:03,970
really directly you can exactly directly

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,250
invest into one specific function by

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:11,500
pumping your money into that function

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:16,630
not into buying the next release of a

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:24,430
closed source software so in the end you

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:30,730
are in control this is this is a word I

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:35,230
heard from mattock hall the president of

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,390
the Linux International yeah John meadow

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,470
called he told me that in person I asked

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,680
him after a talk and I explained what

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,330
can I do in a in a big company that has

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,330
a research and development contract with

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:53,080
Microsoft and he said use open source

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:56,290
why because you are in control

00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:02,260
yeah so this is not for me but I would

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,569
like to forward that to you all ok so

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,139
next topic

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:13,480
what does that mean for the image of an

00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:21,040
organization and knowledge and

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:26,620
experience is what fundamentally shows

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:30,310
and proves the image of a company it is

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,250
important for business because you have

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:37,240
access to the open to the to the source

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:42,540
code which is open you can deep deep

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:47,110
dive very deep and create deep knowledge

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:52,600
it is possible but not necessary you can

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:57,339
contribute to the projects so you take

00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:01,629
part in the meritocracy which is if you

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:06,160
do more things if you do good things

00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:09,310
then you are better heard it is a proof

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,500
to put towards customers that you know

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:17,649
what you are doing it is not well

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:21,220
believe us no it is a proof an exact

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:26,730
proof and which is also a business

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:29,949
differentiator it attracts good people

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,459
this will be one of the biggest

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:37,540
challenges in the future to have good

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:41,620
people to do to do good jobs and to be

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:46,209
ahead of the others who do it who are

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,220
doing the same so what you build in the

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:53,319
end is the most important thing you can

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:56,019
have as an organization trust if the

00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,990
customer does not trust you that you are

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:01,629
doing things well they will not give you

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,120
their money they will not give you their

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:08,949
time they will not give you their

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:12,130
dedication you can a technical a

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:15,190
technical example is revery reproducible

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:20,710
builds which was an idea

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:25,300
that was implemented by debian they try

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:29,850
to to recreate the build process of a

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,620
software package to prove that the

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,840
software source code which does not

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,720
contain spy software which does not

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,140
contain anything you don't want to have

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,320
really translates into the binary

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,380
executable

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:49,780
this is reproduce rapidly usable builds

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:54,130
difficult world and as I said before it

00:13:49,780 --> 00:14:00,370
proves instead of believing the leaflets

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:09,930
the posters the website marketing shiny

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:13,060
marketing things we get everywhere and

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,070
this is an important thing with open

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,980
source you can you build trust the most

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:22,450
important ring so what does that mean

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,080
for the organization let me ask you a

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:29,430
question

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:34,920
or a few is it okay to use open source

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:39,280
to save license cost think for yourself

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:46,270
is it okay to make your company appear

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:50,980
to be modern just to improve sales to be

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:54,160
modern yeah or to be cool whatever is it

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,310
okay to use open source to follow a

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,980
management concept because the new CEO

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,050
says we have to do this yeah this is hip

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:07,480
this is cool everybody does it we have

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:12,370
to do it so I tell you why not open

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:16,540
source is ready to do this and a lot

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:20,740
more because open source is mature which

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:26,800
we heard yesterday in the morning open

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:28,700
source can deliver value to the

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,390
organization and that's

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,770
what we call an asset it is a value for

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:43,040
an organization you can with with open

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:46,400
source you can find people heads for

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,760
your company you can empower them give

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,650
somebody a piece of software and in his

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,650
hand and he can change the world and

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,460
build an internal open-source

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:05,590
organization to foster to increase

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:11,120
momentum of open-source adoption

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:16,180
