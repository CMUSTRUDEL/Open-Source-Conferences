Title: OW2con'18 -Towards user-centric security for computing over clouds-of-clouds - arc Lacoste

Description: 
	Multi-domain infrastructures from clouds-of-clouds to edge and fog computing have become leading widely-distributed systems. While aiming at end-to-end and software-defined management of computing, storage, networking, and device resources, such infrastructures still face major security and dependability challenges. They also still have to address acute interoperability and lack of unified control concerns. User-centric management of security for such infrastructures allows overcoming several such barriers, with benefits such as full customization of security, control being either shallow or reaching deep into infrastructure layers.
This talk will present the approach explored in the H2020 SUPERCLOUD project to build user-centric clouds (U-Clouds), security being managed independently from single providers over multiple clouds. We will show how to build customized U-Clouds hosting secure computations, selecting the needed security services to match user protection requirements. The SUPERCLOUD computing framework includes a core virtualization infrastructure to run multiple isolated U-Clouds over several providers, relying on low-level security mechanisms, and a self-management infrastructure orchestrating security services within U-Clouds to realize a la carte distributed cloud security, also monitoring overall protection, notably extending results of the OW2 VESPA security monitoring framework. The talk will finally provide insight on some remaining challenges and research directions ahead.
