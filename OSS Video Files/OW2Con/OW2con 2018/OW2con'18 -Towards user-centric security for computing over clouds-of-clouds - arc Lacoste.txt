Title: OW2con'18 -Towards user-centric security for computing over clouds-of-clouds - arc Lacoste
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Multi-domain infrastructures from clouds-of-clouds to edge and fog computing have become leading widely-distributed systems. While aiming at end-to-end and software-defined management of computing, storage, networking, and device resources, such infrastructures still face major security and dependability challenges. They also still have to address acute interoperability and lack of unified control concerns. User-centric management of security for such infrastructures allows overcoming several such barriers, with benefits such as full customization of security, control being either shallow or reaching deep into infrastructure layers.
This talk will present the approach explored in the H2020 SUPERCLOUD project to build user-centric clouds (U-Clouds), security being managed independently from single providers over multiple clouds. We will show how to build customized U-Clouds hosting secure computations, selecting the needed security services to match user protection requirements. The SUPERCLOUD computing framework includes a core virtualization infrastructure to run multiple isolated U-Clouds over several providers, relying on low-level security mechanisms, and a self-management infrastructure orchestrating security services within U-Clouds to realize a la carte distributed cloud security, also monitoring overall protection, notably extending results of the OW2 VESPA security monitoring framework. The talk will finally provide insight on some remaining challenges and research directions ahead.

[Music]

00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:10,980
good morning to all of you so my name is

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,710
Marco coast so I'm a senior research

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,500
scientist at orange labs and I'm a

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,470
technical leader of the H 2020 super

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,430
cloud European project and today I'm

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,380
going to talk about this project that

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,000
has been going on for the past three

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:35,610
years about this user centric view of

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,180
clouds of clouds security so what is the

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,570
project about so the project is trying

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,600
to to work on a number of hurdles of

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,579
cloud computing mainly you you know that

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,170
the cloud computing has a lot of

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,629
problems mainly about interoperability

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,629
about security and about lack of control

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,539
over users mainly because the

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:05,100
infrastructures are very monolithic a

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:08,400
lot of attacks and the problem of vendor

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,560
lock-in and so for this when we started

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,659
out about the project we felt it's about

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,990
where was the need to to change the

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,060
vision from a provider centric vision of

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,450
cloud security to a user centric vision

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,049
of cloud security and this is what the

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,850
super cloud project is about is about

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:30,930
giving the user back control over

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,270
security independently from the cloud

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,610
providers thanks to a mediation layer

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,810
which is called the super cloud based on

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,009
original ideas by IBM decoupling

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,110
production of cloud resources by the

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,229
different providers to their

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,780
consumptions by users in order to be

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,149
unable to fully customized cloud

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,640
security and building you what we called

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,670
user centric clouds so there are four

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,950
main challenges and principles behind

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,070
this of course security has to be

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,619
self-service to be fully customizable it

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,890
has to be overall so self-managed the

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,770
key problem of automation in order to

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,200
overcome sheer complexity in all layers

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,690
from compute data network

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
it has to be end to end think about

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,989
encryption algorithms there are wide

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,989
wide ways to protect data user centric

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,629
with proxy encryption or storing data in

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,920
the cloud how you do you give

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:33,060
homogeneous experience to protect data

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,980
and also the problem of resilience based

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,830
on the data availability in a multi

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,900
cloud context or in order to to be able

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,650
to protect network virtualization

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,069
virtual networks in a multi cloud

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,080
context so this is what super cloud

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,450
computing is about and it gives

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,790
increased customized ability to users

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,760
independently from the cloud providers

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,980
and it also in opens new business

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,870
opportunities so the project is a

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,780
consortium across a number of countries

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,870
it was led by technical which is an

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,530
Austrian semies technical lead was by

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,540
Orange

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,940
and the architecture work package was

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,840
led by University of Darmstadt and then

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,859
there were three core work package from

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,280
virtualization by Orange

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,940
data protection by IBM networking by

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,940
University of Lisbon very cutting-edge

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,190
work by asta to min Telecom and also in

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,010
order to validate the framework by

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,130
Healthcare Partners Philips and metadata

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,620
which is a leading actor of healthcare

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,600
in in Portugal so the project has been

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,519
going on in three years and if you're

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,690
interested please do not hesitate to

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,940
check the project website so super cloud

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,280
is a vision it's also a framework and

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,359
two and a security framework to manage

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,420
these resources really in a transverse

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,700
way from computing that a network in

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,950
order to build the abstraction that we

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,709
call with user centric clouds these new

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,660
clouds and thanks to the super cloud

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,109
mediation layer we are going to be able

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,690
to build this and to deploy and build

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,709
and run these new clothes for a number

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,680
of verticals and for

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,169
a number of customers for instance the

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,069
healthcare the blockchain financial

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:32,110
market telecom industry and this opens

00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,419
in turn multiple exploitation paths and

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,190
in the project we focus mainly to

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:39,430
validate the framework on the healthcare

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:44,220
market but there are also many others so

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,599
a bit bit of word about the vision so

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,740
super cloud is a security management

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:53,800
plane and it's also modular plane with

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,220
frame so it basically the the framework

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,830
is a set of components and we've tried

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,830
to decouple in order to be able to be as

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,560
modular as possible to compute plane the

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,639
data plane the network plane and in the

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,620
cross-cutting manner the self management

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,800
in order to build this new cloud

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,990
abstraction and basically we try to

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,060
reconcile two opposites to self

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,569
management of security for automation

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,800
and the self service of security to give

00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,539
back user control of security

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,409
independently from the from the

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,180
providers and also the two opposites the

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,180
control over security in the private

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,120
cloud and the lesser control but the

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:42,039
greater scalability that enable what is

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,020
enabled in public clouds so this is an

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,570
overview of the of the super cloud

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,009
frameworks a very number of components

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,070
that have been developed by the

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,889
different partners so the framework is

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,909
open and the idea is to be able to build

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,530
your secure you clouds you assemble them

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:02,349
according to the to your security

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,110
requirements so on the computing plane

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,500
you will find a number of components to

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,320
achieve a distributed virtualization

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,449
across providers to build to run you

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,150
cloud virtual machine or containers

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,490
independently from the providers you

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,490
will find components also to isolate to

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,199
provide them strong isolation based for

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,949
instance on hardware technologies such

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,169
as Intel SGX and also to manage virtual

00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,139
machines or containers for self

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,599
management of security for computation

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,840
for data protection you will find

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,639
components for replicating data in the

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,639
multiple cloud context to guarantee

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,550
resilience you will find resilience

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,529
distributed storage and also security

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,770
and privacy enablers for instance

00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,990
attribute based encryption libraries but

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,139
we also have libraries for a security

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:59,620
duplication of data and finally for

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:03,370
network management one big challenge was

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,460
how do you manage how do you can you

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,870
define based on security user defined

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:14,560
requirements virtual networks across

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,610
clouds and then you deploy them so there

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,469
is a network hypervisor and Orchestrator

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,870
which allows you to do this which is

00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,229
called serious and then on top of this

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,969
were a number of resilient services

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:31,349
based on software-defined networking to

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:34,629
provide resilient networks and also

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:36,400
security services for secure network

00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,529
monitoring in the multi cloud context

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,750
and also for security service chaining

00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:43,389
and cross-cutting all of this you have a

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,909
number of security self management

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:52,210
service across compute data and network

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:53,860
so some of the major results are the on

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,539
the core technology of the release of

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,960
the the super cloud framework and some

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:02,560
integrated demonstrator on some products

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,430
of the of the partners basically around

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,770
two main use case one was healthcare

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,349
laboratory information system by

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,569
produced by medics data in in which we

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:15,969
integrated a number of components and

00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,490
the other was the cloud-based medical

00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,800
imaging platform by Philips and then we

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,020
unified them into a single demonstrator

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,089
over I think it was five cloud providers

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,460
running in about the same number of

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,399
countries so really a multi cloud

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,419
platforms running on many countries in

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,329
order to be able to identify and

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,519
integrate those different components we

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:45,820
have have inter international visibility

00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,820
also with over 40 high quality public

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,780
in major security conferences and also

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,670
we organized in order to test our vision

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,640
workshop at the your C's major systems

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,980
conference also organization of a summer

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,970
school and security and trusted

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,580
computing some integrated demos also to

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,800
the project advisory board in which for

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,930
instance various Intel some

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,740
contributions to open source of course

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,790
or w-2

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:19,420
but iBM is also in the project and with

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,950
the hyper ledger hyper ledger fabric in

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,010
which a number of components have been

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,260
from the project have been contributed

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,290
such as an ordering service and so there

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,050
is this ecosystem which has been a

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,360
vector of transfer of the technology and

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,820
which is a very active and so

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,950
exploitation plans and cloud brokerage

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,280
healthcare and blockchain market and

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:46,390
also startup on Yanis technology which

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,190
is stuff let's say user centric storage

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:52,120
for multi cloud technology which is

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:55,570
issued from the project so now I'm going

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,480
to quickly focus on the computing plane

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,790
over the multi multiple cloud so it's

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,010
just one part of the of the framework

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,320
and so without going into too much

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,500
detail basically we have three main

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,360
challenges the first is virtualization

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,790
virtualizing and running very virtual

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,390
machines and containers seamlessly

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:20,110
across multiple clouds and be able to

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:23,380
manage them isolation and Trust for

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,390
instance secure multi provider enclaves

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,840
and how do you manage integrity and

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,730
Trust and so self management with all

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,280
those services and how do York is trade

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,920
them and back with a balance between the

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,350
provider and the user control over

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,960
security and so for this our response

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,820
was to lay your infrastructure at the

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,800
bottom a distributed virtualization

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,150
infrastructure and at the top an

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,820
autonomic security management

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,590
infrastructure so just the focus so you

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,750
will find all the details on the project

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:58,740
website I'll just give a quick focus on

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:01,350
here you have the an overview of the

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,360
the framework so you will find again at

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,020
the bottom the virtualization

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,630
infrastructure so with on the right how

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,610
do you run the you clouds so two main

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,450
challenges that how do you orchestrate

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:18,089
the you clouds seamlessly across the

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,270
multiple clouds and in order to be able

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,940
to run security services co-located with

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:28,080
your VMs or with your containers but

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,660
also deep into the layers of your the

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,110
infrastructure and for this we enhance

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,180
the micro hypervisor gen Odin Nova in

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,899
order to have control over security deep

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,060
within the layers and also components in

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,430
order to have high security with

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,310
benefits of Intel SGX technologies and

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,890
cloud FPGAs and on the top a number of

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,110
components for self management for

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,320
instance for security monitoring your

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,730
infrastructure managing SLA is

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,920
authorization software trust management

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:04,170
or replicating data based on geo geo

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,720
location which is particularly important

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,649
to have guarantees based on location of

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:16,440
data in a multiple cloud context so I

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:18,540
will just give this is I know that time

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,370
is constrained but this is a component

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,740
we have been developing which is orbits

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,110
which is the virtualization components

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:29,220
and basically it allows you to run you

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,740
cloud as a code and the idea here is in

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,390
two lines is you specified on one side

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,000
the elements of your infrastructure to

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,740
build the multi cloud in Tosca and on

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,649
the other side you you specify the

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,209
security services also in Tosca both in

00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,060
the computing plane in the data plane

00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,800
and in the cloud and in network and then

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,500
you blend it using aspect oriented

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,990
programming in order to be able to under

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,180
reach the template so we build a net

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,270
effect Weaver for this and this allows

00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,750
you to deploy intern these templates on

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:05,790
the multiple cloud so we started using

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,459
hot deployment engine or also with

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,590
Google Cloud and so in order to be able

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:15,670
to really have a portability and in

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,130
durability and also we extended this to

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,930
two vertical orchestration for

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,000
monitoring and this is really the link

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,260
with one of the our w2 project with

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,060
which is the spa for monitoring we have

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,040
two challenges the virtualization

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,760
infrastructure of super cloud is a

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,630
nested virtualization and basically that

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,000
means that you have three levels you

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,220
have to provide your infrastructure you

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,990
have the user control virtualization

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,270
infrastructure which may be docker

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,430
containers for instance and then finally

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,830
you have virtual machines or containers

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,070
and here the challenge is how are you

00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,090
going to monitor all those layers across

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:04,270
the layers also based on what the

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,300
provider can offer you and horizontally

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,580
how are you going to reconcile the

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,920
monitoring information across the

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,430
different providers so cross layer

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,280
monitoring and cross provider monitoring

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,230
in owt - we developed a few years ago a

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,840
framework a self-protection framework

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,810
which is called vespa but has been an

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,960
architecture that allows you to do this

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,310
and so we enhanced it to take into

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,940
account those requirements also

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,760
integrating provider level monitoring

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,570
information also defining a REST API and

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:45,760
so this allows us to provide this

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:49,320
enhanced monitoring component there is

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,400
also some ongoing work to extend vespa -

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,170
to mitigate side channels and this is

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,770
really ongoing work in in the past few

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:04,690
months and so here the idea is in two

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:08,100
lines is to mitigate threats in this

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,530
complex infrastructure you will have

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,680
containers and you will have also

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,680
malicious containers that can collocate

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:22,270
with target containers and try to

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,420
extract sensitive information and visca

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,870
due to vulnerabilities either in the

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,450
verge

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,460
infrastructure or in the hardware in the

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,980
core and this is the side channel

00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:39,400
indirect flow of information extraction

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:43,040
and for this you have the attack vectors

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:47,540
either in the core in the processor

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,180
cache or in across a cross core in the

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,450
l3 cache and so without going into too

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,150
much detail we can use vespa to mitigate

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,430
this in the cross layer fashion either

00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,620
with changing the the mapping of the

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,500
containers between cores or in a

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,950
distributed manner moving containers

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,920
perhaps from one machine to another and

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,590
in order to we have developed some

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,520
detection method and the reaction method

00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:19,310
to do this so to conclude some key

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,710
takeaways super cloud is really a vision

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,860
and framework to enabled user centric

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,940
self management of security across

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,010
multiple clouds for compute for data

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,710
protection and also for network

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,600
management in turns it creates new

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,220
business opportunities for several

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,220
verticals of the ecosystem for

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,060
healthcare for cloud brokerage and also

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,520
for a blockchain

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,650
and more verticals may be supported

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,600
because super cloud is an open framework

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:52,490
and so we're investigating also further

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,770
verticals actually so thank you very

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,770
much and if you want more information

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,170
please do not hesitate to contact the

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,170
super cloud team and also you will find

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,030
more information in vision paper that

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,560
has been published at at the I Triple E

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,180
and which is available on the super

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,579
cloud website thank you very much
