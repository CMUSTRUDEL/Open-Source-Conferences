00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:16,350
so just in introduction or few words

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,260
about this presentation because we have

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,260
chosen to make this presentation today

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:25,109
even if this platform this a chemos

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,769
platform is very younger so it was a

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,710
little bit too bad but we hope that you

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,719
will welcome also this kind of new

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,790
initiative a very new very young

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:42,750
initiative the idea is really to show

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,379
that we need that as a as a telco as a

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,230
telecom operator to have a unified

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:57,210
platform for our development in

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:59,910
artificial intelligence so if we look at

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,549
different phases and stages around the

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:08,520
story of RT of AI which is that we had

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:13,500
different different aspect but one

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:18,140
significant progress was made since the

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,750
beginning of the last decade through the

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,020
arrival of a new way of developing an

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,979
algorithmic with machine learning and

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:32,390
deep learning with where we are in a

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,570
capacity of having a combination of

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,820
neural networks which is a basis for

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,579
machine learning and deep learning it's

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,329
also about evolution of hardware was the

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:50,670
introduction of graphics processing unit

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,640
what what we call G GPU which and I want

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,030
you to make so it's it's process for the

00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,140
gamers first but it's also process for

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,990
machine learning and the third aspect is

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,759
about the fact that we are also in a

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,940
capacity to too many plate to deal with

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,870
millions of what we call lateral data so

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,460
it's not

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:22,120
data because that are we ever we have a

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,900
lot of capacity to deal with big data

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,480
and and so capacity to have this that

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,420
are available but here we are speaking

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,950
about labeled data which are data where

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:40,900
we are don't put meaning and that can be

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:45,370
in that can be used for this machine

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,030
learning and deep learning algorithm in

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,130
addition we have where you are in orange

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,820
premises today and we have this message

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:58,990
from our CEO Stephan Alicia about the

00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:03,370
fact that he believes with the group in

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:06,090
the faculty believes in a I am and you

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,010
think that there is a kind of momentum

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,020
so we say we said we are the decisive

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,940
moment in history in term of innovation

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,100
right and this sort of potential in all

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,519
feet so that means that for telcos

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,700
really it's really something we consider

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:26,590
very seriously and just I don't want to

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:31,590
go in detail but just to 2 cm and to an

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,590
example of what zero straight aware that

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,620
but on part of the slide with this kind

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:46,330
of move to capacity to to deal with a

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,910
number of topics and to have also this

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,250
possibility to for instance in object

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:56,950
recognition to to have a significant

00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:04,120
progress as an example from our Viva

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:09,040
technology demonstration so in 2017 if

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:15,370
we look at what are the target domain

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:18,660
for a I am and it's not only something

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,040
that we consider as orange but it is

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,980
widely shared by with other operators

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,670
we see that it covers more less all the

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,340
domains of the operator of the telco

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:39,310
theater starting with of course in front

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:41,500
of our customer soon the customer

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,350
services and support which others the

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,540
first segment and you know we have

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,990
something which is a I think I would say

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,210
in progress and we are relying on the

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,330
solution we have developed especially so

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,490
this virtual assistants with Jingu have

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,960
developed together with Deutsche Telekom

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,780
so there is also the spirit of

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:08,980
cooperation at telco level for the

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:12,540
marketing engagement so it is about the

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,980
capacity we have to to make

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,470
recommendation for our customers so they

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,290
have an offer and they change our

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,480
behavior so we see and we detect from

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,670
the exchange of behaviors that they

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,419
could have something more interesting

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:35,230
more adapted to their to their needs and

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:39,220
their habits then it's also about what

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:41,650
is our core activity of course which is

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:47,190
around network and cloud infrastructure

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:50,800
and here there is a very wide range of a

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:55,300
function we can improve with by

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,510
introducing AII these are example but we

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,560
see that you see this symbol for a 5g

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,740
and on the right part of the slide is a

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:10,260
already important because with what we

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,640
have to consider is that the growth of

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:18,400
networks in ten Mohs scale in term of

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:23,440
complexity will be also extended with

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,600
arrival of 5g because there is a 5g is

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,530
not only a question of throughput it's

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,890
also a question of use cases a question

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,580
of ability to define for what we call

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:40,099
slice so

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:44,750
to assign some services with SFA's

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:48,710
associated essays to a type of supply of

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:51,650
of customers in a limited timeframe so

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:56,090
it becomes very specific what we call

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:58,099
on-demand services and for that needs

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:03,080
and for that kind of application we will

00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:06,039
need some improvement in our way to to

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,490
manage our network and especially

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,430
through the fact that we will speed up

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:17,030
we will speed up the services will speed

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:21,190
up usages and we will be more and more

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:25,419
in real-time mode and the only way to

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,849
face the challenge we have with this

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,819
constraints will be to introduce AI in

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:37,539
order to have more automation and to

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:40,279
avoid to deception for for our customers

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:44,229
security is also another aspect of

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,229
course and more and more important

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:52,430
especially as we learn now in the

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:55,400
business of banking but for all the

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,550
services we have we're looking very

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,699
seriously very cautiously at security

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,759
and once again AI can be very useful to

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:09,500
add through 12 sorry

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:13,729
for instance the fraud detection if we

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,740
look at the vertical application in in

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:21,560
order price market so we see that there

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,599
are a lot of business line we can pin

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,449
which can be addressed and improved once

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,539
again by by AI and we are looking also

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,430
this are only example but many example

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:37,699
better we are also looking at this kind

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:40,909
of applications maybe last just to to

00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:42,760
give you some insights about the

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,080
evolution of the assets and extract from

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,339
the report from in McKinsey

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:55,500
which shows the fact that today or it

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:59,100
was in 2016 the previous period so there

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:05,339
were numerous and investments were

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:09,779
speaking about yes around 40 billions

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:12,360
dollar of investment but only 20% of

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:16,709
adaption so that means that we are not

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,730
yet at the level of expected level or we

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,620
have not met yet the promise of

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,260
artificial intelligence so I think in

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,760
orange what we want to do is ready to

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:34,380
develop something not to be in in the

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:38,270
behind in the in the trend but just to

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:42,240
improve for our customer through AI

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:44,580
technologies way I method our service

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,750
season and that as I mentioned that all

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,350
level are all part of the including the

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,920
back office with a network and and

00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:07,170
demonstrate that we will have better

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:10,529
services with with that yeah as we have

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,170
seen that the there is a lot of

00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:16,829
investment but fortunately 20 percent

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,470
then why there is this low level of

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:25,020
adoption then here we have classified

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:28,170
the barriers for the adoption of AI the

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:33,600
first one its lack of unified framework

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:36,420
for AI the commercial department on

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:42,050
solution mainly focused on speech image

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:44,610
processing more internet and web player

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:48,690
services or service or for what the

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,029
internet players then there is no

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,370
critical mass in the area of AI for the

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,700
Ted Cohen term of communication

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,350
networking

00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:03,400
services and they lost last barrier it's

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:08,230
also deployment of AI it's remain

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,770
difficult for the operational team take

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:16,600
into account now if we look to the the

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:22,180
different marks AI framework here a list

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:25,990
of some most important frameworks we

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:29,910
have some property frameworks like the

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,440
Watson we have also a lot of open source

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,210
frameworks and toolkits like tensorflow

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,780
for your network see NTK from Microsoft

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:43,840
Amazon's I have also a mix net

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:47,830
Facebook's by Tosh and Kathy - but of

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,350
you can see from this overview that they

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,590
are fragmented and they are limited

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,950
limited the durability between this

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:59,980
framework there is some progress on the

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,070
center ability we have now recalled

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,790
high-level libraries like Kara's which

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,910
is a high level library for tensorflow

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:13,930
cindy kaye agree on also its current

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,820
high level library for CNT kmx net now

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,020
in terms of durability at the model

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,270
level recently they there is a new

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,410
standards published by Chronos

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:29,110
organization called and nef neural

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:34,270
network change format and permit if we

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,840
adopt a framework to interchange your

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:41,230
natural framework between different

00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,730
toolkits second one also it's a new it's

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:48,990
announced by three main players Facebook

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:53,440
Amazon Microsoft's called the onyx or

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,910
annex for open your network exchange now

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,840
there is some progress in tournament

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:03,709
ability but still solution are in silos

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:09,850
and limited in terms of theater ability

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:14,690
now in order to position telco and this

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:17,230
in this demand and we created the in

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,029
open source project called Akuma's a I

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,769
it sound out the links foundation and

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:26,870
what we call the LF deep learning fund

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:30,910
fund it's a group of project at all

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:38,329
there is only a queue was the activists

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:41,389
he was not in it's not a development of

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:43,850
completely new solution it was already

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,970
the decor of the solution developed

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:50,899
between AT&T a tech mahindra during the

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,899
last two or three years and that Seyi

00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:57,800
decided to open sources the solution

00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:02,839
under the Lynx foundation to answer the

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:05,300
the the barriers presented before then

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,620
akima said so for a kind of

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:13,389
harmonization across the different AI

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,759
tools and technology it's so far also a

00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:22,490
complete solution to design services to

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:27,829
shane models also its offer a way to

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:32,569
share the design module and solution

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:36,470
within a marketplace and at the end an

00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:40,790
easy way to deploy a module designed and

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:45,170
in this platform mainly thanks to the

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,860
micro services concept orange is a

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:52,759
founding member with AT&T tech mahindra

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:56,930
and also other company they have joined

00:14:52,759 --> 00:15:02,569
this initiative like Nokia reddit right

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:06,279
is 88 and sent and the wrong way now

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:12,350
concerning the simple journey for the

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:14,040
accumulate I then he must propose now an

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,519
integration of

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,220
if libraries and Twitter kids

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,759
h2o our cloud ticket learned to surf

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,610
flow and Java machine learning library

00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,550
and it's this library are already

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,529
integrated in innocuous and the first

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,790
step it's what we called modular let's

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:38,240
say to select the right algorithm and to

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,329
onboard this algorithm in the platform

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,449
during this onboarding we we create

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:48,899
micro-services of this model we packaged

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:53,209
in a docker image on the curve and we

00:15:48,899 --> 00:16:00,300
put it also in the repository then say

00:15:53,209 --> 00:16:05,040
the onboarding phase we also create a a

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,529
format for this model using Tosca

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,610
language the Scots language developed by

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:17,120
Oasis and used for SAS orchestration

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:22,110
services then here we use Tosca to

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,300
simplify the composition of the sea of

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,889
the model in the design studio and the

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,230
first part we import the model that

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:30,660
second one its second role it's the

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,510
analyst analyst you want to create the

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,600
AI application then the there is a

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:42,089
design studio in order to to Shane to

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:46,110
compose different model on board it on

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:48,149
the on the platform shorten during the

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,170
onboarding or design I can decide to

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:55,350
train my my model fits trained and it's

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,810
ok if I want to do a train for a

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,089
specific that I have possibility to to

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:05,480
train before to publish to the

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:10,130
marketplace the marketplace it's a trick

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:13,829
database in which we we store all the

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,709
model or the solution and then it's

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,770
exposed to any users through the

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,860
platform and then the user can select

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,420
the model or a solution and then can

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:30,730
deploy it in in a simple way

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:35,650
and on running platform position

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,630
Akim us and we we have now five

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:42,840
libraries but maybe we can also include

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,840
additional libraries like spark or other

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,360
as I said that we are able to create

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,900
this acumen CI marketplace by a

00:17:49,360 --> 00:18:03,840
composition of models and solution also

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:07,090
we can train this model solution on a

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,710
runtime and cloud infrastructure then we

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:15,100
have possibility to export the model

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:20,020
solution on a OpenStack or or Amazon or

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:23,230
Microsoft Azure cloud then sure that

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,810
when we it's trained and we can put it

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:30,990
again in the indicator and at the end we

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:35,140
can deploy it on the operational runtime

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,080
around infrastructure also one advantage

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,640
of the people at such a duration which

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,280
means and for example this is an

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:48,640
instance for the orange Akuma's then I

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,660
can federate this with Nokia or another

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:57,190
affiliate bank or AT&T high level

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,790
architecture we have the five model and

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,990
the embodying designs - jewel mortar

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,020
validation in order to validate or the

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,500
security or the policy aspect and then

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:11,260
entity model dedicated to to operate and

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,590
administrate the the platform and sure

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:19,240
the api's to onboard libraries or to

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:22,090
deeply on a cloud infrastructure last

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,200
slide here and the screenshot I

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:30,060
presented a complete demo during the

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,660
Demeter that they are conscious

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,940
screenshot of the the supporter and we

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,919
have the marketplace model and per

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:44,259
screenshot it's mainly on the design

00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:48,119
did you then here we have some models

00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:52,629
and I decided here to change three model

00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,489
face detection apply privacy filter and

00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:57,220
then to have some classification on the

00:19:54,489 --> 00:20:00,190
the output this is a kind of shine that

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,009
I called a solution that I can publish

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:09,340
to be ready to be used by any

00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:13,239
operational team then the as I said that

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,100
the Akuma said there is a already first

00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:17,379
solution developed by AT&T tech neither

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,470
we call better ELISA that's available

00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:22,899
you can download it and test it and now

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:27,669
we started the community since March

00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:33,369
March 2018 and we decided to publish the

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:36,580
first release by November 2016 and if

00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:40,409
you are interested join us and you can

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,450
go through the the wiki or see website

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:47,940
thank you

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,940
