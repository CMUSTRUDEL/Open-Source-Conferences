00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,960
so my name is Fillie bhai and I'm a

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,299
technical project manager at the city of

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,940
Paris and I've been joining the the

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:22,410
looters development team about two years

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,680
ago so dealing and working in in a big

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:30,990
city as Paris brings many challenges to

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,420
face as you can easily imagine there are

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,840
a very large number of services that are

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,700
provided to the citizens it can come

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,420
from streets and public building

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,610
maintenance culture and education social

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,680
associations and many other issues so

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,170
we're facing the problem of many

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,410
proprietary and vertical applications

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,750
that are standalone and work all by

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,129
themselves and doesn't don't communicate

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,549
with others there are software made for

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,170
small cities that cannot fit such needs

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,700
as Paris can have where we're facing

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,720
potential of potentially millions of

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,930
users and the software once is done

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,420
maybe in doesn't meet that it doesn't

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,159
always meet the city's and expectations

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,460
by the time it comes out so we are also

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,070
facing low and decreasing budgets as you

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,640
know so we have to find a perennial of

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:42,229
an instance and and manage our costs

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,060
even though we're helped by external

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,390
integrators to to work in advance are

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:53,490
our solutions we have a small intern

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:56,670
team so we have to capitalize and focus

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,250
and very few but well-known technologies

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,570
and make the right choices and

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,149
everything and find a way to to

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,979
standardize as much as possible the

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:14,250
architecture and that can be largely

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:18,840
replicated so these are at this

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,000
challenges and more about Paris so I'll

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,530
covered a real short bit of history

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,180
because it all began in 2002 when the

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:35,599
choice was made to develop our own way

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:39,510
of of developing and in the releasing

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,010
websites for the 20 districts that

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,030
needed to communicate with their

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:50,160
citizens and and provide them with

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:52,380
online services so Paris decided to be

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,150
the first French public administration

00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:01,769
to release its own platform as a free

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:06,540
PSD software in September 2002 so by the

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:09,299
time in 2018 and eight sorry some big

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,610
sites have chosen the test to work and

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,950
provide their services with such as

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,340
material falsi our french weather

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,190
forecasts the notaries and the city of

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:27,810
Marseille Lyon has more recently joined

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:32,160
the users community and Paris was a

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,079
pioneer in open data in in 2010 in

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:42,359
France organizing many many events and

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:44,819
in 2015 it joined the EOW two consortium

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,609
and the April Association as an

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,010
enterprise member and the two years ago

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:57,000
it became a notable achievement mature

00:03:50,010 --> 00:04:00,750
project project so what is the test as I

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,160
told you the first need was to provide a

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,040
CMS

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:12,390
an easily administrable site to provide

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:17,940
users and citizens with online services

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:20,620
so it contains a dynamic document model

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,470
publishing workflows some search engines

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,470
news writer forums and other features

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:32,200
that are usually used and commonly used

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:36,340
for such issues and it's very shortly it

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:40,470
very shortly became a java enterprise

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,900
portal integrating with IT systems

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:50,730
business applications and authentication

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:55,380
management it once again very shortly

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:59,290
became a huge development framework

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,890
providing its core services many api is

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:07,000
to use and a large sets of ready to use

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:10,240
plugins it also provides the developers

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,320
with a code generator so there's no

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,790
white page complex and there's an easy

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,430
way to get started with eventual or

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:25,690
maybe potential integration or

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,870
architecture issues as i told you there

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:32,260
are a set of ready-to-use plugins very

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,230
easily also plugins of plugins which are

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:40,660
called modules and there are more than

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:44,590
500 available freely so what domains are

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,530
held and handled by the open source

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:52,230
software at paris so it can go from

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:55,419
democracy as well as for example the

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,600
participating budget maybe some of you

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,040
know it it's a way to for the citizens

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,740
to provide the the city with ideas to

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,560
try to make to make it easier and the

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,500
way of life make made an easier and more

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
comfortable in paris such as planting

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,580
trees opening boxing rooms and

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,220
everything for the citizens

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,460
public consultations with a plug-in

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,370
suggest I'll I'll talk more about

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,710
plugins right after information and

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:32,570
communication as well as I was talking

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:35,600
about the 20 districts websites there's

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,800
a web content management as well as the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,610
CRM which stands for citizens

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,500
relationship management and that

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:48,500
customer for us with privacy care there

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,990
are also reporting problems found in the

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,570
streets or maybe even Dell ISM that can

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:57,889
be reported for yeah some some web sites

00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:01,070
who held by duties as well as common

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,130
services various forums whichever you

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,190
want to interact with our citizens and

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,740
and collect their informations we have a

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,510
forum plug-in and to do this as well as

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,780
an appointment plug-in and I'll show you

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:20,900
more about this one tax collections in

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:23,000
lighters so more about latest facts as I

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:28,510
was telling you earlier there are more

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:32,240
than 500 available plugins and 200 for

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:36,620
46 or hosted on github or shall I say

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,310
maybe Microsoft github there are we've

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:46,039
gathered more than 300 kilometers along

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:51,830
15 years generating 1.6 million lines of

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:55,490
code of Java and we're providing 210

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,840
public business applications website

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:02,659
either on the extra or intranet for

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,409
internal needs and online services

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:10,010
running at the city of Paris more than

00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:14,240
600 lootus instance running instances

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:18,110
running all platforms into our data

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:23,240
center and we're mostly using an Apache

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:26,479
Tomcat with either mysql or mariadb

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,360
as a technical background all of it

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:34,520
online X of course and for zero euro of

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:39,320
lyft license so let me focus a bit more

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,380
about about the appointment booking

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,100
plug-in Daiya was in charge with for the

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,670
last couple years this is only one of

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,670
the 500 available plugins it's provided

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,640
with a bunch of modules that are used to

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,459
communicate with other plugins so it's

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,730
very easily and I didn't tell you about

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:08,149
this but you test is all about module 8

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:11,660
and modulating a development platform so

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:15,350
once you have your needs you can either

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,690
pick from the 500 available plugins to

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,990
make your own applications or if you

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,839
don't find anything or the the plug-in

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,300
that fulfills your need then you you can

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,040
of course for a car project and develop

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,740
it yourself

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,240
so there are more than 200 forms that

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,510
were using the appointment booking

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,300
plug-in within dozen operational

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,170
branches at city of Paris and last year

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,600
we gathered more than a 80,000

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:50,740
appointments which was an increase of

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:54,980
25% in comparison when way to South 2016

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,140
it's an easy to build plug-in the whole

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,940
documentation is available the readme

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:05,329
file is a is is complete enough and it's

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,790
very easy to in Destroy lies because we

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:10,310
also developed something called the

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,410
theme which gathers all the the

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,820
different dependencies that are needed

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:21,230
to have a proper appointment booking

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:25,399
management system so once you have a new

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,160
site to build just right or just copy

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,649
and paste actually the 20 lines of the

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,180
new palm

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:36,430
that that has the dependency to the your

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,470
theme and then you have your all site

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:44,920
ready to go our use of the the

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,829
appointment play again is is linked with

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,889
a mapping system so I'll show you a

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:56,350
brief demonstration after and I'll tell

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:58,629
you more about this so once you develop

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,819
your own sites as I was telling you just

00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:05,170
write a few lines for other pond and

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:15,660
override the configuration and you have

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:18,939
everything to go so as I was telling you

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,720
you have everything every part every

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:25,869
plug-in is a project by itself so it has

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,660
it its own pom and referencing to the

00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:31,689
dependencies and only its own files once

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,389
you release your plug-in it goes to the

00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:38,050
latest artifact repository repository

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:42,410
and once you want to deploy a new

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,259
website just create either

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,759
a fresh one picking out of the the

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:51,050
available plugins I was telling you

00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:55,370
earlier about or simply rely on on a

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:58,160
theme that handles this for you so once

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,949
you have your project web app either at

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,959
the site or the theme just assembly yet

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:10,730
I supply it with the MBI the NBN Lu test

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:13,550
site assembly and it does everything so

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,199
let me show you a bit of a demo here

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:21,170
this is the use of the 6th districts in

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:26,060
Paris which provides its citizens with

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,649
many forms - that can be used to take an

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,569
appointment with the public

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:38,750
administration either to instruct

00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:42,620
wedding files or ask for help in any

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,829
cases so let me show you this sir Here I

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,410
am

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:48,500
and the on the website where I can take

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:53,209
appointments to the with the 6th

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,689
districts of Paris as you can see as you

00:12:53,209 --> 00:13:03,050
can see you can either deposit a wedding

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:04,610
file or ask for a deal or take an

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,579
appointment with lawyers and everything

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,149
that are provided by the city of Paris

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,889
in this district so let's say I want you

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,880
to have an appointment with a lawyer I

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:20,329
just click on the on the form this

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,540
direction can be made either over there

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:27,170
as you can see there is no room for this

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:32,540
so these people are very busy let's go

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:37,069
somewhere else maybe here exactly so

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,230
here is the the appointment agenda where

00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:41,750
we you can see that all these slots are

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,329
filled already so let me click on this

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,519
one which applies to me and I just have

00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,829
to either fill in the form with my

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:53,809
personal information or I can also

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:56,240
connect to my accounts which is another

00:13:53,809 --> 00:14:02,000
plugin that we decided to integrate

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:04,550
and which is which helps in in

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,010
connecting to to my own accounts I can

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:12,050
have a single sign in service and that

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,770
fills the information that is already

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:19,670
known and validated and authenticated by

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:21,380
Polly connect once I've filled

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,880
everything I won't do it because they'll

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,950
be waiting for me

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,680
I just have to check my info and confirm

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,500
in the back office there's a way to

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,880
check the the full agenda and and see

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,640
all the availabilities change the

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:46,630
appointments possibilities it's it's a

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:50,560
very custom herbal freely administrable

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:55,040
you can just activate plugins to either

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,670
connect to some some database for the

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,130
authentication for displaying those

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,950
availabilities on a map where you can

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,860
either choose when to have this

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:09,290
appointment or where do you want to go

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:14,960
to this appointment rather than you live

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:17,480
in the south or north of Paris and it's

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,670
pretty much it I don't have time to show

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,810
you the back office but it's it's relied

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,660
on loo tests so it's very easy to

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:31,940
administrate at once again and fully

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:36,140
custom mobile so to finish we did all

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:40,490
this to fulfill and to meet Paris needs

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,850
as a huge city but we recently got

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,740
approached by a group of students from

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:52,010
the John Hopkins University in Baltimore

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,280
Maryland in the US there they wanted to

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:59,060
to freely provide an appointment booking

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:02,300
system for a non-profit and non

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:07,420
religious organization in in the u.s. in

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:09,280
Baltimore so this foundation provides

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,600
help for

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,970
citizens in need either drug Horlicks or

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,420
people that have problem integrating

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:24,860
into the society providing providing

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:29,360
them with services meetings and another

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:33,590
way to to make them participate socially

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,760
again so this group of students made a

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:41,300
proof of concept integrating the plugin

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,450
the appointment booking plug-in and the

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,400
OMG decided to go live with it

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:51,860
so it was saluted by the bloomberg

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,680
foundation that has decided to promote a

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,140
little bit more open source services as

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,310
well as retest

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:07,460
for further needs in maybe in American

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:09,620
cities or organizations I would like to
