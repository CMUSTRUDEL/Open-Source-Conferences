Title: OW2con'18 Keynote Public Code with Free Software: Modernising Public Digital Infrastructure
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Software is deeply involved in all aspects of the 21st century. It is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts citizens and public bodies, and Free Software is the key to secure the necessary digital and analogue freedoms. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has been working for this cause for over 17 years.

This talk will provide a brief overview of the FSFE's previous and ongoing activities to foster software freedom in Europe on the levels of politics, legal work with enterprises, and general public awareness. The speaker will then turn the spotlight on the recently launched "Public Money? Public Code!" campaign which aims at ensuring that public administrations have full control over the software and the computer systems at the core of our state digital infrastructure. 

The audience will learn why Free and Open Source Software is a crucial precondition to secure a healthy software market, individual civil rights, and our today's democracies.
