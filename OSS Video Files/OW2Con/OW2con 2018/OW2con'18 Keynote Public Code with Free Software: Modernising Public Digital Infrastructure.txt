Title: OW2con'18 Keynote Public Code with Free Software: Modernising Public Digital Infrastructure
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Software is deeply involved in all aspects of the 21st century. It is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts citizens and public bodies, and Free Software is the key to secure the necessary digital and analogue freedoms. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has been working for this cause for over 17 years.

This talk will provide a brief overview of the FSFE's previous and ongoing activities to foster software freedom in Europe on the levels of politics, legal work with enterprises, and general public awareness. The speaker will then turn the spotlight on the recently launched "Public Money? Public Code!" campaign which aims at ensuring that public administrations have full control over the software and the computer systems at the core of our state digital infrastructure. 

The audience will learn why Free and Open Source Software is a crucial precondition to secure a healthy software market, individual civil rights, and our today's democracies.

[Music]

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,200
good morning everyone first of all I

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,610
would like to thank you for the

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,120
invitation to this wonderful conference

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,119
and to have the honor to speak here as

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,140
one of the first keynote speakers my

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,630
name is Max Mille

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,269
I'm program manager at the Free Software

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,529
Foundation Europe and today I would like

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,210
to talk with you about how to modernize

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,480
digital public infrastructure by using

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,989
free software and share some experiences

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,160
and some thoughts and hope and the panel

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,200
discussion later we can catch them up

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,149
now I've been asked to quickly introduce

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,789
the Free Software Foundation Europe and

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:53,250
our work so these are a few of us we are

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,670
happy bunch of people but there are many

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,940
more all over Europe and a lot of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,090
volunteers who aim for one shared goal

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,600
we want to enable people and users to

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,360
control technology by using free and

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,869
open source software so when we speak of

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,369
controlling technology or the other way

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,759
around

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:22,170
how acknowledge e is controlling us I'd

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,890
like to use a simple partly sad partly

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:31,350
funny picture for that perhaps you know

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:34,049
this this is simplified scheme of the US

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,000
nuclear chain of command so on the way

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,630
we chop most people would think that

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,899
there's a president and he has the power

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:45,780
to push the symbolic red button to fire

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,460
up the nuclear weapons and well this is

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,820
really mighty and he's elected he's

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:55,470
responsible for it but now we know that

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:59,610
there's something else there's something

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,829
else namely the engineer or the

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,890
technology behind it to enable the

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,140
president pushing the red button that's

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,739
there another entity that we have to

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,390
take into consideration and that's where

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,920
control of technology comes into play

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,920
where we have to think of

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,900
out how we can control technology well

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,690
we are not bothering about the US

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,569
nuclear chain of command but all of us

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,050
we know that software plays and a very

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,810
important role in our daily lives and

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,510
that we should be aware of that so and

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,209
control of technology happens through

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,209
using free software through open-source

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,739
well how do we enable people to control

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,440
their technology I would say there are

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:54,120
roughly three pillars of our work at

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,519
fsfe one of them is community we are

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,470
representing users and developers we are

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,190
giving them a voice and we are building

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,400
a strong networks of people who can

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,319
voice their demands to different

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,410
entities to the politics to decision

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:16,489
makers ok another pillar is our legal

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:21,900
work we facilitate the world's largest

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:25,170
legal network of legal experts and these

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,630
are experts from many companies but also

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,340
individual experts and we are hosting a

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,730
safe place where they can exchange

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,530
thoughts where they can solve problems

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,380
collaboratively talk honestly with each

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,250
other and also create a change in the

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:45,299
whole ecosystem the third pillar is

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,160
policy we are pushing free software on

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,160
different policy levels from a very

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,590
small regional level and municipalities

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,049
and they are supporting initiatives up

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,760
to the European level and working

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,609
together with the European Parliament

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,730
and the European Commission to create a

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,160
political change and help with our

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,250
expertise and we are also building their

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,609
collaborative networks of organizations

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,350
of individuals to enable them to raise

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:18,750
their demands and to push for free

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:22,049
software now how do we do that what

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,990
kinds of activities do we exercise to

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:28,080
make this possible I've taken out a few

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,200
examples and one of them

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,320
concerns our thought that we should

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,900
always have a universal right to tinker

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,240
so if we have a piece of technology in

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,330
our hands and we bought this we should

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,890
always be able to tinker with it this

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,170
means that we should be able to modify

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,960
it to change parameters to have a look

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,660
into this technology and for example DRM

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,590
digital rights management or how we call

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,710
it digital restrictions management makes

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,810
this impossible and we educate and raise

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,380
awareness of the issue that DRM is

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,200
already far in the into our society into

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,420
our structure and every almost every

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,480
piece of technology that we can buy

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,530
ebook readers and so on so this is

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,380
something where we raise public

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,560
awareness another activity is more on

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,720
the legal field this is reused software

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,360
that's an initiative where we created

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,440
simple guidelines for developers for

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,470
companies how they should make their

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,290
code more reusable by following three

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,060
simple guidelines so this is again

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,340
something where we don't stand on our

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,650
own and very trying to reinvent the

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,660
wheel but this is complementary to a lot

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,600
of existing solutions that we see in

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,750
free software compliance like force

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,190
ology and open chain so again we are we

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,790
are trying to work together with a lot

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,180
of our organizations and initiatives on

00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:00,300
the policy side we have safe co-chair

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:04,310
this is targeting the current copyright

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,900
proposal in the European Parliament and

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:11,310
there we are targeting the article 13

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,490
which may impose upload filters on code

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,580
hosting platforms among others so this

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,810
may create a lot of issues there and we

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
are trying to work together with the

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,670
Commission and people from the

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:29,370
Parliament to solve these issues and on

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:32,330
the user side we have the free your

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:36,570
Android campaign so there we are

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,520
educating and helping users to create or

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,740
to make their Android phones as much

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,650
free software as possible first of all

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,430
by

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:48,639
just replacing a few apps and up to the

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,560
end to create it or to install a whole

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,270
new free software operating system and

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,870
therefore we gain control over

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,590
technology now these are a few examples

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,910
and before going to the fifth campaign

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,860
that I would like to present today and

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,050
the currently largest campaign that we

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,590
are running I would like to ask you

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,460
three simple questions so please raise

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,160
your hand if one of them applies to you

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,139
the first is do you finance the

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,010
development of non-free software on a

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:26,350
regular basis ends up do you do that oh

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:33,220
I see if your hands okay next question

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:37,960
are you forced to do so okay and all of

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:40,360
you do you pay taxes okay

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,280
now the hands go up okay I don't know

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,740
about you I mean here there are only a

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,410
few hands up in the first and second

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,500
question but I personally I could say

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:53,080
yes to all of those and while it doesn't

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,020
really bother me to pay taxes and I'm

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,400
completely fine with people wanting to

00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,789
fund the development of non-free

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,800
software regularly the combination of

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:06,729
all of these three points that I'm

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,280
forced by paying taxes to fund the

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:12,280
development of non-free software that is

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,990
something which really bothers me and if

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,970
you feel the same I have a good message

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,830
for you because I think we found a

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,900
solution and a good way how to solve

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:25,449
that this is our news campaign public

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,240
money public code and the demand is

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:31,000
really simple at saying that code paid

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,630
by the people should be available to the

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,029
people I put in other words if it is

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:42,339
public money it should be public code as

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:44,229
well so this is targeting newly

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,130
developed software so code which is

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:50,680
created by Texas and we want that this

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,180
code which is they are created is put

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,520
under a free and open-source software

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,600
license to be made available to the

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,279
people

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,730
to drive information now let's be

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,459
brutally honest this isn't something we

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:11,740
evolutionary but there are a lot of

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:14,050
people who think it is there we created

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,800
an open letter of which has been signed

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:21,430
meanwhile by 17,500 individuals or more

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,639
of them and the full number of 148

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,880
organizations and there are also some

00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,940
familiar faces hey-oh w-2 thanks for

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,089
signing well as I said this is not

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,750
revolutionary the idea that public money

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,889
should be public code has been there for

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,630
many decades and the issues that

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:46,690
reoffending proprietary software have

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,540
been around for a long time but why are

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,759
so many people and so many organizations

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,430
convinced that this is the right way to

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,500
go and this is now the right time well I

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,620
would say there are three reasons for

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,360
that first of all the message of public

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,160
money public code is really simple

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,439
the arguing behind it that public money

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,290
should be public code and what refund

00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:14,439
should belong to us basically it is so

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,750
simple and hard to argue with the second

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:22,839
reason is that although it's very simple

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:25,389
we can apply this slogan this idea to so

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,029
many initiatives all over the world to

00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:30,970
regional activities so if eyes and in

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,160
the ritual want to change my public

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,350
administration or my municipality to

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,620
free software cores or to the whole

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,660
world where we want to create worldwide

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,910
European write software strategies and

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,860
the third question is that I'm convinced

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,670
that this is the best time that we ever

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,449
had to push this topic because public

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,490
administrations seem to finally

00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:01,400
understand the issues that are created

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,810
by proprietary software but let's

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,370
take it step back I talked about

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,370
modernizing digital public

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,610
infrastructure what is this so I'm

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,670
pretty sure you all arrived today using

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,760
traditional public infrastructure by

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,500
using the bus by using trains by driving

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,420
on you're in your car on public roads

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,360
which you fund it or which people in

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,430
this country funded by the Texas and all

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,740
those traditional infrastructure

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,220
elements like education security

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,680
services data storage and processing so

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,970
storing where I live and calculating how

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,270
many taxes I have to pay but also more

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,610
specified things like geographical

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:46,160
statistics participation platforms like

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,740
our voting system and communication

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,790
these are traditional sectors of public

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:56,450
infrastructure but all of them are also

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,340
affected by digitalization and solving

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:06,430
these challenges with proprietary

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:08,480
software is really bad idea why because

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,280
proprietary software comes with a lot of

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,070
issues we have the lack of

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,230
interoperability we have missing

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,900
flexibility that public administrations

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,570
cannot use one solution for one problem

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,430
to another problem although it could

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,370
work basically all it needs just some

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:28,820
refinement we have a strong issue of

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,560
when doe login so that I'm dependent on

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,470
one single vendor which created software

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,410
for me we have the issue of long term

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,260
maintenance we have a low acceptance by

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,000
the public the people who paid for that

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,940
who don't understand where their money

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,930
is flowing in and how it is the software

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,440
is is helping them in many cases the

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,330
investments the money flows abroad not

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,510
in my region it's not fostering

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:59,840
innovation regionally but yeah helping

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,030
others and not my own economy and of

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,440
course as you all know proprietary

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,340
software comes with a lot of security

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:12,940
concerns and issues now by using and

00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:17,040
pushing public code we can provide good

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:19,330
solutions for these issues free software

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,580
mostly comes with open standards and

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:26,020
these make interoperability very easy

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:30,850
cooperation is a basic principle of our

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:34,750
community we have independence of single

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,880
renders we public administrations can

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,660
collaborate the same way that we do in

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,500
our in our community and therefore share

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,140
long-term costs and risks transparency

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,050
is also by default by having a source

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,850
code open we can include regional

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:58,690
providers and giving out or tendering

00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:00,460
single subtasks and of course free

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,640
software solves a lot of security issues

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,550
and has the potential to make IT secure

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:12,100
and these are the solutions that we can

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:15,280
offer well this isn't just dreamland and

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,320
some some regions public money public

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,830
code is already happening and I would

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,990
say Barcelona the Catalan capital is

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,720
currently the best example of public

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:29,830
money public code implemented the city

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:33,460
pledged to spend 70% of its annual IT

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:37,090
budget software budget on open source

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,460
software that's a huge number and they

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,680
are not only saying this and having

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,420
strong words but they are actually doing

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,120
it and changing the way how their

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,520
funding and creating software by

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,910
changing their procurement system by

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,520
including regional providers and by

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,900
having a strong will and a sense of

00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,640
understanding that this is the way to go

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,250
so from this good example and a few

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,800
others I would like to present you

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,830
quickly a few conclusions and a few

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,560
thoughts that I came up with how we can

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:16,510
push public code further so the one is

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,700
which we learned is that policies are

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,080
more important and more efficient than

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,810
laws they're closer to where we want to

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,620
act they're easier to create they are

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,720
not some apps

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,930
direct laws which go to Parliament's and

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,710
take a long time but they're easily to

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,630
implement this is something that

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,900
Barcelona did really well they came up

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,790
with a lot of guidelines and the

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,980
policies which makes it easier for the

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,760
actual civil servants to make public

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,560
health possible but we also have to keep

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,990
in mind to improve the procurement

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,080
system and to fix it it's not only

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,690
sufficient to say that all public money

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,490
should flow into public software but

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:05,170
also the procurement system has to be

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,880
slightly adapted to enable regional and

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,870
smaller providers to participate in

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,810
tenders and involve excist costs in

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,320
their bids so this is also something

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:22,090
where we should advocate public

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,550
administrations to change we have to

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,530
help them or to make them understand

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,680
that knowledge transfer is essential

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,590
that's really like common for the free

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,140
and open source software society but for

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,730
public administrations often the legal

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,530
departments cannot really speak to the

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,330
IT departments they don't understand

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,880
each other especially when it comes to

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,160
new topics like open source software and

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,890
there we should help them to make this

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,350
transfer not a stranger possible also

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,300
across borders and this is also already

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,330
happening that software projects are

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,770
developed by public administrations

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,770
collaboratively in different countries

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,200
and their share a lot of experiences and

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,210
risks and costs and also create a good

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,880
solution for many other public

00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,860
administrations and last but not least

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,640
we should support a cultural change in

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,130
those public administrations we have to

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,210
guide them to understand the principles

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:23,940
how modern software development works to

00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:26,680
be agile to collaborate that I cannot

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,520
order a software and have it installed

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,600
and then it's done

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,340
it's a continuous process and these are

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,850
all tasks and these are good points that

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,260
we can bring forward but well again

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,290
let's be brutally honest

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,950
I'm speaking here for the fsfe and we

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,440
are just a tiny tiny puzzle piece and

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,870
all display we cannot change the world

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,940
on our own but when I have a look in

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,920
this audience I see a lot of potential I

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,710
see a lot of people representing

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,220
organizations and interests and if we

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:04,220
work together and if we use this time to

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,550
exchange ideas to exchange knowledge to

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:11,000
build networks we can really make a

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:14,900
difference we can start making public

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,850
money to public code thank you for your

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,950
attendance

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,950
