00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:12,570
this roundtable is about open source or

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,429
free software and between its software

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,539
between values and value so I have

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:21,119
several questions but and I will open up

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,490
the microphone if we can have a mic for

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,060
boon for for later so we like we should

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,060
have ten minutes

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,920
maybe I should itself I think question

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,860
asked you Stefan or Bantam at those who

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,079
Evans have the opportunity to speak yet

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,660
if they have any feedback or any

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,260
comments on the previous speech or on

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,550
the seems starting with who wants to get

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,100
started it's different

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,719
well first of all thanks very much for

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,559
the invitation and also for the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,480
excellent talks we had this morning it's

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,399
ready quite interesting to see the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,350
evolution and as someone who was

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,119
involved in the open source and free

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,760
software community since the early 90s

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,400
I'm very very pleased of all the work

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,729
that has been done by all these all

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,090
these people and also as an entrepreneur

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,869
as someone who has founded a couple of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,659
companies based on open source on what

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,350
will still call some open source

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,710
business models but also some values we

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,880
think that we need to to stop it a

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,780
little bit and to think about what the

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,259
what are important these values are for

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,159
the success of a company and I see two

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,590
two major points the first one is

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,470
internal internal to your company it's

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,979
ready as you can learn in every

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,009
management book or lecture that it's

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,009
important that your employees shares the

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,890
values of the company so you have to be

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,860
very careful about what kind of values

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,530
and especially open source or values

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,940
that are somehow related to open source

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,810
such as openness transparency

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,510
Consensus you want to promote inside

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,520
your company and how which kind of

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,980
people you want to either to work in

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,830
your company so that the values are

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,470
still shared by all your employees and

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,830
the second part of course is all these

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,590
values are projected toward the market

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,580
to your to your customers so do your

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,590
customer value your values if they don't

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,830
want maybe you won't have a great

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:49,780
commercial success so you have to also

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:55,540
adapt and you have to also tell the

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,940
market to evangelize the market about

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,250
open source so that's what is a great

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,340
organizations I've been doing for the

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,180
last 20 years and that's one of the

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,430
reason we are so successful at least as

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,980
open source companies at pure open

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,500
source companies I'm not talking about

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,459
the third phase that you highlight in

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,620
your in your presentation which is a big

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,260
companies that are that have a very

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,280
different business model that maybe

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:31,090
don't share that much the values that

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,560
that we are discussing but as a second

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,830
wave as the professional open source or

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,390
commercial open source company founder

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,220
we are ready we think this is a very

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,640
important question okay so your point is

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,270
that companies that leverage in the open

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,190
source business model or leverage

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,400
implement the business models that

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,470
benefit from the possibilities offered

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,440
by the open source licenses and the

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:06,250
sharing of code etc to align with what

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,190
Simon's was we precise this company is

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:13,000
really caring these values they're not

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,730
just opportunistic companies that the

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,970
discussion that we as a community need

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,979
to ask we all know some some companies

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,840
or some people that claim the shared

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,120
values or the

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,860
claim even the clean clean some claim

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,139
they are doing open source and actually

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,430
it's not it's what some people called

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:36,700
open source or false open source but so

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,530
it's a different different point it yeah

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,800
there's the the values and then there

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:46,150
are ethical ethical consideration on how

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:51,240
to separate the grain from the Shafi if

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,540
you were Thank You pajama yeah the word

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,520
thanks

00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:01,300
I think it was yesterday at another

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,660
event which is Kentucky I don't know if

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,320
you know it's it's an event which aims

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:11,830
to together or people from lawyers and

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,900
people from paralyzation from research

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,310
centers from all the friends and I spoke

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,350
about

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,260
Lanois poon happy week me like I don't

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,650
know if you is his law is you are

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:32,289
familiar with it it's two years ago law

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:34,630
which aims at helping we improve upon

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:38,560
that are within administration and ask

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,460
all research centers to to use by

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,660
principal

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:47,169
open data and open source in all of

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,979
their projects say as I have to think

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:55,410
about open source and sometimes they can

00:05:50,979 --> 00:06:00,130
just do proprietary software it's really

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:02,919
new for them and the point was how can

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,729
they evaluate what they are doing

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:10,300
how can they gain money from software if

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,850
they have to do open source and I think

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,180
it's really it's always the same topics

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,400
we are speaking about from yours

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,780
everybody knows that free doesn't mean

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,510
gratis but now we have to do to look for

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,870
some matrix and to add them to

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,909
understand that even if they are doing a

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,640
pencils they are doing good stuff and

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:35,410
they can just evaluate everything

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,340
they've done

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,480
with maybe new metrics very specific

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,820
from open source development matters and

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:50,200
my point is we have to think all

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:53,680
together about the best material

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:59,910
methodology to to evaluate see it's we

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,910
can I think one one thing very new

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,110
everybody should know such a heritage

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:11,680
from INRIA so the big project leads by

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,770
Roberto de Cosmo this kind of projects

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:19,330
helpers to just to understand how our

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:22,450
project are used by people order around

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,840
the world we can try to automatically

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:29,950
said ok even if it's open source we have

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,190
I would say 1 billion users and maybe it

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,650
is something very interesting for your

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:39,310
organization your research centers and

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:42,730
we have tools I think about bitter gia

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,910
but we have lots of other tools which by

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,340
using such data can help us to

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,660
understand how what is the value of our

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:57,510
software and maybe by combining both new

00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:02,590
kind of data like software research and

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:06,870
tools like bitter Chavez or choose and

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:10,360
with a right methodology we can say ok

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,030
you're an organization from public or

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,340
private sector but doing a pen sauce is

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,100
something right for you and it's

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,450
something you can just evaluate you can

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,450
gain money you can just show your that

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,580
for you it which can be the state or

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,610
other people but you can show that even

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,280
if you are doing open source of free

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,890
software it's something good from an

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,190
economical perspective it's interesting

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,479
because you tend to mean there is one

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:46,030
way to defend open source to towards

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,180
mainstream and conventional

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:52,960
decision-makers is by highlighting the

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,420
the pragmatic benefits of open source

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,000
and I think we're losing were losing the

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:02,440
thing in the way I think this is

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,570
unfortunate development if you read them

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,910
in some of the richest stones will

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,620
thinks he's advanced the right to

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,480
freedom and the freedom has something

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,690
about ethical values so we have ethical

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,070
values that are no economic value per se

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm talking about an equal value but

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,200
sharing and to use the word friendship

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,490
about supporting the community and this

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,649
sort of advantage that have no cost you

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,470
don't put any pragmatic advantage and

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,730
yet a few years later when you reach the

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,620
cathedral in the bazaar that you've

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,660
mentioned Eric Raymond

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,300
mentioned I don't know I think it's page

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,510
65 of the Edition I have I've been

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,060
checking this he describes a world a

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,640
Darwinian environment ecosystem where

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,589
the developers are not working for

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,500
freedom or for the benefit of the

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,570
community they work for reputation for

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,420
scratch scratching an itch because I

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,700
need this and I'd my reputation so it's

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,370
very Darwinian in fact so there is no

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,959
I'm losing the the the sense of ethics

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,420
and and value there so what you've been

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:15,250
around from you have this perspective so

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:20,800
what's what do you think of this is this

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,589
working it is so it turns out that you

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,920
can't be a free individual without

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,440
freedom and that to do all of those

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,880
things that eric raymond writes about in

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,670
the cathedral and the bazaar and by the

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,520
way I'm not I don't support very many of

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,070
Eric Romans of political or

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,589
philosophical positions I have to tell

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:47,190
you despite being his successor as OSI

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:49,270
president in order to be able to be that

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,740
individual developer scratching your own

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,170
itch you need freedoms and the reason I

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,050
assert that if you want to apply

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,200
open-source to a new problem you need to

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,889
go back to your moral compass is because

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,350
there is

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:11,259
it there is a hierarchy of of needs and

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,689
philosophies here and without the

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,109
fundamental freedom to use and to study

00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:18,639
and to improve and to share the code

00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,949
you're not in a position to scratch your

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,169
own itch I think there is absolutely no

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:25,209
moral issue in whatever framework right

00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:27,220
no that's about scratching your on each

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,799
and building your own reputation this is

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,749
this could be totally immoral but when

00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,509
you try and do it on that basis you find

00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:37,989
you fail because it turns out that you

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:40,029
can't be free without freedom and Eric

00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,429
is somebody who has an extreme

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,839
right-wing point of view who doesn't

00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:46,239
believe that there is a such a thing as

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,499
society I fundamentally disagree with

00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,600
him I think there is such a thing as

00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,949
society but I don't believe it's so

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,829
strongly that I believe there is only

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:55,149
Society I believe that we are developers

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,850
living in society

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,089
and we have to find that balance we have

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,129
to guarantee I want my freedoms

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,819
guaranteed so that I can participate in

00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,759
society

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:09,249
I want my freedoms guaranteed so that I

00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,079
can build my reputation so that I can

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:12,989
build the software that I need I don't

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,179
think there's a conflict here but

00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:20,429
experience shows that if you if you

00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:23,259
forget values you fail a pragmatism

00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:30,220
pragmatism takes having values as a

00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:32,860
precondition with Erickson making the

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,699
decision to open-source l lang

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,360
with any hint of ethical values behind

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:43,269
this decision I don't know I was sorry I

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:49,119
can't help you there but at the time I

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:52,209
was working on the technical team and we

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,629
did not know how you could get Ericsson

00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:57,489
to open a kit our an open source those

00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,350
very much Jane who came in for it who

00:12:57,489 --> 00:13:02,559
convinced them that it would be a

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,239
benefit to them as as a benefit for

00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,519
developing a line and the system around

00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,739
it which they are which they were using

00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,799
they still are using in products and it

00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:14,470
would not cost them anything both in

00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,760
time and responsibility or something

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,460
like this for as well

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,540
as it happens I spoke to Jane about it

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:25,300
last week in Stockholm and yes Jane is

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,880
very passionate about Building Society

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,460
and have you isn't she

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,350
today she's an entrepreneur in in

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,320
building that she's creating startups

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,320
and investing in them and she is very

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,480
motivated to create a fair society by

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,530
the way her approach to her

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
entrepreneurship

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:48,340
she is very critical of money-grabbing

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,550
VCS and their bit that their tendency to

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,950
marginalize good-natured geeks that make

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,330
seems to make her very angry so I would

00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:00,130
say yes that was part of Jane's

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:02,800
motivation yeah I'd also say it could be

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,260
very different for a private person like

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,970
myself was a private person who who

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,270
wants to get their software out in the

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,550
world and for a company if a company

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,690
feels that their software is private in

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,550
the sense that if they were made

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,920
open-source and other companies could

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,150
use it in their products as competition

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
to it then of course they weren't

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,770
because that would cost them to do that

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,450
and I think that was one of the points I

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,460
was trying to stress here that that

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,470
seeing our Lang in the system rounded it

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,020
has nothing to do with telecoms as such

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,550
giving it away or giving it out would

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,900
not cost them anything in that sense

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,300
there was nothing there was none of

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,560
their products in it right and getting

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:45,810
back to the having open source for a

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,190
software as a private person as a way of

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,050
increasing your fame or whatever you

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,780
want to call it forth yes definitely I

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,730
mean I do open source software and I've

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,700
got no discussion about doing it now I

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,230
don't I don't have any qualms are doing

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,600
it but I very much like to have a nice

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,100
license which says if people use it they

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,540
can do whatever they want with it but I

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,610
still like to have my name there saying

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,860
so they can see so people can see that

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,810
they're using my stuff and I'm

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,100
definitely of course it's open source

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,900
that's not going to cost them anything

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,100
as such apart from just including the

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:20,440
license max to get back to the

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,540
expression Simon's expression of moral

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,839
compass which equals with my

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,930
questioning about whether this moral

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:35,490
values or ethical values in open-source

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:39,000
are being getting lost the fsfe is

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,399
probably among all us here the

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,970
organization that is probably most the

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,880
most the strongest promoter of ethical

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,420
values or meaning or the one that relies

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,300
most more or netiquette values than we

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,550
do it is something that comes across in

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,290
your activity or the connections you

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:04,230
have with people of course because I

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,779
mean many people still think that free

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,810
software are open-source I would agree

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:11,459
it's it's it's the same that you cannot

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,820
make money out of it you cannot make

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:17,910
economic value out of free software and

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,339
these are still misconceptions that we

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,190
face so we often have to explain that

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,490
that the the moral compass or that the

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,860
the ethics behind it is not competing

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,670
with the economic value behind it so of

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,010
course that's that's part of our work

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,990
when we're talking about moral values I

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,690
I struggled a little bit with this word

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,959
because it's really wake what are well

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:46,050
use after all ethical values but I'm

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,480
deeply convinced that you can combine

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,880
all of those like the economic value and

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,019
the moral values with each other because

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,610
it's not working without each other if

00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,399
company is is creating open-source

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:03,269
software it doesn't really work without

00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,100
having the the ethics in the background

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,780
or like the well use well ease of

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,280
cooperation values of sharing and

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,160
they're the former F is a vice-president

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,770
Caston calif once used a picture for

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,299
that he compared the different types of

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:23,669
people using or doing free software on

00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:27,770
the one hand there are miners people are

00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:30,780
just using open-source software but not

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,169
contributing back to the community and

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,770
then there are farmers people who grow

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:40,490
free software who give back

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:44,120
and to collaborate in the community and

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:47,900
I think this shows that you can create

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,540
economic value but only with having the

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,710
the software freedom values and and back

00:17:50,540 --> 00:18:01,070
of your mind it's different maybe I can

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:03,890
comment about this in my initial comment

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,380
I was speaking about values at the

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,960
company level so internal values and

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,440
values as they are projected to your

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,320
customer but it's also important to

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,230
think about shared value as an ecosystem

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,100
because in an ecosystem an ecosystem can

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:25,310
strive only if the development is

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:30,290
sustainable if as you said there are

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:32,210
miners that only grab value from the the

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,920
contributors and don't contribute back

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:40,820
to the the ecosystem the ecosystem will

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:43,040
probably eventually die out as an

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,280
organizational stand another concern as

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,030
generally lutetium which I'm co-chair in

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,240
France we've had I think five or six

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:57,590
years ago an initiative called shut Lib

00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:01,550
hopper free employment charter which has

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:04,330
been signed by maybe sixty or slightly

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:08,570
less than 100 companies in France and

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:12,370
it's focused on in some internal some of

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,680
these internal internal values so it's a

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:18,350
small it's quite short just five points

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,310
a small set of principle that every

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:25,400
company that I sign this discharge

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:30,440
agrees to implement in the company for

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,900
instance we allow our employees to you

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,090
the young the development environment or

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,650
the computing environment they wish

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,320
because we know some companies that

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,660
claim they are doing open source but

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,720
this the tell their employees you need

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:48,200
to use the corporate Dell computer with

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,389
Windows operating system maybe it's not

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,839
so bad after all

00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,969
but some developers really prefer to

00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:58,659
work with open source to work with Linux

00:19:54,969 --> 00:20:01,839
or even BSD or other other system

00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:05,379
another point was that this company must

00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,479
allow their employee to participate in

00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:11,529
open source communities I know a big

00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:14,429
French company which uses a lot of open

00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:18,729
source software and explicitly forbids

00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:22,089
their employees to even show up in open

00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:24,369
source online communities because they

00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:27,609
fear that some of the company will push

00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:31,409
them up so there are this is a set of

00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:35,829
very simple actionable principle and

00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:41,589
that are supposed to help our ecosystem

00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:44,200
to differentiate itself from other more

00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:46,299
general IT companies so there are

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,809
mechanisms to make business open source

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,029
compatible or open source values

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:55,749
miscible within businesses that's what

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:58,659
you mean we can reconcile some moral

00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:01,509
values or ethical values from open open

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,739
source that are so seven level yes and

00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:05,259
the business that doesn't care about it

00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:07,509
yes I'd say make them both work together

00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:10,509
in in resonance

00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:13,989
yeah there's very quite famous example

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:17,279
it's from the agile communities they

00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:20,679
have a very small set of four different

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,190
principles of values people of our

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,659
process working software over

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,809
documentation and so on and from this

00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:34,929
set of values there is a whole ecosystem

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:40,779
or as you say in English come cottage

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:43,089
industry of consultants or methodologies

00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:46,479
that have sprung out from this justice

00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:48,519
for principles to change the topic the

00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:52,509
reserve one was preparing this I came

00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:55,359
across some things and one perspective

00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:56,159
is to say that software being everywhere

00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,590
in our lives

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
software being

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,990
control even controlling maybe our lives

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,749
or at least our security depends and

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,059
safety of often depends on some software

00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:10,799
and one of the greatest argument in

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,149
favor of open source is that if software

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,889
is so critical in your life you should

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:16,470
be able to control it and to see what

00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:18,749
what you have in it but that is more in

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,789
terms it take technical approach to

00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:22,710
software but if I want to look at this

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:24,509
value thing because technical approach

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,009
has no value at all in fact but if I

00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,590
want to look at this from the value

00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,799
thing doesn't that mean that software

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:35,129
being everywhere should be considered as

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:39,539
I mean the road system or the air we

00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:43,669
breathe like a common good would that

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:46,259
work who wants have a take notes so

00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:51,269
Lawrence Lessig wrote a book called code

00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:54,869
once and he coined the phrase code is

00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:59,879
law the law doesn't actually matter very

00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:02,100
much what matters is the policies and in

00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:05,639
the software era the software that

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:10,529
implements the law and so your freedom

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:12,929
depends on the the the the faith facial

00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:14,429
recognition system that is spotting

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,309
cedric thomas coming out of the

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,990
underground in london is the software

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:22,200
that will cause cedric thomas to be

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,299
arrested by the police officer and it

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,220
doesn't really matter what the law says

00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,679
you will get arrested if the facial

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,440
recognition system identifies you as a

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,659
criminal and it will take you a lot of

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,759
effort to get yourself released again if

00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,399
the even if the software got it wrong

00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,320
and so what matters to the citizen in

00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:42,509
day-to-day life is not so much the law

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,240
the law does matter because it is your

00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:47,639
ultimate recourse to correct errors but

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,039
what really matters is the code because

00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:55,100
the code is expressing your freedom in

00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:57,749
day to day life and consequently I

00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,090
strongly believe that the code that

00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:02,299
could take away my Liberty should be

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,940
code that I have the freedom to study I

00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:07,889
think that it is improper for code to

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,779
control my Liberty if I am unable to

00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:11,820
check that it that it is complying with

00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,480
the law and so I think it is

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,320
fundamentally

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,720
to society that any code which deals

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,809
with the liberty of individuals should

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,320
be public code that it should be at the

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:26,549
very least republic lee readable and

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,250
almost certainly code that can be

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,280
studied and to which I can make pull

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,169
requests to correct the its failure to

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,600
implement the law properly so I think

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:39,840
this is a this is a key issue now this

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,660
afternoon here in Paris bondsman

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,470
mentioned it a little little moment ago

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,360
UNESCO are launching software heritage

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,970
software heritage is a is the Library of

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,010
Alexandria for the software age it is

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,820
the public archive and vault where all

00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,000
software can be stored and retrieved and

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,010
studied by its civilization I think it

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,460
is profoundly important that we get

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:07,740
every European government to put its

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,809
public code into software heritage so

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,380
that as citizens we all have a right to

00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:15,780
see it max I would like to just build up

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,210
on that I find this example of the

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,490
facial recognition really good because

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,380
there we don't speak about economic

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,600
value of open source or of software

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,860
anymore but here this is a political

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,650
question this this is an ethical

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,419
question and this is rare at least I

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,210
experienced that if talking to

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,120
decision-makers to policymakers we can

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,970
now bring back the well use of software

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,490
freedom to this debate because yes we

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,690
have those laws that we can recognize

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,580
faces in metro stations but then there's

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,960
the question behind it how can we

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,090
control it how can we deal with the

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,770
issues arising from that and this is

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,900
where we can bring a solution and this

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,640
is what I was talking today about about

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,500
public money public code that we have

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,380
public code which can as you said

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,290
publicly be assessed and and understood

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,080
and so I think this is a this is again

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:11,520
not an not a well you question by the

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,929
well use question Robert in Beijing yeah

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,150
I just had a comment I'm in another

00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:19,020
typical case of having code which

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:21,540
directly affects our lives making that

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,909
public of course is voting machines it

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,780
means a very simple case can I trust the

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:26,880
voting machine

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,280
that will actually count the votes no

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,710
you can't trust it because the code is

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,330
often secret so you have absolutely no

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,950
idea what's going on inside the voting

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,690
machine and it's been showing a number

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,110
of times that they can often quite

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:46,140
easily be hacked right and which you

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:49,860
don't want yeah yes I would say it is

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:54,420
very important point because we we spoke

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,820
about assets such as assets and the

00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,550
question was how to what what is a value

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,860
it's easy for proprietary software

00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:04,470
because we just have to count on the

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,960
number of patterns such it's more

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:10,110
difficult we're getting open source

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,040
software but when you are speaking about

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:16,950
Commons it's something else when it's

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:23,070
and another very interesting I think

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:26,790
actual moments Commons some open source

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,590
and free software are comments and when

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:32,940
companies or organizations or

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:36,030
individuals build Commons they want to

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,700
just to put some software or something

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,100
out of the markets it's not an assets

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:46,200
it's something we are sharing we are

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,920
building together where we have common

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,280
governance about it and we free software

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:58,110
is I think one of the key unsure about

00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:01,440
how to build digital Commons from my own

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:05,010
experience when we we fought about how

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,730
to do into intelligence artificial

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:11,430
intelligence we're getting low in France

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,160
we we had lots of private and public

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:17,760
sector organisations which wanted to do

00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,450
it and they said ok we come to search

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,000
database and search software run we have

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,640
to do to do it together because we won't

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,580
trust and any anyone we don't trust

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,920
ourself and we have to do it with other

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,520
people we have to just have governance

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,700
to be sure that we we can trust such

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,279
database and such wizard we

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,090
and I think when we we speak about

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,210
currents it's another aspect about value

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,999
but as software as an assets and

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,850
software Zuckerman's are two different

00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:56,879
things and very interesting yeah I think

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,980
there's a in evolution I noticed we

00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:01,980
started with software being a concern

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,149
for personal freedom Stoneman talking

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,669
about free a person right Simon you did

00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:10,830
point out that these rights were on the

00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,359
personal basis and then there's been an

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,159
evolution with the the growth of

00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,509
software and software eating the world

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,489
now we have software as a social

00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:22,830
challenge social challenge and all this

00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:25,649
software cannot be a software can become

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,259
evil and it's our responsibility as

00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:30,889
open-source communities to make sure

00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,929
that this software does not become evil

00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:38,129
at this stage I'd like to open up the

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,909
floor for the mic questions from the

00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:41,820
audience

00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:43,200
you have probably things to say things

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,149
to share I know there are a few

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,649
entrepreneurs in the room I know there

00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:53,700
are a few managers in the room you know

00:29:46,649 --> 00:30:05,489
there are few activists in the room can

00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:07,049
we have a microphone there now they're

00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:15,299
running out of microphones are there no

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:20,340
there there's one there yes

00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:24,690
I'm Ludovic from xwiki and I want to

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,789
rebound on something that that Stefan

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,720
said and mentioned success of open

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:32,789
source and I won't say I think we're in

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,590
a situation where we do see that there

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:37,070
is success for open source we have a

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:40,470
massive amount of open source code

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:44,429
however we also see a new situation in

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:47,789
the last few years where we we see more

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:50,779
and more companies that are using open

00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:52,590
source competing with company that are

00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,270
producing open source

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,700
and the companies that are using open

00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:01,250
source sometimes contribute but they

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:05,039
don't convey they keep as specific piece

00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:07,110
that they don't contribute and we can

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,630
see that in the successes in the last

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:14,580
few years and we just saw one now with

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:17,400
github the most successful ones seem to

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,010
be the ones that are using massively

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,740
open source the cloud companies for

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,990
examples that are massively using using

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,510
open source but there is a whole set of

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,610
software for which we have this

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,980
competition between those that

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,360
contribute so in the example of github

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,779
we can say git lab competes with github

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:43,559
one that is contribute contributing that

00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:46,380
little step more and get up that is not

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,120
contributing that step massively using

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,580
open-source but not contributing what

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:55,890
they do on top of it so how can how do

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,700
you an eyes this situation and how can

00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:02,190
we do and how can we control software

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,980
how can people control software if there

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,740
is always a piece that is not going to

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,289
be shared okay this is something where

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,210
I've been

00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:14,789
something I have experienced quite a few

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,159
times as an entrepreneur and also

00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:20,309
something that I have been trying a

00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,370
discussion that I'm trying to to build

00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:26,940
with the various communities I've been

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:31,860
involved with since the the creation of

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:34,020
the GTL era the city siena now i think

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,210
there are two different situation the

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,720
traditional one where you have an

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,970
ecosystem with mostly software vendors

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,140
and systems in tech integrators and in

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,440
the open source ecosystem the the

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,360
vendors can be individual for smaller

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,480
components they can be a doc

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,179
organization it can be foundations or

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,730
they can be professional open source

00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:04,610
companies like JBoss

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:08,610
or a single software or more recent

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:12,289
similar companies so these companies

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:16,070
produce either small pieces or larger

00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:19,549
components that can be reused by a

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:23,490
systems integrator to provide service to

00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:29,850
usually large companies or government

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:34,350
organizations and what what we try to do

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:37,620
as a trade organization is to have all

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:41,510
these players and especially the players

00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:47,760
in the French ecosystem to work together

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:52,039
to have well rules for the entrance so

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:56,669
that the the value is shared between the

00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:58,559
producers and integrators it's not easy

00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:00,630
because everyone of course wants to

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,990
achieve most of the value for themselves

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:07,260
so maybe the best way is to educate the

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:10,589
customer at the end customer and to have

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:14,250
them understand that if they only work

00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:19,079
with one big system integrators but they

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:22,290
don't ask for for them to really work in

00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,240
close partnership with smaller software

00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:28,109
vendors the system is not sustainable

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:32,760
and then there is a new new new issue

00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:34,740
that that you comment with your the

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,000
github example or many other examples

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,879
and it's the cloud provider the SAS

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,940
software as a service providers that are

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:52,500
really using a lot of observers

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:55,679
components and operating systems web web

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,990
services and and components for their

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,640
favorite programming language but that

00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,950
most some of them at least don't

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,579
contribute there are some that

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:11,320
contribute much more than others I think

00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:19,110
a good example in Germany is

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:22,090
and oh the the fashion fashion fashion

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,010
ecommerce site and they have an

00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,230
open-source policy which can be an

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,830
inspiration for other company that want

00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:32,890
to implement a similar approach and are

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:35,380
publishing some very interesting

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:38,800
components of course Google Facebook and

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:42,070
so on are doing the same but there are

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,110
other issues with them that I don't have

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,510
to comment of course and I leave the

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,700
flow to it the other speakers thank you

00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,500
is there any other question if there is

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,840
no the question there is one last

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,140
question and then we'd move on to final

00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,700
comments from our panelists and I just

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,870
want to address this right now Robert

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:05,350
just a slight comment to this so

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,820
open-source software is free but there

00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,860
is often a lot of work put into it

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,900
either by private personal by a company

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,720
so the question I think one important

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,300
issue is to work out how can you

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,870
compensate the providers the open source

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,340
they will keep doing it right but yes we

00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,080
have this set of values we want to

00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,050
spread what we're doing we feel we

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,240
should do this but it cost us the

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,520
providers it costs us both time and

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,260
money perhaps and things like this fall

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,030
so is there a way of providing it

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,910
because you sometimes you find companies

00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,910
that will take open source software

00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:44,410
which is free and then expect to be able

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:46,420
to use it and have support for it as if

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,980
they'd paid money for it they can come

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,450
back to the provider and say we want

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,370
these features don't don't drunk then

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,810
I'll come back a month later and say why

00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,250
haven't you provided us with these

00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,010
features and things like this for it

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,590
which is perfectly reasonable if it's

00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,060
software they're buying but now they're

00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,250
just downloading it for free and come

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,140
back with it and so just getting back to

00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,700
the morals again of how we're doing this

00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,070
and what we're providing and what people

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,380
expect would provide and can we work out

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,080
some reasonable way to compensate if you

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,300
want to so it's a question of if you

00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,870
expect the developers to work for their

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,600
ideal reasons then

00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,980
how do you make the system sustainable

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,750
yes how do you make it sustainable how

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,220
do you get the people using it also

00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,750
working for the same set of values or

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,030
accepting the same set of values and

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,410
supporting that memory it's yes some

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,120
companies do I mean this is not

00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,350
Universal anyway but some companies

00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,650
doing some companies don't we have a

00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:44,100
question to that question well comment

00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:47,880
yeah just a comment about this this this

00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:51,000
phenomena this thing is not new people

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,360
doing money without contributing it's an

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,810
our stuff but my own experience about it

00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:01,770
is we need to push about our own market

00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:08,610
our marketing because if you have for

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:11,340
example the ILS world is ruled Noble

00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:16,290
easy open-source and this is done by

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:18,930
having lot of people marketing on the

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,590
open source itself going to the

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:26,670
customers explaining why we should pay

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:30,170
more than zeroes and zeroes companies

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:33,750
just because they make such things

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:38,660
sustainable in long term so if you want

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:42,890
you to buy experience if you want to to

00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,250
to fight sous-sous enterprise with

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,200
companies that doesn't play the rules

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:54,080
you have to fight back explaining the

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:58,320
customers why they should place the road

00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:01,020
thank you ok final comments because we

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,350
have a clock here but in fact we need to

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,320
finish before the clock hits zero I've

00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,410
been told so this this has for this

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,940
panelist this whole discussion about

00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:14,850
about you know whether open source can

00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,740
survive if no-one pays it is such an old

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,510
discussion that is no longer relevant

00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,160
the only people it met that it matters

00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:24,270
the only products it matters about our

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,150
legacy products like open SSL where the

00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,610
developers working on it have that they

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,530
live there from a previous era and we've

00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,970
looked after many of the important ones

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,099
through

00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,050
project that is funding small projects

00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,270
like OpenSSL but today people are

00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:41,119
talking about github well I looked up

00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,220
what github is made from and github has

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,619
got a webpage called projects that

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,170
powered github and if you want to make

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:50,599
github pretty much everything github

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,190
does is an open-source project and it's

00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,070
an open source project that github are

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,180
contributing to and sustaining through

00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,099
their own developers or through

00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,160
contributions to foundations that work

00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:03,320
on the code github is not a taker from

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,140
the open source community github is

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,849
doing things the modern way they are

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:10,609
integrating the open source parts and

00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:13,460
what they are monetizing is complexity

00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,680
they are creating a complex system and

00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,590
if you want to compete with them you

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,190
have to hire the skills and build the

00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,630
value system and create the complexity

00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,869
that matches theirs and that's the

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,030
reason get the big it lab isn't a giant

00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:30,230
system it's because they haven't done

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,119
that they haven't hired all the

00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,490
brilliant people they haven't created

00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,980
the value ecosystem they haven't

00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,570
cleverly created many reasons to

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,720
participate and so if you want

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,250
open-source to succeed today what you do

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,020
is you build a business that's built on

00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,060
open source and there are many of those

00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,490
there's companies like Facebook Facebook

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,619
is all built from open source Google is

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,780
all built from open source and they

00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,359
contribute to the projects that they are

00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,250
built from that when they make new

00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:00,170
things in-house they release them as

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,300
open source that's where react.js came

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,490
from it was an internal framework in

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,349
facebook that they released to massive

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,990
benefit to the world so I think this

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:11,450
whole conversation about people being

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,910
net takers from open source is something

00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,890
that old guys like me think it's not

00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:19,810
something that anybody under under under

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:22,310
30 things in today's world companies are

00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,530
combining many open-source parts to

00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:28,220
create complexity that they monetize and

00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:31,130
that's the future of open-source thank

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,820
you I think briefly is different yes of

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,800
condemn one or the reason that these

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,420
companies are behaving the way they are

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,140
behaving is also because there is a

00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,720
shortage of talented developed

00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,750
so having the right values as I said

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,150
earlier but also showing your expertise

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:55,910
by having your own corporately sponsored

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:58,820
project like react or Google's pro golf

00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:02,380
angular or other similar project from

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,240
big bigger companies is a way to attract

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:09,170
developers and it's also a way to bring

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,960
third party is V or VARs into your

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:16,070
ecosystem for smaller companies like

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:18,460
mine it's it's a bit harder someone you

00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,470
mentioned also the influence of VC money

00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:24,680
before and with VC money it's quite easy

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:28,280
to to buy a community you can buy

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,880
actually on github you can buy fake fake

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:36,020
stars and fake Forks and fake on or at

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:39,560
least yeah fake contributions and when

00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:42,530
the customer uses these metrics as a way

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:46,750
to evaluate or or strongly your your

00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,750
your project perform it becomes an issue

00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,400
who's next

00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:56,020
pull final comments max yeah sure a

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,430
final comment um we spoke a lot about

00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,520
like I found this this comment quite

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,530
interesting that that we are we have

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,260
this this image of miners who are just

00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:09,970
using open source and free software and

00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:13,670
and not contributing back and I would

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:16,520
add to that that I encourage the people

00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,800
who are here in the audience to think

00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,440
about being free and open from the

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,690
bottom to the very top and I think this

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,700
this can really a marketing issue and

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,780
and something that we can bring up when

00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:32,120
when speaking to two people that having

00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,820
free software and having inspect about

00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,640
software somewhere that this is a huge

00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:42,320
benefit for for users and for the

00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:44,150
customers and I think we have to get

00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,400
better in advertising software freedom

00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,100
and and the freedoms at all and not just

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,390
think of of making money but also

00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,530
thinking of creating a market for open

00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,280
source and free software

00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:02,110
where we can put these values in thank

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,460
you Robert

00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:08,720
well I don't know if anything water add

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:10,310
from what I said I mean we are users of

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,840
open source software the company work

00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,970
for our Lange solutions that's based on

00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,620
open source software some of the things

00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,870
we do open source and some of the things

00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,600
are not depending on our customers our

00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:23,150
clients what they decide we definitely

00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,920
try and support if we can i I as I said

00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,130
I think this problem of getting support

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,710
out is is a serious issue and yes I need

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,230
many some companies do a lot of that

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:36,650
then there are a lot of just plain users

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:39,110
and if that doesn't go all the way I

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,000
think trouble for open source and free

00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,350
software it's a problem that needs to be

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,510
solved but I think there is a problem

00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:48,110
maybe I'm just be more pessimistic here

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:52,100
Thank You Emma when this work quick yes

00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:55,370
we say we are all here convinced by open

00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,380
source advantages and maybe the next

00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,480
step is because open source is

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:03,710
everywhere we we have to to build

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:07,460
bridges between people which who are

00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:11,090
using and warm confidence to burn sauce

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,490
and other people's who need to to make

00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:17,090
money who need to transfer technologies

00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:19,460
or all this kind of stuff because we can

00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:22,130
work together but we have to just find

00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,990
new metrics new new way of using the

00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:27,350
sauce in traditional I would say

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,720
business development and our stuff thank

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,250
you well thank you very much well it

00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,880
occurred to me that we've been talk

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,620
about values and and value and it has it

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,680
happened none of us has been talking for

00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,330
their own benefits but for the common

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,340
benefits because if we'd been in a

00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,230
proprietary world and we know that now

00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,840
today in software there is a purely

00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,490
proprietor word does not exist but say

00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,440
within the proprietary world with

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,450
proprietary vendors etc we'd be talking

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,920
not about values but about company

00:45:53,450 --> 00:46:00,020
culture and share all the value and yet

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,580
we've we've not been doing this we've

00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,440
been talking about values that we could

00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,570
all share together not for our personal

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,280
benefits so a more for the common good

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:10,420
so at least we are

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:17,949
changing something thank you very much

00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:17,949
