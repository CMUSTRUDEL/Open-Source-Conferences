[Music]

00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,269
and everybody we will talk you about the

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,929
physio I am project we are starting

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,740
right now this project started because

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:23,519
we wanted to show that the his solution

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,519
to do I am in free open-source context

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,189
and show to users that's the heart

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,399
solution but of course most of the time

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,340
those solution are several blocks you

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,290
have to assemble to get a global

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,989
solution so most of the time people

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,510
knows one or the other part of the

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,450
solution but they never see the full

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,450
scale of the solution that can be do it

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,379
can be done with open-source project so

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,809
the idea is to make an ie IM system in

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,320
the entity access management system with

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,559
only open source breaks so di I did

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,470
management system is a concretion

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,830
deletion provisioning user self-service

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,650
access management and lots of other

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,189
functionalities you can do with those

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,509
systems so inside you have of course

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,780
open LDAP open that one the most used

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,780
LDAP server when you talk about free

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,900
software it's the best deal license

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,509
there are several package made inside

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,030
the distribution there's also a payment

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,110
debian package made from the LDAP

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,240
toolbox project when you use the LDAP

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,299
toolbox project you always got the

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,090
latest version of the open LDAP server

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,759
package where several atoms like

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,250
overlaid like several several script to

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,200
do automatic backup and stuff like that

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,409
because the package in the distribution

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,409
most of the time are old and if you want

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,360
the fixed and the latest version there

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,750
has a nice community project that does

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,290
that it's of course Bix LDAP tree it's a

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,440
performance it's used by major companies

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,740
telcos so it supports a large amount of

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,860
data password policy of course one of

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,260
valet and you can do nelly everything

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,380
you want with it proxy method Hector hey

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,980
as I surpassed her to go to Active

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,770
Directory and so on then you have the

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,930
front end because when you have a nice

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,000
day you need to have a front end to

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,580
manage it and that's quite difficult

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,820
because you have lots of solution that

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,950
makes front-end from open LDAP but most

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,860
of the time they are specialized only on

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,950
some part of the solution and it didn't

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,590
give you only one interface to manage to

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,050
the world complexity of the

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,610
infrastructure so fusion director is

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,040
nice interface think for the users and

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,410
not for the admin see so the idea is

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,380
that this time we care about the user

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,590
the user of the software so it's it's a

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,350
GPL license it's written in PHP you have

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,680
a perm and debian package and as you can

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:19,620
see a managed lots of stuff mainly you

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,410
manage user groups a whole device system

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,510
deployment of system so the idea is to

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,480
have one interface to manage the

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:32,460
complexity of the IT infrastructure but

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,860
with one software that's a picture if

00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:42,990
you are interested I can show it after

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:45,780
the torque and I give to claim oh yes

00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,630
thank you banner as you noticed we are

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,330
200 stage so this project is a

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,130
unification of several communities when

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,800
I was working on fusion directory and

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm working on liminal App Engine and

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,630
other products and so we decided to to

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,480
join our forces to create this project

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,180
so inside this project we also have for

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,090
the auto technician parts free software

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,150
called eliminative energy which is

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,080
already on all the volatile project

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:27,820
this stack will manage the

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,280
authentication single sign-on and the

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,780
application and menu so you will be able

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,139
to have front-end phone for users that

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,110
allows to display to them all the

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:46,240
authorized applications so we are in the

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:49,620
web the web world and we can plug any

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:56,340
web application into the authentication

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:59,260
from a liminal pengie either through an

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,200
protection agent which is called handler

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,229
either through some standard protocols

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,630
like just salmon or OpenID connect you

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,740
may have you may have heard about these

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:14,710
protocols so this software allows you to

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,190
implement his protocols and to plug any

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,740
compatible application and this is for

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,639
authentication but also authorization so

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:28,150
you will be able to give access to users

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,430
to some applications so we saw that with

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,639
vision directory we are able to manage

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,580
groups and roles and this this

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,789
application will be able to read the

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:45,340
words inside a lab directory and to use

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:47,099
this force as an authorization rule it's

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,130
a simple screenshot of the

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:52,889
authentication portal so you see you can

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,050
display application of course only

00:05:52,889 --> 00:06:00,340
application available for the users on

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:03,430
this page here and you also some other

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,340
feature in the menu like a password

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:10,360
changing form like the login history so

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:14,590
you can see when your account was used

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,530
and from which IP ATT residue so it is

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,349
your authentication portal and it

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:24,660
protects all the application of your

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:27,670
information system another back-end

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:32,380
software inside of yeah

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:35,380
is a lesson which is a connector and

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:41,410
synchronization engine which allows you

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:44,440
to take the identity from your LDAP

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:48,450
directory and synchronize them to

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:53,020
another identity referential for example

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:55,810
we can work with Active Directory so you

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,640
can have your users inside Active

00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,650
Directory on open LDAP and Aven

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,890
automatic a synchronization between

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:08,440
those two referential you can also

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,410
imagine to automatically ultimate

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,410
automatically or create users or from

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,890
the human resource database so when a

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,560
user on toast into your organization it

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,280
can be automatically created inside your

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,780
directory and when in lives your

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,200
organization you can also be

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,510
automatically deleted so this is what we

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,690
call the identity life decision

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:38,770
management so you can automatically have

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:45,510
only equivalent inside your information

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:50,770
system see just simple technical tema

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:54,910
showing how is working the connector the

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,830
bigger a big part is to have a pivot

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,200
attribute between your source and your

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,140
destination your source can be anything

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,360
like that Abbas an app directory flat

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,910
files etcetera and your destination can

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,180
be also anything we also manage some

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:15,090
risk worst API so you can do automatic

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,090
here provisioning on a REST API

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:23,560
another simple software that we choose

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,110
to include inside the username is a

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,260
called web page so the name is a very

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,810
simple because it delivers some white

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,590
pages okay I think where we are very

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,590
good at marketing

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:43,730
the goal is to assume my obscene with

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:47,279
film directory it's a big interface

00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:52,920
designed for end users but with a lot of

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:56,520
a lot of features and we would we wanted

00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,470
to to add a simple application in a

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:03,529
read-only mode that can be used only to

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,279
display and search for data inside the

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:10,290
under giveaway if you want to have the

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,940
telephone number or the mail of a person

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:17,640
we we find that it would be better to

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,130
have a simple interface so here are a

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,980
simple screen shot we as you might have

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:30,120
seen here we put all Star Wars

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:33,270
characters in an LDAP directory with

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,960
their pictures and you can add a simple

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:40,350
search form and get all the information

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,089
about service characters from your LDAP

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,150
directory as this is an online

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:49,650
demonstration which is called staff page

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,510
and not white page and you can you can

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:57,960
just test this application and the web

00:09:51,510 --> 00:10:00,270
to see how it vapes so this is or all

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,790
this term August application are

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,570
standalone applications there are

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:11,400
different communities and we we want to

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:16,410
join them to create this project a few

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,480
million so the main goals for us provide

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,740
a full identity and access management

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,290
solution for the moment we know that we

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,530
can plug all this software together to

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,260
create a full container and access

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:34,459
management so both of us know that but

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,680
you don't know that so the goal is to

00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:39,330
make public that's the integration of

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,810
these softwares

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:47,820
can can bring a full solution we want to

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,860
have a pre configuration of each

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,130
component so you don't have to do the

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,430
work of configuring all parts and join

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,860
them together we will work on some

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,810
graffiti on the ocean and as we might

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,540
have seen you we have a lot of package

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:08,520
so we will ease the installation to

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,770
deploy directly or the needed package to

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,270
have the solution and we are working a

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:19,740
lot on a new feature a big new

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:22,710
presenting API for fusion directory we

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,400
have already an API but a new one will

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:33,960
is in development to be a forest REST

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:36,960
API we are in a lemon and up to 2.0 new

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,330
second factor feature you will be able

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,970
to a natively single factor

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,840
