Description: 
	Data from sensors / IoT require new frameworks to face to the flow of data coming potentially to a large amount of source of data.
A new generation of solutions has emerged to address this issue : the Time Series databases.
OpenTSDB, InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, KairosDB are examples that have been designed basically to face to monitoring requirements.
Warp10 is an horizontal solution totally focussed on time series for data from sensors, IoT.
Time Series databases have the most important growth. Beyond sensors and IoT, some consider that the traditional world of business transactions could be considered - and may me replaced - by streams of raw sequence of events. Everything - almost - in business and operations is going to become time series.
