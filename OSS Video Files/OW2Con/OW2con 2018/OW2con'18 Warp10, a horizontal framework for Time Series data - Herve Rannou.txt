Title: OW2con'18 Warp10, a horizontal framework for Time Series data - Herve Rannou
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Data from sensors / IoT require new frameworks to face to the flow of data coming potentially to a large amount of source of data.
A new generation of solutions has emerged to address this issue : the Time Series databases.
OpenTSDB, InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, KairosDB are examples that have been designed basically to face to monitoring requirements.
Warp10 is an horizontal solution totally focussed on time series for data from sensors, IoT.
Time Series databases have the most important growth. Beyond sensors and IoT, some consider that the traditional world of business transactions could be considered - and may me replaced - by streams of raw sequence of events. Everything - almost - in business and operations is going to become time series.

[Music]

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:14,580
so citizen data is five years of company

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:16,859
located in in Brest West France

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:26,420
so I'm sorry in Paris but the company is

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:30,349
a R&D team using in Brest yeah okay and

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:35,550
we have designed a solution named WAP 10

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:38,969
which is the which address time series

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:45,950
data and just just to have an idea who

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:53,539
is familiar with time series 3 4 5 6 ok

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:56,520
7 maybe so just to give you an idea of

00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,870
time so time series is technology to

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,460
mine our data from sensors

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:06,290
so we present Girona in a global

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,210
approach and time series among these

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:13,020
four different segments and the first

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,840
segments is what people usually knows in

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,820
in in data in data base which is a

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,040
relational database and relational

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:30,829
database now used to be dominant in the

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,240
2000 euros and to manage data from

00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:38,850
legacy application or for business

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:43,229
application and that during the

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:47,729
fifteen of our 20 last yes or the

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:53,060
technology as a match particularly no

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,060
SQL technology to manage data from

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,899
social networks or documents of

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,700
everything coming from Internet

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,920
including songs and musics and and video

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,200
but in that case when we talk about a

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,869
big data it's a big data as the

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,380
technology relates to analyze it

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:19,019
analytic suffers the content the

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:23,880
difference from time series comparing to

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:26,910
SQL a traditional relational database

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,080
it's in traditional database the key

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,940
data to arrange the data relate to the

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,560
business to the content of the data when

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,410
in time series data coming from census

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,400
the key data to arrange the data is the

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,150
timestamp so all those data are ranch

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:52,880
along the x term and by doing that way

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:57,390
you are able to cross any source of data

00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:01,890
so this this technology the time series

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,049
technology in database is it's the

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,670
technology in database that helps the

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:10,590
the most important growth today so in

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,190
the in the in the next few years we

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,269
consider that the comparing the volume

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,130
of the data the two dominant segments

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,859
are going to be easy

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:28,310
noise we are taking OG to manage songs

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:30,570
and video and the other is time series

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,630
data and store in time service

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,140
technologies today you have a lot of

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,410
project and people in which data from

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,310
sensors and IOT managed in traditional

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,110
database but

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:49,160
it's possible to manage this kind of

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:54,450
data in legacy database but it's it's

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,220
it's maybe it's there is no specific

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,790
problem if you don't have some in the

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,630
data regarding the trend of IOT and

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:07,170
census most of the application design of

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,300
this kind of replication are supposed to

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:23,070
change there are technology in the next

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:27,210
few years if tried ok just to understand

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,280
the evolution because the repulsion is

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:34,130
that we have start to mana data from a

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,620
census but we more we have projects and

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,410
what I have to say we are totally editor

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,900
we are a software publisher we don't

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,350
provide any specific professional

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,290
service we are horizontal editor in time

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,660
series technology and and we have start

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,630
by your managing data from sensors but

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,060
we are more and more demand for managing

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:02,340
other kind of data which I any data

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:06,600
related to an events and if we on this

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:11,210
slide it's just to have an overview of

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:15,120
what happened in January in in companies

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,620
by managing data in in traditional

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,150
database so they have a business

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,300
application and all these mistis

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:27,350
application manage their own database I

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,350
would say in in in functional serous and

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:36,210
to develop interaction between all these

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,389
zeros you have to face or

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:43,180
interoperability issues and the dream

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:48,699
and people have worked a lot on that is

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,949
the Semantic Web so by having a perfect

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:56,110
path to meet a perfect interval

00:05:50,949 --> 00:06:00,150
interoperability you would have to to

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:06,389
have interaction between all the data by

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,389
having a kind of global Semantic Web

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:13,900
regarding the content and of all the

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:19,659
data but we are on our side we consider

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:22,360
that's a kind of dream and if you you

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:26,800
have for example in IOT if you have a

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:30,759
look on all start up not only startup

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,599
but company working on on IOT business

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:38,069
so they they don't really care about in

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:41,919
about starters they develop their own

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:45,120
objects with their own functions but I

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:50,469
don't really care about interoperability

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,900
if they use some basic standards but

00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:55,750
they don't care about a world

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,469
interoperability like this represented

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,680
on the left of the picture on our side

00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:04,479
that we don't care about formal

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,539
description of data as the only

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,909
description of the data is not only a

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:13,949
time description of the data but time

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:16,889
and location Location want the location

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,810
exist so what we have developed is as

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,180
architecture which is Showtime series

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:27,219
architecture in which all the data can

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:31,000
be defined by time and location so you

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:32,349
have today different and specific in

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,040
open source you have different

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:38,160
architecture for time series but

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:45,720
the only real time series it's one we

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:48,360
have developed but today if we for

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,090
example we've if we take the the case of

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,430
smart cities and that's kind of use case

00:07:51,090 --> 00:08:00,000
we'll work on you have to cross more

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:02,940
more data and in historically all this

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,750
kind of data are managed by traditional

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:11,100
system and traditional database but if

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,860
you consider this this all this this

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:18,270
topics all these topics relate to a

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:22,290
limit re events so we we can consider

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,110
that all all what happened regarding all

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:29,130
this infrastructure relate to elementary

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,760
events so for us all of this is a time

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,860
series all of this so by considering all

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,450
of this with time series we are able to

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,610
cross anything and we are not by

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,380
considering every single time series -

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,160
for example - and to understand there is

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:54,120
an impact of what happened on one metro

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:59,240
line for example on on traffic or the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,560
opposite for example we first just I

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,890
would say mathematics or signal

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,310
processing we don't have to to to

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,190
develop specific application in

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:15,600
regarding the specific expertise in

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,200
transport it's just correlation or

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,260
different techniques to aggregate

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,610
different signals different stream of

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,460
data so our technologies can be used for

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,400
different kind of application traffic

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,380
optimization service citizen energy and

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,110
so on so you have different kind of

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,480
application which are going to use this

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,940
kind of

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,020
technology so behind this this

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:50,430
technology design at the origin for

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:53,700
sensors the evolution is to consider

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,680
time series not only for sensors but to

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,780
any kind of elemetary

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,910
events and for example we have

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,690
discussion with some companies they

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:08,400
consider in the future that everything

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:12,270
is going to become time series I'm not

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,180
going to give you the name of a famous

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:18,600
company but for example if you consider

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:23,010
a bank a bank his business is driven by

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,270
your transaction because the bank is the

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:29,190
business of bank is to provide and to

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,150
try to provide transactions but if you

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,400
take the industry or take utilities

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,070
telecommunications everything is even so

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:43,170
you can D you can consider that

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:48,930
everything can be defined or store the

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:51,720
data by using time series so on our

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:56,610
technology we often we we have designed

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,620
a library of 800 library with 800

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,530
functions and we have develop our own

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,350
language so what grip is a run we're

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,750
dedicated to time series so most of data

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,090
scientists for example use our Python or

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,700
language like that but for example to

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,010
give you an idea because it's totally

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,370
dedicated to time series where it is

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,010
going

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:25,980
once of the times faster than are around

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:30,660
100 times faster than Python so we we we

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,570
provide these functions to applications

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,120
and that's a way to go faster in

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,680
developing application so we deal more

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,330
and more with artificial intelligence

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,460
but we are not going to Incline

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,760
something within artificial intelligence

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,700
we take profit our of our technology by

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,770
using the assigned scientifical copies

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,050
of artificial and artificial

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,700
intelligence

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:59,590
mainly using tools like or library like

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:04,490
tensorflow torch or something like that

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:05,930
so just to be quick in this describes

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,820
the technology that the technology is

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,670
made of a two component one is the

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,370
storage component as the other one is an

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,910
analytics component so the storage is

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:22,340
the component is going to store any kind

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:25,850
of data so by describing kind of raw

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:31,220
data format which times demand and the

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:34,460
3d dimensions and we can store the data

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:40,190
on HBase by using HBase and we can store

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:44,240
the data on start alone on price and on

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:46,940
any system that support Java machine so

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,330
on the raspberry pi for example we are

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,000
going to ingest we are able to ingest

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:57,650
ten thousand data points just to have an

00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,690
idea we have a some clients with today

00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:05,770
more than 500 billion measure a day for

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:10,970
example OVH is a client OVH manage also

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:17,720
its own infrastructure by using

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:21,080
rotten and we have the analytics

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,290
component and the another component is

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,260
based on a vast grip with 800 functions

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,530
and everything is a stand doctor so you

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,100
can give you can define some parameter

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:38,210
to to define your own limits or what

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:42,740
some user able to do and by this

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:45,830
language we are able to over this the

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,510
800 function were able to deal with the

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,690
different existing framework on the

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:54,020
market or this framework adapt for some

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,680
functions but not are not universal for

00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,810
example untighten even we are faster

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,050
than on titan a lot of data scientists

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,300
use on titan so we are able to ingest

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,290
development of what has been developed

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,320
in our or Python or you can use spout by

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,950
Sparky's adapt for batch but not for

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,440
everything so graph it is going to give

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:27,089
you as the ability to manage all this

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:30,630
framework in a transparent way so the

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:36,390
analytics component obviously is going

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:39,630
to work on our continuum storage engine

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:42,690
but again it can work with any database

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,970
generally client has their own database

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:50,459
so we are going to plug our analytics

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:53,070
engine on their own storage so we can

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:55,380
drag it on a new SQL for example we have

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,200
discussion now with a record because the

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,839
record is interested maybe to use all

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,850
microservice one is interested to use

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:09,600
this technology in their own framework

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:13,529
in the owner selector so our value added

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,649
is not in in is not in the visualization

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:19,950
when people ask us to make a demo

00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,690
January we refused because our value

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,490
added is a engine it's not in the

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:29,279
visualization in for the visualization

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:33,270
we use existing component exists

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:38,580
available on the market so that I've

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:44,529
give you a word of that so that's it

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,529
