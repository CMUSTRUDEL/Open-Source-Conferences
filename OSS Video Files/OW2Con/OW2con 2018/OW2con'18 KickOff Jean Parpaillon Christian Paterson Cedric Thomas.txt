Title: OW2con'18 KickOff Jean Parpaillon Christian Paterson Cedric Thomas
Publication date: 2018-06-15
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Free software was defined a generation ago by the freedom to use, read, modify and redistribute the code. Yet these four simple rules have had the power to change the software industry. What appeared as an efficient techno-legal construct based on generous values of sharing and openness to efficiently collaborate on software development efforts has become open source software, a business model and a vehicle of collaborative innovation. OW2conâ€™18 will concentrate on the many faces of open source software, its journey between values and value.

between values and value and I will let

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,189
a Christian Patterson to introduce the

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,820
topic okay hi everyone and on behalf of

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,689
two days the ow2 annual conference and

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,210
it's great to see so many of you here

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,700
today obviously I know I think so more

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,310
people will arrive which is a will be

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,310
nice to see there's going to be more

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,000
than 150 of you here from five different

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,880
countries

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,330
you guys are representing more than 70

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,720
different organizations which is quite

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,870
incredible really we have organizations

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,720
such as French ministries educational

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:25,560
establishments industry finance

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,640
automobile engineering IT development IT

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,150
integration IT consulting and I think is

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,870
also one maybe two telco representatives

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,370
in the room and isn't that something

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,990
that's fundamental about open source

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:47,670
it's the bringing together of an

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:51,630
eclectic mix of passionate people to

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,150
deliver great IT but before we get into

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,320
that I want to do a special mention to a

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,880
few people

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,230
of course the ow2 management team who

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,920
have organized a great day

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,050
the hello labs auditorium management and

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,830
staff who've again outdone themselves

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:14,370
with this great location and also a call

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,680
out to Mary Sophie Colin from the orange

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,170
OLS communication team who has been

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,220
invaluable in helping us coordinate

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:27,420
everything so well done you guys

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:29,840
and thank you a big thanks I'd also like

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,130
to give a shout out a quick shout out to

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,489
everyone here who is concerned about

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,190
digital accessibility or accessibility

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,830
now some people here today have

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,090
accessibility needs so well done for

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,610
making it here it's not always easy

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,190
getting across Paris and it's your your

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,130
presence here is appreciated some people

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,590
here are working on accessibility

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,140
solutions and I find that really

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,140
inspiring that in the age of a movement

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,760
towards a digital society that open

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,940
source can be a dynamic that brings

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,850
communities together to enhance digital

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:11,250
inclusion and not create exclusion and

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:17,190
isn't that what the heart of this

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:19,799
subject is really about values this

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,460
conference is about values and the

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,150
journey that has taken open source from

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,130
its infancy and

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,240
to the forefront of take today's

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:35,310
technologies it's a dynamic that will

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,990
continue to drive put increasingly

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,639
visible and large proportion of

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:46,720
tomorrow's technologies and I think

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:52,270
that's really quite incredible but let's

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:55,600
remember two points open-source is not

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:59,139
an end State open source is not an end

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,080
goal is not your business model it can

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:05,440
be but generally it's not open source

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,370
above all is a collaboration model

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,930
that's founded on the principle and the

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:19,380
values of freedom it's a collaboration

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:23,770
model the is paid for financed through

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,970
various mechanisms companies and

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:34,330
organizations who provide paid developer

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:38,260
time or materials or rooms sponsorship

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,510
of events participation to communities

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:44,080
through community fees and of course

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,870
developers and let's not forget the

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,270
passionate open-source coders who work

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:57,849
sometimes that we can provide in their

00:05:49,270 --> 00:06:00,270
own personal free time and this this

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:04,120
participation to the open-source dynamic

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,590
it's not a P&L a profit and loss cost

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,070
Center it's an investment it's an

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:15,550
investment that delivers returns that

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:19,949
are tangible to your products to your

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,949
services to your solutions

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,430
and that's I think a valuable point to

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,440
remember so it's not about giving away

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,889
resources it's not about giving away

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,030
skills it's not about giving away your

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:42,040
competences or your time or your

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:46,850
materials for free open source delivers

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,610
it delivers technology enablers everyone

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,320
knows of course that most of the web is

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,460
powered by open source technologies

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,400
that's a given an obvious one but what

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,889
about artificial intelligence many of

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,050
the frameworks are powered through open

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:07,550
source technologies or core network

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,889
transformation something that's

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,789
revolutionizing the telco world at the

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:20,990
moment or service platforms or

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:25,460
blockchain or many other ideas such as

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,810
connected objects these enablers are all

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,970
provided through open source ok let's go

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,700
beyond that what else does open source

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,789
deliver open source delivers and has the

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,490
power to deliver sovereignty over our

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,020
digital landscape and I'm not just

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,240
talking about sovereignty over our data

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,740
which I think at the moment is something

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,900
at the forefront of everyone's thoughts

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,780
what with the various news that's been

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,639
happening over the last few months but

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,919
also sovereignty over our code and our

00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:00,639
technologies and narrow roadmaps and

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:05,180
beyond that open source delivers

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,160
personal recognition personal

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,470
recognition for the developers who are

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,889
working on open source and I think

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:17,830
that's great

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:17,830
after all human inside ok so

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:28,990
so these values enshrined by open source

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:34,579
allow people and organizations and

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:38,209
competitors to come together to work

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:40,310
together to pull their resources to pull

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:44,060
their skills to pull their knowledge and

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:48,140
materials in order to provide benefits

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:50,029
for everyone and also benefits the

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,140
visible of course within their products

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:57,440
and services and these are benefits that

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,470
would be impossible or improbable or

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:06,079
highly costly if they were done in

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,230
isolation so I think to wrap up what my

00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:13,700
opening message is here today is that

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:20,140
open source is a no brainer open source

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:22,820
delivers value because of its values and

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,040
I'd like to thank all of you here today

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,860
the guest speakers and also you guys in

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,800
the audience because it's because of you

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,709
that open source is great so I'm gonna

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,029
wrap up my talk there because I've

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,029
spoken long enough I've already taken

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,640
too long and I'd like to wish you all a

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,790
really great conference around open

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:49,040
source a journey of values to value

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:51,170
thank you let me get started I think

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,570
we're running a little bit late so I

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,450
wanted to illustrate the the journey

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,940
that's a degree two in once in one slide

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,620
in one picture first of all with a code

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,480
base we do a code base that's what you

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,730
have no right of your screen we're not a

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,640
lobbying organization when organization

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,199
that actually creates software that

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,949
produces software that makes software

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:18,529
available for the public for the economy

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:21,430
free software this software is developed

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:25,190
by a community in the framework of

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,560
activities all this is running smoothly

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,260
in the framework of an open source and

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,020
transparent governance and we keep

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,070
ourselves independent

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,529
so we have no allegiance to any IT

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,080
Giants or economic powers we're not

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,459
going to be acquired

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,080
we are totally independent we run an

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,610
independent infrastructure because our

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,820
members pay the fees

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,760
that's a w-2 but we started somewhere

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,310
ago and we owe everything to this

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,820
probably this mail that was sent in 83

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,860
by a Stallman and what I started saying

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,490
I'm going to develop a free operating

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,330
system that's original one in 83

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,110
that's Ghent more than a generation ago

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,140
ten years later

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,230
this mail the next mail came out and

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,560
this is a slaw the mail sent by the new

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,930
stove art about his project of

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:25,930
developing another operating system and

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:29,050
that started what we called and this

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,020
developed into the first phase of first

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,680
layer in the free software world which

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,709
were infected driven by this for freedom

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,750
the freedom to use the cost for any

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,970
purpose to read the code to modify it

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,040
and to redistribute it and that create

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,770
launched a bonanza of project of

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:53,380
open-source project that's that led to

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,450
what we call community open source free

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,070
software accessory free software based

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,990
on those values and those in those

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:07,360
freedoms and these freedoms in fact are

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:10,360
what made us here and what made all

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,940
these developers proud so this works

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,459
because it is technically efficient they

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,450
can share expertise they can access to

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:22,890
other people's knowledge and that's

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,839
still going on today and we still have a

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:30,310
number of those projects about one third

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:34,209
of the project r2w to depend on those

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,850
values on these this trajectory they can

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:39,640
be attached to this this kind of origin

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,579
but something happened in the 90s and

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,800
the turn of the century where free

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,550
software gave way to something called

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,100
open source

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,620
commercial open source so this is where

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,899
we were hitting the value we're

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,120
approaching to the value part of the

00:12:52,899 --> 00:13:03,010
journey this why because free software

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,980
the three freedoms enabled in fact a new

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,930
business model and what happened is that

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,329
all the product categories is sort of

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,959
the categories that were driven that

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:18,310
were controlled by proprietary vendors

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:20,560
became challenged by companies or new a

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,019
new generation of vendors that actually

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,620
were implementing an open-source

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,769
business model and that's what we call

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,390
the business oriented open-source it's

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,570
so much business oriented that big

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,579
companies had these giants whose name

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,800
you would never immediately associate

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:42,550
with open-source actually have invested

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,910
millions of dollars and other currencies

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,910
in in open source and in open source

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,730
projects so that's what we call that

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,410
that's the second layer I would say that

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,010
developed I would say at the beginning

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,600
of the century with we call it business

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,160
open source commercial open source open

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,140
source for the entrepreneurs and it

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,020
works because from the business

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,360
perspective it is efficient with reduced

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,200
marketing calls free community access to

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:16,029
free community expertise certain market

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,820
share etc now around 2010 something

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:21,990
happened because of the internet because

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,060
of the hyper connection because of

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,390
applications and networked application

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,370
distributor applications online services

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,500
the others big giant suddenly realized

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,180
that they they were running on open

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,770
source but the context are totally

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,149
changed we were not in the context of

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,370
enterprise computing we were in the

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,440
context of a global internet based

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,209
computing and everything being

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,410
interconnected these giants who were

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,839
running their businesses and their

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,290
technology platforms with open source

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,180
software had to extend this orbital

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,640
software add it to extend the technology

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,960
but by doing so what would they do this

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,090
by high

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,050
where they were developing no but they

00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:07,390
did they found that there was a virtue

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,360
in sharing this technology and they

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:14,550
opened up their technologies open

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,790
sourced it and created what we call now

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:24,400
an ecosystem based innovations and that

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:27,580
is this research research oriented open

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,490
source aimed at creating open source

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,760
Commons for the benefits of every one of

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,700
your community that's what we call maybe

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,870
open source by committees because it's

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:44,380
really driven by negotiations and some

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:50,170
some some sort of backstage power play

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:54,100
sometimes and it works because it is it

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,440
was strategically efficient the idea

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,350
here was really to be moving with

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,690
everyone along with the pack to have the

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,700
same information as the others to make

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,220
sure that you would not make the wrong

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,320
strategic decision the wrong investment

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,870
that would commit you for the next 10

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,500
years on the path that the the rest of

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:19,480
the industry would not be following so

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:24,850
this I mean the benefits of sharing the

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:28,330
code really was the evidence for most of

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,240
these investors of big companies and and

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,440
all of the followers and open source is

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,600
the vehicle for open innovation now so

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,360
we have here the three in the in our

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,580
journey the three layers are not saying

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,530
that one replaced the other they added

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,360
it to each other and the world of a

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,690
prince was today is a bit complex

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,170
because we have the first layer let's

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,470
say of community oriented project we

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:59,110
have this layer of enterprise oriented

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,810
project by companies developing an

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,390
openness model and we have this other

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,390
layer of innovation oriented open source

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,650
or research oriented open source by

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,839
companies working together to develop

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,419
when you

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,909
new technologies so that's the way we

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,069
see the journey and now just to finish a

00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:22,039
couple of questions because in that and

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:26,020
that background the idea was we see that

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:30,020
the values carried by the free software

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,400
have led to a huge value what's the

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,720
value of the Internet today because we

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,779
can probably connect Internet and open

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,860
source in a way what's the value of the

00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:46,820
Internet the economic value of the

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,649
Internet who captures the value it's a

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,830
question of perspective sometimes so I

00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:55,010
want to leave three three questions

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,350
three thoughtful thoughts of and that we

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:02,570
will have for the roundtable the first

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:05,840
one is that the value of software itself

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:08,809
is latent code is text you don't do

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,640
anything with code it's like having food

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,360
out there and you can that you cannot

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:18,049
open what's the value of food you can't

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,179
eat or think of a recipe you can you

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,669
read the recipe what's the value of this

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:27,010
recipe if you can actually have this

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:29,870
food in your plate so the value of

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:36,080
software the value of code is latent and

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:38,870
has to be made real by human activity by

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,270
somebody and this somebody are the

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,630
distributors the other package the

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:47,179
software does that implement it that

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,460
adapted that migrate the data into the

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,490
software set array so the implementation

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:56,059
of the software is what actually made

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,159
this the value of the software real it's

00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,380
pure DirectX you have the software and

00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,120
you have the implementation and the

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:07,100
result is something that is useful and

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:10,250
it and software is useful by leaving the

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,640
boundaries of the IT industry software

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,700
becomes useful when it helps clothes

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,990
designer or clothes manufacturer manage

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,929
sizes and colors and deliveries etc the

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,659
second that so software is we need to

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,000
make it

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,799
happen and it may it's made up and

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,779
software does not implement itself yet

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:37,350
so it's made real the values made real

00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:40,649
by by human activity the second thing is

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,880
that people Weaver you hear that

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,710
code-sharing are making everything

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,539
public with hamper innovation because

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,840
you will remove the motivations for

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,149
innovators to get their benefits in the

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,860
fruits of their innovation well when you

00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,769
look at what happens if you think of the

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,370
Internet as etc sharing the code sharing

00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:02,009
this software makes possible collective

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,000
innovation and by making possible this

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:08,730
collective innovation it drives progress

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,279
so code sharing is not hampering

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,980
innovation progress I would claim that

00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:20,460
code sharing on the country is a vehicle

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:25,139
for what speeds up innovation and the

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,629
last question or idea we could have that

00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:31,980
is connected with our a theme this this

00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:33,509
year is in fact you have two perspective

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,610
that may be in opposition

00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,870
the one from the engineers the

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,190
developers the researchers or the

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:45,539
academics that consider software as

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:47,009
shareable knowledge we all will we walk

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,110
on the shoulders of giants

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,940
we built next generation the next

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,289
version of the software on the world by

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,019
benefiting from the works all those

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,429
who've coded before us that's one

00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,620
perspective and then you have the

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,029
economic or business perspective the

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,590
perspective of business people the

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,809
marketers the salespeople the

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,230
shareholders who want to capture that

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:12,149
value and I think software has a

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:18,210
property a property that has to be owned

00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:20,269
and I think these two perspectives are

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,389
like putting together two magnets

00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:26,519
finding the balance point and I like to

00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:30,230
think that audibility 2 is precisely at

00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,639
this balance point between managing and

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,080
promoting the values of free software

00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:38,220
but also enabling the creation of value

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,990
thanks to three software

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,559
thank you

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,559
