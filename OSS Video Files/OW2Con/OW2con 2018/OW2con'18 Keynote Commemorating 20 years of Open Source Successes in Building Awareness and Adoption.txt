[Music]

00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:13,980
well good morning my apologies for being

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,770
deep-voiced today I'm carrying a disease

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,250
on behalf of society that I picked up

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,100
and playing someone so I spoke to you

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,420
last year and I checked my slides and I

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,429
these are all different that the two

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,890
talks go very well together so if you go

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,450
look at last year's slides last year's

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,079
talk was all about what's gonna happen

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,050
next in open source and I still stand by

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,059
those predictions this year's talk is

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,760
looking back at the lessons that we've

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,489
learned from the first 20 years of open

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,739
source so I'm president of the open

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,670
source initiative the open source

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:59,160
initiative was formed 20 years ago so

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:02,129
it's our 20th birthday and we are an

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,090
international charity that was

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,150
established to promote the idea of open

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,220
source and to unite the open source

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,080
community of communities and so in the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,590
last few years we have been gathering

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,979
together that community of communities

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:27,720
which as you'll see includes ow2 into a

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:34,049
community of affiliates who all support

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,490
and promote open source and it's good to

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,860
look back at why all those organizations

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,470
exist now before there was open source

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,240
there was free software in actual fact

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,119
there were two things going on at the

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,350
same time you've got two gentlemen here

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:56,729
on the screen on your left is bill joy

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,799
bill joy from 1977 onwards was a

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:04,159
graduate student at the University of

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:09,330
Berkeley and he worked with Ken Thompson

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,989
on Pascal and he created a sequence of

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,770
distributions of UNIX that made a TN

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,950
t--'s Unix

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,910
system useful and overtime AT&T UNIX

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,910
turned into a what was it was eliminated

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,480
from the BSD distribution and there was

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,420
famously in 1991 a lawsuit by AT&T who

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,340
couldn't believe that anyone had

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:36,360
rewritten all their stuff and created an

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:40,950
independent operating system and BSD

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:45,000
UNIX first became licensed in a way that

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:48,510
anybody could use it in 1989 and that

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,580
was the same year that Richard

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,520
Stallman's project to create the GU new

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,510
project also first was released under

00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,420
the GPL license we often forget that the

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,900
BSD licensed under GPL happened in the

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,720
same year they were both an expression

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,770
of the desire of the software industry

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:15,750
to be set free from restrictions on

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:19,620
innovation we've been sold the line that

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,650
innovation only happens in private but

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,950
we all knew from 1977 onwards that

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,010
innovation most often happens in public

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,709
and in community now back in those days

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,090
in public in in community was very

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,240
difficult to work with

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,030
so one BSD which was builders first

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,950
distribution was only sent out to about

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,860
11 people on magnetic tape and 2 BSD was

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,420
sent out I think to about 50 people but

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,670
that was still a community of

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:55,080
distribution and when the internet came

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:59,130
along this pre-existing idea began to

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,700
become more popular mmm there we go now

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,010
underlying Richard Stallman's idea was

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,250
the idea that we should each

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,220
individually have Liberty's software

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,270
freedom defines a personal ethical

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:21,530
system it defines the idea that the user

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:26,940
of software should be free to use study

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:28,080
improve and share software and that's a

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,810
great system

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,430
of personal values but we discovered

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:38,729
around about 1998 that starting from the

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,569
position of personal ethical values was

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:46,199
a poor place to persuade businesses to

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:49,889
support those ethical values and so in

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:53,129
1998 the open source campaign was

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,439
created by a group of people and this

00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,090
quote is from the founder of the open

00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,310
source initiative bruce perens

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,789
who also wrote the Debian free software

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,969
guidelines and he explains that open

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:09,270
source is the proper name of a campaign

00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:12,599
to promote the pre-existing concept of

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,680
free software to business and to certify

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:18,509
licenses to a rule set so if you hear

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,639
people telling you that open source and

00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:23,669
free software are enemies that is

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,729
complete rubbish open source is a

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:31,620
marketing campaign for free software if

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:34,560
ever you wonder how open source applies

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,479
to a particular concept the way you

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
answer that question is not by asking

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,729
your lawyer but by getting out your

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,690
moral compass and asking what would

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,060
Richard Stallman do open source lets

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,909
software users and developers advanced

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,270
software freedom at work as well as in

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:56,449
private and that is what has created the

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,300
software revolution of the last 20 years

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:03,659
we have unleashed the values of software

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,599
freedom under the marketing name of open

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:12,000
source and that has allowed people to

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:14,250
adopt the posture of Liberty just as

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
those dock cranes you see there in New

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,509
Jersey are adopting the posture of

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,089
Liberty so it has allowed businesses

00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,029
everywhere without realizing it to adopt

00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:27,349
the posture of Liberty and create more

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:31,500
freedom for more people in more places

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,539
so how things gone well the first decade

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,539
there's three characteristics for you

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:39,089
there I would say the first decade of

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,760
open source was characterized by upstart

00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:44,550
advocacy by open source

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,160
licensing becoming very popular and by

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,290
endless talk of open source business

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,030
models here's a quick timeline for you

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,220
the the term open source was first

00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,090
coined in connection with software

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,310
freedom in 1998 there is some dispute

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,110
about that because there are people who

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,040
who claimed they were already using the

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,020
term as early as 1995 but it there is no

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,450
doubt that the group of people who fat

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,920
who came on to found the open source

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,560
initiative met in Silicon Valley in 1998

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,270
and had the term proposed to them by

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,860
Christine Peterson who had never heard

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,840
the term before she thought she had made

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,030
it up and so let's say 1998 let's say

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,120
the beginning of February 1998 as the

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,300
start of open source the open source

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,440
definition was published in 1999

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,430
Microsoft called Linux a cancer in 2001

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,720
we discovered that they were plotting

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,430
against us in 2004 son realized that it

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,140
was going to die if it didn't do open

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:56,130
source in 2005 and by 2008 10 years on

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:59,600
most CEOs understood open source as a

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,400
benefit rather than as a disadvantage

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,210
now what made open source licensing

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,680
succeed in those 10 years I'd like to

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,640
suggest to you it was the

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,970
crystallization of consensus it was the

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,390
use of multilateral agreement and it was

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,470
creating safe spaces for innovation open

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:25,110
source licenses are not your lawyers

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,700
copyright licenses normally when you do

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,760
a business copyright license

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,270
it is a truce it is a treaty between

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,490
parties that potentially hate each other

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,880
to not fight in these areas of mutual

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,460
advantage but an open-source license is

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,280
not a bilateral license it is a

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,990
multilateral license it is the

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,880
permissions and norms of a community and

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,860
in order to become the permissions and

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
norms of a community the community has

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,820
to discuss the license

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,650
and at the end of the discussion

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:06,620
somebody somebody has to memorialize the

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:09,210
discussion and so what OSI does is OSI

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,590
hosts the discussion about open source

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,290
licenses summarises the discussion and

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:20,310
where the community agrees that a given

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:23,520
license delivers software freedom then

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,800
we state that a license is an open

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,920
source license and that's that's the

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,320
process that we follow somebody once

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:36,120
said they didn't want to have oh s I as

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:39,360
the king of their open source and I deny

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,530
that OSI is the king of anything OSI is

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,890
not the king

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,620
OSI is the Speaker of the House we

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,650
preside over the debate we gain our

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,770
authority because our affiliate

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,530
organizations recognize that that is

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,590
what OSI does we have more than 50

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:02,460
affiliate organizations Debian Wikimedia

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:04,440
owt to all sorts of other organizations

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,190
that recognize that this is what OSI

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,160
does and what we do is we remember what

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,630
everyone agreed and then we remind

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
people who want to do something

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:20,220
different that that's not what everyone

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:22,770
agreed and that creates safe spaces for

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,410
software development an open-source

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,620
project is a safe space for

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,870
collaboration it's a place where control

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,840
points have been mitigated where

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,670
business models are isolated and where

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,000
code is made available for unknown

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,080
others what I mean by those things

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,540
there's an acronym there I'll leave you

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:49,080
to find it up control points Society

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,510
decided a long time ago that innovation

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,470
would perish if there were not

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,350
incentives for it to be made public and

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,110
so we decided that we would create

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:04,620
temporary internet m / Airy intellectual

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,600
monopolies to encourage innovators to

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,250
make their innovation public we call

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,050
those things copyright

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:16,140
and patents and trademarks unfortunately

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,480
those things have been subverted instead

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,760
of being the origin of future Liberty

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,670
and knowledge they have been turned into

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:28,130
ways of locking people out of knowledge

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,960
and so software freedom and open-source

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,660
mitigate those ownerships of control

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,960
points by letting people spend their

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,730
intellectual monopolies on collaboration

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:44,460
and so that is what lies behind what OSI

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:48,270
approves as an approved license we

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:51,570
approve licenses that give people all

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:54,870
the freedoms that they need to create

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,650
software it's not about following some

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,820
set of rules

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:02,970
I do get lawyers who come to OSI trying

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,550
to game our system they come along with

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,950
a brilliant open-source license that

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,550
will give their business special

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:14,700
advantage and they somehow make it meet

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,700
all the terms of all ten of the clauses

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,270
of the open source definition but OSI

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,800
still does not approve their license

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,010
because it doesn't deliver software

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,320
freedom because that's what matters

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,330
because after all open source is the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,070
same thing as free software so we

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,420
couldn't possibly approve a license that

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:38,430
didn't make free software could we

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,580
secondly business models now I have to

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:45,060
tell you open source doesn't have any

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:49,470
business models businesses have business

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:52,800
models open source grants people

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,810
permission to collaborate so your

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,010
business model is your responsibility

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,770
alone and the norms of open source

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,800
projects actually creates safety from

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,410
your business models they isolate your

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,560
business model from his business model

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,050
and from her business model so that we

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,290
can all conduct our business and yet

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,970
still collaborate in a community and if

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,209
you're trying to create an open source

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,050
project that embodies a business model

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,200
then you're probably

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,250
to do something that isn't open-source

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,339
because open source doesn't have

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,769
business models and that's the reason

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,140
why oh s I will not approve your

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,570
application for a license that specially

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,029
advantages your business model because

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,209
the whole point of open source is to

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,920
create a safe space where your business

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:50,130
model can't influence my business model

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,190
so the first decade open source one in

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,690
the first decade because Rios beats re

00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,120
implementation but if I used to work on

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,010
reuse at IBM in the early 90s and I

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,100
discovered that actually no one no

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,899
software developer wants to reuse code

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,730
all software developers want to write

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,810
the code again given the ability to do

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:16,769
so and as it turns out collaborative

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,930
development beats reuse but reuse and

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,360
collaborative development are killed by

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,160
permission seeking so software freedom

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,360
grants all the rights you need in

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,640
advance and OSI approval of a license

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,459
proves that the rights have been granted

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,000
in advance and so as a consequence

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,079
software developers feel free to climb

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,560
up on the shoulders of the Giants

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:44,100
buildin and innovate based on other

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,430
people's work now then that came the

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,940
second decade here's a quick timeline

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:54,540
for you in 2008 most open-source was

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,279
invisible I worked at Sun at the time we

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,170
used to go to businesses and ask them

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,240
what their open-source strategy was and

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,149
they would tell us there was no open

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,329
source in their business and then we

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,140
would ask them well what's running your

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,290
website

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,459
oh well that's Apache and what's running

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,579
your commerce all that's running on

00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,589
Tomcat and we would discover that

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,410
actually their whole infrastructure was

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,970
running open-source it's just that they

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,709
had never realized it because their

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:27,180
developers hadn't really told them that

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:31,230
that was what was going on so in those

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,810
10 years we saw web service spring up

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,250
people tried to prevent web services

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,860
happening by

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,160
rerun

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,200
kolba again but developers has managed

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,810
to implement rest thanks to Roy fielding

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,329
and the rest as they say is history and

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,890
by 2015 it turned out the Microsoft

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,050
didn't think Linux was a cancer after

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:55,540
all they said it was something they

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:57,970
loved by 2018 we're finding that open

00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,470
source is at the heart of all new

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,570
companies and software

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,700
there could be no Twitter without open

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,100
source there could be no Facebook

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,779
without open source there is no future

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,390
for your company without open source

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,910
because open source is the only way you

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,360
can come to market fast enough in an age

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,920
of complexity if you don't use open

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,829
source you have to reinvent the

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,950
complexity and you can't do that fast

00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,390
enough so let's talk about a couple of

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,269
things let's talk about license

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:31,779
enforcement I still hear people telling

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:35,290
me how dangerous the GPL is to their

00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:39,190
businesses and I am here to tell you no

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:41,579
you're wrong the GPL is just fine the

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,070
GPL creates a collaborative environment

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:47,410
environment around code where as long as

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,440
everybody in the community is subject to

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,890
its terms on the same basis everybody

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,930
remains protected from each other and

00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:02,320
you can't use my innovation to put me

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:03,959
out of business however you do have to

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,500
comply with the terms of the license

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,049
remember that if you're using

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,120
open-source code you've only got a

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,459
copyright license if you comply with the

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,069
conditions of the code though it's got

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,919
the conditions of the license the media

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,329
industry has given us a nice term to use

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,549
for people who don't engage in

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:27,220
compliance activities they are called

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:29,679
pirates and compliance is not some

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,710
esoteric thing it's about not being a

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,230
software pirate software piracy was a

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,450
term that Microsoft invented to promote

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,820
their business model about 15 years ago

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,820
but it turns out it's still useful if

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,740
you're using GPL software and you are

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,220
not making the full corresponding source

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,590
available then you are a pirate now I'd

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,960
like to warn you

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,320
that most open-source communities don't

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,330
like pirates and that the easiest way to

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,600
not be a pirate is to be in compliance

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,520
with the terms of the license and you'll

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,309
find that open-source communities will

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,799
help you with that because open-source

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,520
licenses are multilateral they are the

00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,480
consensus of the community they are the

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,450
Constitution of all the developers

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,770
gathered together everyone wants to help

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,899
you get into compliance so you you

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,960
shouldn't receive a cease and desist

00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:26,820
letter for a GPL violation you should

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,659
instead receive and offer to help you

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,970
come into compliance and that's what

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:35,399
will happen as long as you don't decide

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,710
that you're going to make things

00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:40,500
difficult now the other thing I was

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,710
going to explain to you was that license

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,220
compliance is not just for the GPL if

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,299
you look back at the BSD license and the

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,690
MIT license they require you to publish

00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,909
a notice identifying the authors of the

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,679
code that you are using and you are

00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,890
required to publish that notice with the

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,799
binary if you make it publicly available

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:08,610
in your manual or on the screen when the

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,620
software comes up and if you don't

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,299
comply with that condition then you

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,049
don't have a copyright license and you

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:19,020
are a pirate and I would like to alert

00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:22,649
you to your responsibility to comply

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,510
with the terms of the BSD license it is

00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,789
your responsibility to comply with it

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,399
and one day somebody is going to come

00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:32,760
looking for you if you don't comply with

00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:34,980
the terms of the BSD license I'd like to

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,750
suggest to you that it is much easier to

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,899
comply with the terms of the beer of the

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,630
GPL than it is to comply with the terms

00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:44,549
of the BSD license and I'd like to

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,409
suggest you that the risks involved

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,500
because there are so many unnamed

00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:51,360
authors in BSD code the risks involved

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,539
of non-compliance are far greater than

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,789
those of the GPL you think the GPL is a

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:59,640
problem because Harold welter and other

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,760
people have been doing enforcement but

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,570
you ain't seen nothing yet when the BSD

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,460
and MIT and

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,790
has come along you've got a real problem

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,010
so I suggest you get with the program

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,740
and start acknowledging who the authors

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,930
are of all that BSD and MIT code out

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:24,060
there or of course you could migrate to

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:27,030
the GPL to avoid the problem okay and

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,290
then patents are a problem now patents

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,360
are a problem because they create

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,430
uncertainty and they create a need to go

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,500
ask for permission and software

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,570
developers don't like uncertainty and

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,430
software developers don't like asking

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,460
for permission before they innovate and

00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,290
if software developers suspect there are

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,960
patents involved anywhere they will go

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,480
somewhere else unless you compel them to

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,600
do so to use the software usually by

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,950
paying them now a long time ago in 2005

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,690
OSI ran a process called the open

00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,370
standards requirement and we did that

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,900
because we discovered there were a lot

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,700
of people who thought that open

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,480
standards always came with patents

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,360
associated with them and we agreed what

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,460
the rules were if an open source project

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,190
was going to comply with the open source

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,130
definition in the area of standards and

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,860
patents now it turns out that although

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,140
the rules had changed and everybody was

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,570
now rowing boats instead of lighting

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,050
fires there were some people who hadn't

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,270
got the memo and we have discovered that

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:34,470
there's a bunch of people who think that

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:38,340
standards essential patents are in all

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:41,430
standards and we have discovered that

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,710
there are people who want to redefine

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:50,280
open source as excluding patent rights

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,220
now this is a long topic but I'm here to

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,760
tell you that open source licenses all

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,790
grant you all the rights necessary to

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,770
collaborate with others freely and that

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,380
word all is a big word it may be only

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,780
three letters but it means it includes

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,930
all intellectual property category is

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,140
necessary for collaboration so if there

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:16,260
are patents then open-source license is

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,520
licensed them now this is the reason why

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,510
RSA doesn't

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,750
like attempts to approve open-source

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,430
licenses that deny patent rights because

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,020
we think those licenses don't give all

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,200
the rights necessary for collaboration

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,900
and that's the reason why RSI is now

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,760
engaging with standards organizations to

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,890
help the the the the the late comers on

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,200
the bell-curve

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,870
realize that you can't have open source

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,460
and still monetize patterns if you're

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,440
interested in this topic you should come

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,240
and talk to me later because there's

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,610
lots going on so here we go it's been 20

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,250
years congratulations on being here on

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:04,580
the 20th birthday it's been 35 years

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:08,880
since free software and BSD were

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:12,090
formalized and in all that time we have

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,210
seen that open-source is a pragmatic

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,920
approach to guaranteeing that the

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,550
ethical construct of software freedom

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,890
gets granted to everybody the future of

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,530
open-source is the future of software

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,800
and the future of software is software

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:31,380
freedom it's very important that we

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,280
remain united it's very important that

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,570
we keep our hand on our moral compass

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,970
because when you get asked a question

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:44,160
about whether open-source and IOT are

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,500
compatible or where the open source and

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,390
the cloud are compatible or whether

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,730
open-source software needs to be public

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,070
the correct answer is not to ask your

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:57,150
lawyer it is to check your moral compass

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:59,400
and I encourage you to do that I

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,010
encourage you to join our Sai of course

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,740
because we need more members I actually

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,230
encourage you to join many organizations

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,500
I encourage you you're all members of

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,540
owt too you might be a member of

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,170
something like the Linux Foundation or

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,350
OpenStack but I encourage you to support

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,560
OSI FSF fsfe and software freedom

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:25,470
Conservancy we are all public charities

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,880
so we don't do what you say we do things

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,300
that are in for the benefit of the

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,659
public but without us guaranteeing the

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,879
moral

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,739
compass for the future things are going

00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:39,659
to get lost so please remember to

00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:41,340
support and promote our si FSF fsfe

00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:44,669
software freedom Conservancy and other

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,259
public charities and with that I thank

00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:49,180
you very much for your attention and I

00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:53,910
hand the tiller back to Oh W to

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,910
