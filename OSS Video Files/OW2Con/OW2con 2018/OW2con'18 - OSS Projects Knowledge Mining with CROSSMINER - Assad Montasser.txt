[Music]

00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:22,310
[Applause]

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:22,310
thank you any questions w2

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:37,230
infrastructure so yes is available and

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,300
you can use as a starting point to

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:49,320
implemented a continuous delivery in

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:49,620
your project okay thank you okay thank

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,570
you

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:59,430
Nicola okay so we we have one more

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,170
presentation aside montasser who is

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,140
going to talk about knowledge mine in

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,760
using cross miner and I'm not going to

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,680
say anything else because I'm going to

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,700
discover with you guys what's that what

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,700
that is all about

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,659
hello good morning my name is Assad I am

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,009
working at other videos who as a

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,619
software engineer and I'm working on

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:32,460
mainly on two european project one is

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,040
stamp and danyele introduced you just

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,500
after lunch and the other one is cross

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,200
miner those two projects are in the

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:46,530
origin 2020 but just sorry just before

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,189
starting the presentation I just want to

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,970
go back a little in time and just 20

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,850
years ago and we had this the problem

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,969
the program what was an issue is to to

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,729
find information this was very hard and

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,130
Google existed but for example when you

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,409
were a developer what you were doing you

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,130
were looking for information in books in

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:15,970
books sorry in books

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,700
and now today what we have the main

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,840
issue is that if you do for example an

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,780
example you do

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,210
Jason pass in Google you will find like

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,310
hundreds of pages or maybe more thousand

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,610
I don't know but huge huge information

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,760
so now the challenge is to find the

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:37,210
appropriate a good information and this

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,280
is the real challenge I mean what is the

00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:45,160
basic idea underlying cross miner

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,520
project so cross miner three points

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,800
really important so the first one is

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,950
mining information we have lots of

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,630
information on there available so we

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,450
have to get this information but this

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,390
information alone is not enough so what

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,730
we need with this information is to to

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,640
manage it in an intelligent way so to

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,330
build this knowledge base so this is the

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,580
second task and the third one is because

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,050
with this knowledge what we can do so

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,700
it's good to have this knowledge but

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,730
what we can do with this knowledge so

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,370
this will be to provide recommendations

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,430
so these recommendations could be for

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,990
developers when for the project managers

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,630
but this information also could be for

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:35,670
person who are taking decisions for

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:40,780
quality so I will give you more examples

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:44,530
through the other body to use case so I

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,470
told you cross miner is a European

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,530
research project what I didn't told you

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,850
I tell you is that cross miner is the

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,920
continuation of another European project

00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,010
which was called OSS metal open through

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,720
software metal and this is almost the

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:07,510
same team the working on cross miner and

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,390
this project involves researching from

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,990
all over Europe so we have configuration

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,540
management natural language processing

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:18,880
code analysis integration with forges

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,530
and software dashboard we will go

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,770
through this point during the

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:27,009
presentation so and

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,650
Eclipse Eclipse is one of the partner in

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:33,099
the cross miner project and Eclipse will

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,099
provide an ID a for all these tools that

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:39,430
we're going to see so just a brief

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:43,300
reminder on OSS matter because this was

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,030
the foundation so OSS matter was more to

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,870
deal with this extracting this mining

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,690
information so it was a three years

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,259
project European project so they built a

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,539
bunch of tools I don't know exactly how

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,520
many the precise number but there are

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:03,849
many many tools to extract information

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:09,909
from github repositories from mail

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:14,740
archives from JIRA issues or to I mean

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:17,919
lots of different sources so this is was

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,970
the base OSS meter and the same team on

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,330
this foundation cross miner comes next

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,300
so cross miner what we are doing in

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,699
what's the aim of cross miner is for

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,180
example you have the source code mining

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,210
you have code on github and so we will

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,560
just extract this information to provide

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,840
to developers so this could be a text

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,039
mining for example you have on forums

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,729
like you have a forum and you have

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,000
discussions so what in the NLP teamed

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:57,340
what we are doing is there are

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,250
processing this text to find information

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,400
that could help developers configuration

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,770
mining is another branch we have a

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,750
different project and some projects

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,990
share the same could share the same

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,530
project configuration where we are

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,300
looking for so this will the extract

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,030
information and this will give

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,310
recommendations to project so all this

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,370
knowledge extraction this is the the

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:31,509
basic the first step of the cross mining

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:35,229
project so what we see below was this

00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,210
bridge mainly first by the OSS matter

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,340
and

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:44,190
working on cross miner and this schema

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,810
shows you the three layers I talked

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:50,580
first so extracting information

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,940
processing this information in order to

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,710
have the knowledge and representing

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,100
recommendations because knowledge

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:02,340
without front pure knowledge is useless

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,009
for for developer for the community I

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,530
mean it's good for AI but it's for us

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:10,620
humans we have to present

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:16,759
recommendations that can be that are

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:20,310
accessible to human beings so this is a

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,539
sample of the tools contained in the

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,150
cross minor project

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,009
so the first these tools are not all

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,330
there are in this stage of development

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:32,479
so there are some some things but you

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,610
can access them through the github

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,310
repositories on cross miner I gave them

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:43,440
in this presentation this presentation

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:46,320
will be downloadable on uh w2 website so

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,289
if you want to sewer URLs you can access

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,430
them but these tools are not fully

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:57,270
functional just to just to say so cross

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,960
seam is one tool about the similar OSS

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:04,229
project so the base is for example you

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,990
are let's take the first example the

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,960
JSON parsing so you're looking for you

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,419
want to do JSON parsing so what you will

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,360
do is you this tool will help you to

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,849
find similar OSS project and it will

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,400
present you so you can say okay this one

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:25,380
yeah it looks nice so I can take some of

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,159
it and so you have you you it takes it

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:32,370
increase your speed for development

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:37,349
cross rec is another tool cross rec is

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:40,680
more for the library the configuration

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,520
part the recommendations so for example

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,740
before the let's take our JSON parsing

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,800
still examples or the JSON parsing so

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,320
what kind of libraries Yulin so this is

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,930
police pretty obvious so you won't need

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,010
many libraries but for more complex

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,230
projects you it will help you to have

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,350
some recommendations because people have

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,720
worked on different tools and so to me

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,510
it's one important thing also in OSS

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,850
community our open source community is

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:17,160
to reuse and not to start from scratch

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:21,120
so and scarce cava is the Eclipse

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:25,350
plug-in project ever based IDE as cover

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,820
it's still on the work so I heard the

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:33,180
first today on the riverboat will be

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,970
available in September 2008 at least

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,310
this is what is written in the page so I

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,740
will have more information on these

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,829
tools next week because there is a

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,480
plenary meeting so but so far this is

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:52,560
the information I have so let's talk

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,260
about some use cases so these are the

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,770
list of some use cases and I will more

00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,410
talk about our use cases at uh W to we

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,670
are partner in this project and we have

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:08,820
a use case so this is just some examples

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,910
of the other use cases in this project

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,750
so for example there are debates the IOT

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,690
devices so there is the multi sector IT

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:22,230
software services the api's coupled

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:27,720
evolution software analytics this I will

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:30,180
talk more just just in a minute so an

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,190
eclipse project except for support for

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,250
projects also these are the use cases

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:39,540
but what I would say interests me more

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,779
as are the wheel to software engineer is

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,500
our use case so this is the one I'm

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,079
gonna introduce to you so our use case

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,260
as part of our use case so what we did

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,540
right now is the presentation so I was

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,970
talking about the extraction the

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,360
knowledge and then the presentation the

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,200
recommendation so one of the tool we are

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,830
we

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,130
used and we are using right now at w2 is

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,630
developed by Peter Chia and this is

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:17,010
called grimmer lab and grimoire lab uses

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:20,820
elasticsearch I wants it for the it's

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,460
not a database but for the source and it

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,600
uses Cabana Cabana is coupled with

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,450
elasticsearch to present this data

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,580
stored in elasticsearch and so Rimmer

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,100
lab proposes different tools it's

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,650
written in Python and it proposes

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,830
different tools to access to mine

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:47,220
information from github repositories

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:50,520
from male main man from JIRA from github

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,810
also issues but we don't use github

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,990
issues we use git lab at uh w-2 so this

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,420
is something that is coming it's we are

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,360
working on it on it at a w-2 to

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:08,250
integrate so we're working together with

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,140
the with HR team on grimmer lab and with

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,170
these tools in Python to extract

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,550
information and you produced dashboard

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:19,440
web dashboard which are very very you

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,320
will see just in a moment I will show

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,320
you so you have lots of information for

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,490
you so this is the first stage right now

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,090
they are working on another tool so the

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,890
presentation on the last previous

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,650
meeting so I'm really looking forward

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,600
next week to see the advancement on this

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,030
one so this will be because for now the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,660
dashboard are still you have a model you

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,170
cannot unless you know how to work with

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,900
Cabana

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,020
to personalize them so they are working

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:55,140
on a tool that you can just with the

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,890
human language by configuration you can

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,750
obtain personalize your your own

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:07,020
dashboard so just before showing you the

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:09,390
dashboards I wanted to say that this use

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,730
case is the first step of our use case

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,550
because we plan also to include eight

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,240
integrate the other tools cross red

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,420
cross see

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,740
so I hope the next presentation I can

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:29,190
show you also examples of this tools at

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:33,270
uh w2 so this is I have to some screens

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:36,899
from this dashboard and I don't know how

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:45,779
can you show but I don't know if you see

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:49,440
well or not but just the first the first

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:52,740
that is the commit I choose the stamp

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,589
project so because we are doing this for

00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:00,110
stamp and so we have the only commit in

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:02,940
the repository but every project

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,580
including every project we have the

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,190
number of authors 34 and the number of

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,500
repositories are the minister and then

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:14,520
we have for example this evolution

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,250
commit on time but also by authors we

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,300
have the top project so the top project

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,430
it shows you the project that where

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,399
there are the most comets so what we can

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,070
see right now is at this moment at the

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,200
moment we did this dashboard stamp

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,640
project this part this protects mark

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:40,110
where there are comets so you have also

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:43,050
this this circle I am sorry my English I

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,990
know how to say it in French but but

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:49,620
this is a pie chart thank you

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:53,010
the spy chart that shows you it's my

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,200
domain so for example I don't see very

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,770
well but we can see for example news

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,110
forum yeah you know yeah that's fr I

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,700
think they are the most in the purple

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,959
color so just from from experience and

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,690
so we can see these are visual

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:16,230
information information so right now you

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,560
have the same information but on in the

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:22,430
table and you have the repositories also

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,270
in the table and you have the domains as

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,560
during the time so but what is maybe

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:33,630
more important

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:37,050
or about this is this right now is just

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:40,200
the pattern the the motor is fixed so

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:42,960
the goal for the next for the future is

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,770
you personalize you customize your own

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,950
dashboard without having to learn how to

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:54,650
work with cabaña so and there's another

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:56,670
point also this is information at one

00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:01,050
time tea time

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,570
so the goal also in in the future is to

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,330
integrate they are working on tools to

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:10,500
configure and just to - in order to

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,830
integrate them in the CI pipeline so in

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,470
order for example let's say maybe not

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,750
every commit but every week just or

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,529
every day depending on the project to

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:29,460
refresh the data under this because the

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:31,970
data it's under elasticsearch so it's so

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,970
that's it

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,020
