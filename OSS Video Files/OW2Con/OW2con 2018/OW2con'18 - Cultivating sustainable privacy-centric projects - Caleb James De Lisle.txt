Title: OW2con'18 - Cultivating sustainable privacy-centric projects - Caleb James De Lisle
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Large cloud providers that have made their fortunes by leveraging users' personal data are facing a paradigm shift with the arrival of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While small enterprises are equally liable for protecting user data, they are well positioned to develop privacy-enhancing technologies since they are not competitive in the big-data market anyway.

There is much excitement in the crypto space, finally extending beyond the established community, but there are still many challenges to establish your enterprise as a trustworthy service provider. This presentation will explore the difficulties of cultivating a community around open-source projects, developing technologies which are difficult to coopt into proprietary platforms, and innovating in a culture where mistakes can have severe consequences. I'll share insights based on the experiences of the CryptPad development team, and how we have made crypto work for us.

	00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:12,660
little folks talk about privacy centric

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,690
projects and now the last few few

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,760
lectures were about security and I mean

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,880
that the the concepts are all basically

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,619
the same thing it we have containers too

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,920
it's just that our container is in fact

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,970
the web browser but it's also about

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,809
sustainability trying to make a project

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:36,390
sustainable and able to survive in the

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,000
long term so sustainability

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,489
well basically sustainability is what

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,219
you get when you have every user of this

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,559
of the the project be a contributor of

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,629
some sort and for proprietary that's

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,210
easy ish because everybody just

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,820
contributes some money open-source you

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,800
contribute skills and cloud free cloud

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,570
freemium it's you're contributing

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,149
personal data and you're contributing to

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:06,170
being part of that community now so what

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:10,439
we have and and this this crypt pad is

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,030
it was what I'm presenting this on so

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,070
the old standard was that we had the

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,040
desktop all your data was private by

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,689
default because sat on the desktop there

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,280
was a problem of piracy but users and

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,830
users without money were unable to

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,650
participate and unable to contribute

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,860
using their their skills open source

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,630
came along and it be it allows people to

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:41,670
to contribute to the sustainability by

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:45,630
way of their technical know-how however

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,149
that leaves users without so much

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,920
know-how is often not so able to

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,700
participate and then we end up seeing

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,500
lots of middleware and programming tools

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,040
do really well in the open source and

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,090
then like software for the end-user it's

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,399
not so easy cloud is another thing it's

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,819
kind of a mix of proprietary and hosted

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,709
freeware they kind of they solved the

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,530
piracy problem because they don't

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,080
actually give you the software use

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,450
contribute personal data and they also

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,150
contribute to building an ecosystem and

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,040
that ecosystem is what gives the cloud

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,020
providers some staying power against the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,340
next one coming along and disrupting

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,430
them and importantly cloud is is kind of

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,110
in some way democratic because it

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,030
accommodates users that don't have

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,819
either technical know-how or money to

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,209
contribute because they contribute sort

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,420
of with their feet however then came the

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:49,110
gdpr and this has been a really

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,750
interesting thing that happened recently

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,910
it it clarified the question of who owns

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,250
the personal data it's the person that's

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,750
that's done so and my personal feeling

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,640
is that so you have the right to be

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,890
deleted the right to all these things I

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,920
find I think that in the long term we're

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,260
gonna find that the requirement that

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,569
services must allow export of personal

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,450
data is going to be really one of the

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:19,110
best in most important aspects of the

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,480
GDP art because it allows these these

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,630
these companies to be disrupted because

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,100
another one can can set up or an open

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,950
source project can set up and say oh

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,570
yeah we take Twitter imports just export

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,130
your Twitter and you can import it here

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,930
and you can you can be you can just move

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,799
here so people can vote with their feet

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,489
a lot easier than they could in the past

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:44,070
so pad what is crypt bad well I'm

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,810
I'm presenting on crypt pad it's kind of

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,280
like a Google Docs except the server

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,140
doesn't know what you're typing and

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,269
that's really important because it's

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,019
like the desktop model that we used to

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:58,470
have but it's also like it's also it's a

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,450
cloud service but the server only sees

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,950
encrypted data and it's all encrypted in

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,690
the web browser that's running on this

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,940
this laptop so that's similar in design

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,260
to like signal or Y or whatsapp or

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,959
matrix these the this encrypting things

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,180
and then sending them and to end it's

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,430
it's pretty well understood for

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,530
messengers but what pad takes it a

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,140
step further and uses it for things that

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,510
are not just sending messages you can

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,940
collaborate on a document together

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,830
so what we have there features we have a

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,540
rich text editor which hopefully I'll be

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,210
able to show you in a minute

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,130
markdown code editor presentation editor

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,800
which you're looking at the Kanban board

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,600
white board what's important is that all

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,090
this stuff is using the same underlying

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,230
API you basically you develop a crypt

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,600
app and it's it's running on encryption

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:54,390
right from the start so you don't need

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,420
to develop the encryption each time the

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,820
security model the security model is

00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,520
that basically the server has no power

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,030
over you unless it is able to make you

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,510
run code that's not the code that it

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,920
should be so that's kind of a problem

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,780
because the server does give you the

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,550
code and so you have to trust the server

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,550
to give you the right code but once you

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,060
get that code then the server can't peek

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,060
at what you're doing

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,630
sustainability model well we're kind of

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,270
working on that but what we're looking

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,880
at doing is some open source some cloud

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,120
we're hoping that people will pay for

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,850
features pay for additional storage we

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,430
give away the source code we can have

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,080
paying apps which the crib pad just by

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,600
default doesn't load them unless you've

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,660
paid for them and obviously being open

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,760
source people can just break that but we

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,580
have this idea of making an authenticity

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,730
signature which says this is the code

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,400
that is not going to own your data but

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,190
it also has some rules that for example

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,710
you can't use extended features without

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,660
paying for them so we're trying to go

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,000
the direction of yes it's open source

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,290
yes there are things you have to pay for

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,020
still next steps well we're looking at

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:17,370
editing of office documents and stronger

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,490
permissions model Federation is possibly

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,280
on the mail but I want to show you

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,350
something that nobody's nobody's seen

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,510
this yet it's been developed basically

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,040
today and yesterday and this morning and

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,850
five minutes ago

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,430
it's client-side securing of client-side

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,390
code so I told you that the server gives

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,300
you the code and if if any bad code is

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,009
running in the website context as

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,379
you probably know that's just a total

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,940
compromise there's nothing left and the

00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,349
server can't this server you have to

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,370
trust it it can send you basically

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:54,830
anything so there's a there's a solution

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,659
that a the html5 people gave us which is

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,180
called sub resource integrity and so

00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:02,539
this is how you include a script into

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,159
your website but that script it will you

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,289
this the browser will ask the server

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:09,430
what is that thing and the server can

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:12,740
send whatever it wants if you do this

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,900
then the browser will ask the server for

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,969
the thing the server will give it the

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,520
thing and then it will do a hash check

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:22,069
on that and if the thing is not exactly

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,099
the thing that passes to that big random

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,289
number then the the browser will not

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:31,340
load it so the server can only send you

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:36,110
one thing but how do we get the hash

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:39,319
well you can have a manifest of all the

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,919
hashes of everything that everything in

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,310
the crib pad then you can have a signed

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,680
hash of the manifest and then you can

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,659
have a bootloader which checks the

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,229
signature and the bootloader can be

00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:56,449
included in the HTML file and which is

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,539
and the bootloader and the HTML file are

00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:02,599
never updated it sounds pretty

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,520
complicated it's a bit complicated the

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,529
idea is that you have a chain of trust

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,400
this verifies this which verifies this

00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:12,199
which verifies everything but there's a

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,800
chicken and egg problem the server can

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,840
still send you a different HTML file and

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,139
just remove the key or send the wrong

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,120
key or anything so number one solution

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,610
is to just cache the HTML file forever

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,279
that's trust on first use that works

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,110
reasonably well the second solution is a

00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,270
browser extension which will check a

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,399
signature on the HTML file you need to

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,320
you need to root your trust somewhere so

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,419
rooting it in a browser extension

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,969
basically you have to come back to what

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,540
what's the key that you trust that to

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,060
sign everything else so I'm gonna show

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,970
you something there is an experimental

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,990
branch which I didn't give you the name

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:59,180
of

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:01,880
and but I'm gonna show you the code I'm

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,070
sure you show you it running so this is

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,920
a little crib pad I have running on my

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,770
laptop and I'm gonna reload and it's

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,850
very boring it just loads up and does

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:17,690
what you'd expect it to do now if I were

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:28,330
to go and change a file up first I'm

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:32,000
gonna check that get status okay yeah

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm gonna check this in this is get

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:51,830
nonsense just because I did this two

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:54,770
minutes ago and okay checked in okay

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,510
cool now reload everything works

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,079
everything's fine now

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,270
if I were to go and change the code a

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,730
little bit like something like this I

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,709
added an alert here hello world right

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,300
that's that's changing the code that

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,589
that could be an attack that could be

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,120
something that sends your keys to

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:17,120
another server that could be anything

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:20,300
anything evil right reload and doesn't

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,120
work because didn't save it then you

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,160
reload and now what we're seeing here

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,050
and I'm not sure if you can see that but

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,660
basically it says that the the file that

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,880
I just changed has integrity check has

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,410
failed and so the resource has been

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,620
blocked and that's a decision that was

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,829
made by Chrome by the web browser

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,570
I can't once once you've committed to

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:47,810
this you can't work around it right and

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:50,120
in fact I can I can fix this I can get

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,140
rid of this code again and it'll work

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,860
again so go back to what it was before

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:01,010
and it it loads loads my document

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,040
everything is fine now suppose I wanted

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,110
to make an update to pad I'm gonna

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,150
put this whoops I'm gonna go back here

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:12,230
and put my

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:16,460
silly code here save now I'm gonna go in

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:20,600
to get and get DIF show you okay I've

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:24,340
made one change now I'm going to rebuild

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,260
the manifest so go through the history

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,540
until I find okay gen manifest all right

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:33,890
so we Gen manifest now I'm gonna show

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,130
you the diff now okay so what did we do

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:40,010
we changed the code there we changed the

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,290
hash of the that code here in the

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,530
manifest and we changed the hash of the

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,920
manifest here and we got a new signature

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:51,140
a signed hash of the manifest here so

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,440
there's a new signature and that new

00:11:51,140 --> 00:12:00,260
signature should work now now we've done

00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:06,740
that let's reload and what's wrong it

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:13,370
blow up integrity of the resource did I

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:16,460
fail to save oh yeah let me judge and

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,460
[Music]

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,060
restart the server as well yeah and

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,650
there we go we got hello world has just

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,150
popped up because that code now has run

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:39,430
and you'll see that once you dismiss

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:43,100
that it loads pad as it should now

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:46,070
again to go through we have a manifest

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,020
that has names of JavaScript files and

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,690
hashes of JavaScript files so that

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,550
everything is is hashed in there that

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,850
gives you the authenticity of every

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,630
JavaScript file in crypt pad then this

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,450
is the version file which contains the

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:04,940
signed hash of the manifest then that

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,940
the public key that verifies that

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,130
signature is here in in the secure boot

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:14,780
file and the secure boot file is

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:17,600
referenced here in the HTML file however

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,700
as I said the server can send you the

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,970
wrong main HTML file

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,120
but we we have one more step and that

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,370
the HTML file is signed with a PGP

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,890
signature using and I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:36,660
plug this project web xed signed pages

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:39,510
that is signed with signed pages and

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,500
signed pages is a Chrome extension which

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:46,760
will verify and you can see right here

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:50,820
that signed pages has verified that

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:56,340
crypt pad loads correctly and to show

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,470
you what happens if you change that just

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,110
go here and add and enter anything

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:06,590
doesn't doesn't matter what it is and

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:10,530
then you reload and yes it works but

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:15,240
signed pages for some reason doesn't do

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:19,140
the right thing that was the part that I

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,390
just did today anyway

00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,500
let's try something like a little bit

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,010
wait

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,380
yeah that's the right one reload okay

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,720
now when I when I actually make a change

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,570
that has significance other than adding

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,560
whitespace now you see it's turned to an

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:40,100
X you have the wrong code so signed

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,230
pages is now saying something is wrong

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,390
so there there you have it there's a

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:49,410
chain of trust that goes from a Chrome

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:52,080
extension to the HTML file to the secure

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,780
boot loader the boot loader loads a

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,520
signature that allows for updating that

00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,790
loads a manifest that loads all the

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,830
files encrypted and that way you can be

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:11,660
sure that the server is not serving you

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:16,890
the wrong data and I'm gonna let's see

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:21,860
get branch okay okay it's called code

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:29,040
integrity so I'm gonna go back to the

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:30,200
presentation and fix that there we go

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,440
so

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,910
I invite you guys and ladies to check

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,260
out this this this branch of pad I

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,030
think it's I think that's the right way

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,680
to do it

00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,840
branch no it's not it that's not the

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,320
right way to do it

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,500
take the I want the branch yeah there we

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,410
go

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:56,690
code integrity yeah that's the one I

00:15:51,410 --> 00:16:02,480
want so I'll invite an invite all of you

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:05,390
to to check out this let me go

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,270
this code integrity branch of the

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:12,080
pet project and this is something that

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:16,220
is very experimental it's been ongoing

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,760
in the last couple of days but this this

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,510
is this is like the key to making

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,780
something that goes between peer to peer

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,190
where you don't trust anybody and

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,530
client/server where you absolutely trust

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,200
the server it's more kind of like peer

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,330
to server because you don't really trust

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,610
the server but you still use a server

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,220
and you still have all the advantages of

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:45,110
just being able to load the page in the

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,750
web browser yet for the server to start

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,290
serving something that's wrong something

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,750
that's not what what the the author's

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,240
had created in that in that software

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,160
project the server that will not work so

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,220
you don't have to worry so much about

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,710
the server being hacked or the authors

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,500
being malicious you can be fairly sure

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:11,170
that what is on github that you can read

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,170
the code is what is on edit fr

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:19,839
that's that's me I'm reachable on

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:22,100
mastodons and email and matrix in fact

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,130
does anybody have any questions about

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,630
this thank you very much kind of great

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,999
told you

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,999
