Description: 
	Large cloud providers that have made their fortunes by leveraging users' personal data are facing a paradigm shift with the arrival of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While small enterprises are equally liable for protecting user data, they are well positioned to develop privacy-enhancing technologies since they are not competitive in the big-data market anyway.

There is much excitement in the crypto space, finally extending beyond the established community, but there are still many challenges to establish your enterprise as a trustworthy service provider. This presentation will explore the difficulties of cultivating a community around open-source projects, developing technologies which are difficult to coopt into proprietary platforms, and innovating in a culture where mistakes can have severe consequences. I'll share insights based on the experiences of the CryptPad development team, and how we have made crypto work for us.
