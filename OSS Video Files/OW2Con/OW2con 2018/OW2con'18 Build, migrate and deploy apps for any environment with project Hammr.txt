Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Hammr is an OW2 open source tool for creating machine images for multiple cloud, container and virtual environments, or migrating live systems between environments. From a single source configuration file - created from scratch or by scanning a live system - you can automatically build consistent, repeatable machine images for any environment. Hammr integrates into your DevOps toolchain working with other tools such as Jenkins, Chef, Puppet and SaltStack, allowing you to easily build machine images and maintain live running instances. This presentation will give an overview of how you can build images and migrate systems with Hammr, as well as presenting the latest features, including migration process improvements and the ability to deploy machine images directly to Amazon AWS, OpenStack and Microsoft Azure from the Hammr command line.
