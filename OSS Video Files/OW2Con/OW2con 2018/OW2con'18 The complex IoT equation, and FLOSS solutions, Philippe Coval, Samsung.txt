Description: 
	Even if not totally new, IoT era is bringing many new challenges to address but at a larger scale.

Market oracles are publishing various figures about the expected gross,
while security experts are alarming about their concerns.

Software developers will use as much resources they can, while hardware engineers will focus
on optimizing hardware for reducing cost of production or usage by focusing on power consumption.

IoT is involving many subdomains from electronics to radio communication or cloud backends,
and thus many skills than nobody can seriously claim to have.

The good news is that nobody is alone in the world of open standards and free software,
and cooperation is one of the key for a seamless "INTERnet of things"
where everyone can find a place in this new landscape.

To illustrate openness and interoperability, a couple of projects supported by Samsung Opensource group will be presented
and how to get kickstarted on Web+IoT Technologies.
