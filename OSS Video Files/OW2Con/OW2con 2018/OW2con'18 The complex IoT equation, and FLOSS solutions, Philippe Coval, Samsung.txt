Title: OW2con'18 The complex IoT equation, and FLOSS solutions, Philippe Coval, Samsung
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Even if not totally new, IoT era is bringing many new challenges to address but at a larger scale.

Market oracles are publishing various figures about the expected gross,
while security experts are alarming about their concerns.

Software developers will use as much resources they can, while hardware engineers will focus
on optimizing hardware for reducing cost of production or usage by focusing on power consumption.

IoT is involving many subdomains from electronics to radio communication or cloud backends,
and thus many skills than nobody can seriously claim to have.

The good news is that nobody is alone in the world of open standards and free software,
and cooperation is one of the key for a seamless "INTERnet of things"
where everyone can find a place in this new landscape.

To illustrate openness and interoperability, a couple of projects supported by Samsung Opensource group will be presented
and how to get kickstarted on Web+IoT Technologies.

[Music]

00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,950
so I would try to give them another view

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,969
about hi or tea and how open source can

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,250
be revelant so first mortal knowledge

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,210
new presents my name is Philip and I'm

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,420
working for a team in Samsung Samsung

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,160
research which is only dedicated to open

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,929
source project so that's I'm a member of

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,420
this team and I'm based in France you

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,309
know Brittany and I have a lot on to

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,579
interesting to software hardware and

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,379
community and I am someone who is ok to

00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,850
put the hand in a mud and trying to fix

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,010
things and so on so if you have some

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,230
issue with some software on presenting

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,570
don't hesitate which me we can walk

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:57,180
together so I will try to speak about

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,449
the IOT and compare it to the web and on

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,500
some Challenger we are today facing and

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:08,790
illustrate this with some demonstration

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,869
so yes when you are in a very difficult

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,430
context you need to find simplicity so

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:17,030
coyotes touch a IOT is the definition

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,030
itself it's a system of physical object

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,430
that can be controlled discovered on the

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,680
monitor read they are interacting each

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,869
other on a network and eventually can be

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
connected to the Internet but let's face

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,930
it internet is not mandatory so I will

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,390
explain this detail it applies to all

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,600
kind of domain from agriculture to an

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,140
automotive personal belongings your

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,909
smart home moon also so you can guess

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,700
there is a lot of skills are involved

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,860
you have to know everything that's

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,100
almost impossible it's gone from our

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,479
where to radio to networking to verbal

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,770
management with so many domain so

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,009
potentially a lot of issue so you have

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,250
to focus on one thing and trying to have

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,789
good team wins other people too who

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,649
trying to make something really

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:13,640
functional and are so secure so today I

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:19,080
will try to explain

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:23,880
now first let's let's have a look about

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:28,620
I was a weapon IOT or differing so maybe

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,709
I asked do you know when the first IOT

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,280
device was connected to a network on the

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,030
Internet

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,370
so it was not in year 2000 but in the

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,370
early 90s so the resource of someone who

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,230
made a coke vending machine and he made

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,120
this proof of concept so that's funny to

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,310
know that is what it took on before the

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,860
World Wide Web

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,840
so in terms of architecture the web is

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,440
quite easy because it's a client-server

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,230
architecture we have some free basically

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,580
an amount you can try to build more than

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:05,000
send things from HTTP HTML HT Aaron and

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,709
unify the resource requests shown scheme

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,470
for IOT it's totally different you have

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,130
a lot of different protocols lot of

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,680
different context so that's something

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,269
which is trying to be standardized as a

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,700
good thing that's the same for the web

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:25,739
and in terms of hardware supporting

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,870
device for IOT you have everything from

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,230
very low hand device to high hand

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,060
devices so that's you won't find a

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,750
software stack that will run everywhere

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,170
so the bad news is that the good news is

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,650
that it's already deployed that we have

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:47,120
near to 8 billion of device on the

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,489
market today but we don't have many

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,500
developers to develop them so that's can

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,239
be a problem if we compare to the web

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,269
it's totally the opposite so web to

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,910
cover but in a very longer term and we

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:05,970
have a 10 million developer so maybe

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:09,590
more so let's start with some challenge

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:14,070
and I don't have any time but I want to

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,690
detail one feature of one value because

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,539
I believe it meets matters a lot is

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,430
about the privacy domain so privacy and

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,830
security is something different they are

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,760
tied together so we only focus on the

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,539
privacy today so privacy is about trust

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,470
and

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:33,150
and about the data ownership so what you

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,729
need to know is that your personal data

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,910
can be shared can be login can be

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,270
replicate and if still personal you

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,729
should have the control on this and

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:49,080
hopefully now the European Commission

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,880
establish a rule new rule into personal

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,210
data and as now there is a new

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,500
obligation from cloud provider or savvy

00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,630
online provider and regarding personal

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,870
data so you're probably been spun all

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,360
the previous months receiving time of

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,099
service update and so on so I won't go

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,500
too far in detail in this because that

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,630
the text is quite difficult to read and

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,789
even from software developer it's not a

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,720
specification in your beer able to

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:21,090
implement easy so how to do with this

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
so either we try to comply the

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,409
regulation how we try to do the things

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,569
right in the first place instead of

00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,030
collecting data and trying to protecting

00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,639
it maybe we can just avoid the

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,639
collection and make a system user can

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,340
use have the same user experience and

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,590
without dealing about taking care of its

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,949
personal data in some case there is no

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:50,580
value to do this so let me try to

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:53,460
explain this with a very very simple

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,440
example imagine you are renting a house

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,900
for your holiday and this is Mother's

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,610
you have cameras and or the room of the

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,810
so I was wouldn't you feel a bit

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,780
uncomfortable

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,310
of course yes because you have no idea

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,460
who is watching you so that's the

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,319
problem so if we want to and you should

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,219
be able to use all the smart house

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:21,930
devices and make sure that only you can

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:24,960
get access to it and control it so so we

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,380
have two different people in this this

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,020
is a Raja beam no where is it oh there

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,020
is known anyway so in my example we have

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:38,339
two different world one is a householder

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,039
and the other is a house winter there

00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,860
are stablishing a contract and decide to

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:48,059
access to the resource of the house and

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:52,860
once the period of renter is over then

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:56,069
you can the the occupier of the house

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,680
can decide to unlock the house and give

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,240
it back to the to this owner and

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,789
eventually reset the system to make sure

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:09,210
is data are not used for any malicious

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:13,680
use so I try to implement this problem

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,939
using Mozilla coyote getaway so let me

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,919
show this so this is my desk it's a bit

00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,669
fuzzy so here is a Mozilla I ought to

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,189
get away it's running on a Raspberry Pi

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,719
so this is a the great way we're

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,819
supposed to support the house there is

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:34,229
some sensor and higher is my application

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,569
I can view all the device and here is a

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,270
fan I'm turning on with my remote

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,279
control so everything is running on the

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,939
local network here you can have access

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,209
remote access Zen I'm connecting a micro

00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:53,189
controller which is running on a

00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:56,129
esp8266 micro controller and it's acting

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:59,639
as a as a color light so I'm connecting

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:02,699
into the system and I can decide to turn

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,649
on this in a local network so I can

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:11,779
change the properties of the device and

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:14,459
that's how it works so this code is

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,979
public you can try it on it will cost

00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:21,719
you maybe five euros so that can be

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:23,639
found from well we can project so this

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,389
is the model I get away and now I made

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:31,559
an html5 application running on Tizen

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:33,690
mobile so this is a web app and it's

00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:37,889
also connecting to the getaway so I'm

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,039
showing you so how to register this is

00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,630
only one time for the first time you

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,990
install the hub you have to login to

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:49,949
your getaway and then retrieve the

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,600
resource so in my case I'm using your

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:55,480
local network you can use a remote

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,420
network also because mod 0 is for

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,819
back to nurse and one connected I can

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,279
decide which resource I want to access

00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:05,130
so if you're configuring the the phone

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,079
of your kid and you don't want him to

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:13,170
have access to dangerous device of the

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:16,690
home you can decide to deny this once

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,930
the resource that discovered you can

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:25,389
remote control them so here is the same

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:28,500
fun and the lump and are also attached

00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:32,130
to to get away to sensor one for the

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:37,600
temperature and the other is for the

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:40,089
bright ambient light sensor so that's it

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,660
and then I can explain how to work in

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:45,220
detail so this is not very there is no

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,630
black magic involved here it's very

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,759
simple so we already talked about the

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,899
rest it's the base of the it's a very

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,329
popular protocol in IOT so from the HTTP

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,339
GET and put post verb you can create

00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,540
something more advanced when you have

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:08,139
action on a subject so the verbs have

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,959
HTTP events and the action is HTTP verbs

00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:14,560
and the subject in a URL so if we look

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,360
at the my command line first this is at

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,790
rest of the gateway can be remote or

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,170
local depends if you home isn't can not

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,970
be connected to the Internet it should

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,800
work also and each things have different

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,509
end paths and you can access to the

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,490
property so here I'm reading the

00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,139
property and if I'm sending a put

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:37,959
request I will change the color of the

00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:42,939
light so if you're looking in my green

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,980
and red square you see that I'm using

00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,899
different protocols so using HTTP in a

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,750
local network is could be perfectly fine

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,459
but we can do better

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,160
the problem is that so you cannot buy

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:58,540
the HTTP on a very small controller so

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,550
to solve this the internet and general

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,199
text testing first try to solve this by

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,449
adapting the HTTP scandalised using more

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,750
constraint protocol so basically I'm

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,260
doing

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:14,050
the same on UDP instead of satirizing

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,700
JSON streams are using binary more

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:20,740
conceals and this is the base of the IOT

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,940
VT framework which is a open-source

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:28,030
software of the open connectivity

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,340
specification and this goal of this

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,820
project try to provide seamless

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,050
connectivity between devices so

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,270
virtually all the device control

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,820
together seamlessly that's what we want

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,190
to achieve we have different sub project

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,940
one is for microcontrollers and there is

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,490
a node wrapper also so you can use it

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,320
from JavaScript if you not by the

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,160
developers that can be easier for you

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,200
and something interesting is that there

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,600
is also an initiative to define common

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,810
semantics which mean what is the core of

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,580
what is a on/off switch what is the

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:08,800
speed what is all those physical element

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,570
how content can be named in the same way

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,520
so then the device can talk the same

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:17,950
language so how about JavaScript he was

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,170
very popular in some of our Samsung

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:25,540
project

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:28,780
ok so let me travel script this language

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,640
that really was very successful in a web

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,589
and everything that could be write in

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,600
JavaScript will be written in JavaScript

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:37,930
someday so that's something not neglect

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,180
so the community is very is growing now

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:45,550
if you look at this short the red line

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,190
here is the number of NPM packages

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,690
that's growing pretty fast so I'm not

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:54,400
talking about the quality but about the

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:56,910
quantity and at samseong we made a part

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,330
of it's not a part actually so

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:03,940
implementation of JavaScript interpreter

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:09,339
for very constrained environment so we

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:12,280
have a JavaScript runtime on which is a

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,410
fitting in a very small amount of RAM 64

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,060
K and you can put this on

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,650
microcontroller as well so that's

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,980
pretend to sing if you want to develop

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:23,640
applications you can write them in Java

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,380
and you don't have to deploy over again

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,840
the same torsion and so on so for

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,430
software maintenance is quite trivalent

00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,740
you can try it on a raspbian on the

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:37,290
Raspberry Pi or so now to finish just a

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,450
proof of concept illustration I present

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:45,120
in the earlier so here is I have an

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:48,150
optic the random board is cortex and

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,800
three and four CPU and I'm connected to

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,350
it

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,290
Laura get away and as sensor error on

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,270
Tina sorry so if I'm putting some gas on

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,370
the sensor then no notification is sent

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,020
to the rural network so all this

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:05,100
demonstration was written in JavaScript

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:08,700
using the Tizen LT ho s and IOT dodgiest

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,510
one time so when this we can make some

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:19,200
very funny so here is a details of the

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:22,680
of the software sort of I'm using a loja

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,730
sheep from microchip which is a very

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,160
easy to integrate and then it's now I'm

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,000
showing some trace so it's trying to

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,780
connect to the network

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,390
I was hiding my keys and in a few steps

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,700
you can't connect it to the to the

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,970
network so don't keep in mind we are not

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:46,980
doing fibre channel here this is a very

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:49,050
constrained bandwidth so you don't think

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,090
about using Lowa

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,640
as a replacement of Wi-Fi this is not

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,460
same technology so it's based more the

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,320
size of SMS you will send each day of

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,430
maybe a couple of time a day you know

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,230
not more so now we can do on this

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,670
demonstration is trying to get the

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,500
position about this sensor what what was

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,380
when was high when there was this

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,100
presence of a dangerous gas so to do

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,720
this we can do this using and also

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,620
device so there is the last time I'm

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,900
showing the demonstration okay this is

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,900
technical so I can I can skip it

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:35,299
so yeah I try to put it on a bicycle on

00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:38,029
battery it's working and to get the

00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:41,479
position of the place I'm using a phone

00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:43,609
with a GPS and to connect to the system

00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:46,129
I'm using the i/o tivity framework which

00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:49,220
is a server is on the phone and the

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:53,109
client is on my development board so

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:56,689
that's a very rough proof-of-concept but

00:15:53,109 --> 00:16:02,299
it was possible using all the project I

00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:04,579
explained before so you have the server

00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:09,769
is running on the phone and you see the

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:12,769
client running on the the development

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,779
board is running on Tizen energy and so

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:21,679
you have the discovery of the resource

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:27,589
and then the value is updated so we can

00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:30,199
move forward then so last slide so I

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,479
explained about coyote and web and there

00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,489
is a conventions between people from the

00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:36,859
web and people from the IOT world with

00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:40,249
trying to trying to make something is

00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:44,359
more integrated this means we can link

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:47,509
the web and the coyote more easily using

00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:49,819
some web technologies so I talked about

00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,789
rest before when we can do a bit more

00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:55,639
than that we can had some intelligence

00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:58,669
to the how things by deploying scripts

00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,399
on devices that's a possibility in the

00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:06,679
description of that is also something of

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:09,529
an important topic so we have the w3c

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,470
consortium which trying to publish and

00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:16,220
push the web of Things specification and

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:20,990
Mozilla has another proposal which is

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,939
most improve it about it and the next

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,620
challenge is trying to align on the

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,449
semantics because there is no need to

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,820
overlap so that's something you should

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,919
care about but don't please don't try to

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,370
reinvent the wheel if there is something

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,040
specified in the

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,900
open source and the open standard you

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,400
should care about this and away you will

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,110
not pay your technical depth in the

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,030
future

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,610
so in summary we have a massive adoption

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,100
of the web we have a very originals

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,530
Internet of Things so today there is a

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,660
lot of silos and we can break this if we

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,540
are working together are trying to build

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,840
this web of things and reduce the

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,340
complexity of a MIDI development for

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,190
application developers we are

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,080
comfortable on the web today so that's

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,880
the next challenge

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,780
I believe that private privacy by design

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,900
is something that should not be ignored

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,650
by the sea there is success I fight it

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,170
probably depends on this and there is so

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,870
many project you can evaluate so feel

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,180
free to join and if there is something

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,770
I'm missing don't hesitate to tell me

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,770
something I'm looking for four instances

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:34,390
how to implement

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,860
gdpr words in in a generic way I have

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,390
made some research and I don't find any

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,970
so you have some ok so now I'm here some

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,460
resources i'm opens up for question and

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,200
if you don't have if I have time I will

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:53,700
show you one more video satsang

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,700
