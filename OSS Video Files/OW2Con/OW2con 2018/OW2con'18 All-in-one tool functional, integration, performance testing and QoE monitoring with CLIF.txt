Title: OW2con'18 All-in-one tool functional, integration, performance testing and QoE monitoring with CLIF
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	Among the numerous challenges of DevOps, seamlessly coping with the proliferation of tools dedicated to functional testing, performance testing and monitoring tasks is key to delivery efficiency.
This presentation shows through a practical and simple use case how CLIF may be used throughout all these tasks, from development to operations. Leveraging its embedded scenario language, test scenarios may be used for functional and integration tests, performance testing, as well as quality of experience monitoring. Coming with an integration to Eclipse and Jenkins, and generating measurements that may be easily consumed by common log collectors, CLIF tooling naturally fits DevOps environments.
