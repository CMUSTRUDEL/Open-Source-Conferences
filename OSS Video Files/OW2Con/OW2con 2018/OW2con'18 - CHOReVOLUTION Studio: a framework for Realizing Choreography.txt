	CHOReVOLUTION Studio: a framework for Realizing Choreography-based Distributed Applications: 

CHOReVOLUTION Studio is an innovative Eclipse-based development environment that supports the realization of secure and dynamic service based applications, e.g., in the Smart Mobility and Tourism domains, built as composition of third-party services. The Studio offers a set of wizards that easily guide developers through the entire development process, from defining a choreography-based specification of the system, to the selection of the involved services, from the automatic synthesis of the software artifacts required to build the system, to the their deployment on the cloud. The development process is driven by models and is realized by aptly defined model transformations that automatize the code generation steps. The process is organized into two sub-processes, namely the "CHOReVOLUTION Service/Thing specification process" and the "CHOReVOLUTION Synthesis process". The former is aimed to service providers which can publish their own services in a service inventory by providing, e.g., interface models, security policy models. The latter is intended to domain experts, software engineers and business managers that cooperate each other to set their business goals, define a choreography-based specification of the system to be realized, select the required services in the inventory, and automatically generate the code for composing and securing the entire application.
