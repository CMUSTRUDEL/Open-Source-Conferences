00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:12,030
thank you so this is the last

00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,530
presentation of the conference and the

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,109
idea with this conference is to give you

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,300
the context exactly why we're doing this

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,340
project and cause minor for instance in

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,369
particular in particular cross mine is

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,300
to be able to provide tools that can

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,449
help our projects position themselves in

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,920
terms of readiness with regard to the

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,660
market the market out there and in the

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,850
market out there in fact it's not just

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:46,469
your next door or you're a developer

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,840
friend who's a an IT professional like

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,469
you are and we feel very comfortable

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,809
with what you're developing now the

00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,329
market out there is the average decision

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,859
maker so what we're thinking of is the

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,870
conventional decision maker who's never

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,280
heard of open source was probably more

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,070
comfortable with buying proprietary

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,080
software and who might feel that open

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,600
source can be evil and is heard that

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,689
open source is not right etc etcetera so

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,360
we won't say no this a piece of open

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,770
source code is right you can go for it

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,290
so that's the idea and the thing is

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,630
between the developer and that user of

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,570
just talked about the there is quite a

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,700
distance quite a great distance it's not

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,640
like setting or showing the piece of

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,070
code or debugging it online as we've

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,310
seen this morning but it's really a

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,430
question of reaching out to somebody who

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,670
might not be a developer at all not an

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,390
IT person at all and for this person's

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,630
what the developer does is not something

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,060
that can use for the layman I don't know

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:59,399
if you are musicians here in the room

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,610
but code is a bit like this this is not

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,710
complete when you have this you only

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,079
have part of the story and the average

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,209
decision maker doesn't want that what

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,209
the average decision maker is this

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:31,069
[Music]

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:36,620
what you've just heard is what you could

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:38,749
see on the screen the final product what

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,480
has value is not just the code is

00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:46,310
something that has code like this text

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,159
but also a whole sort of things that

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,879
create the actual market value and

00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,459
talking about software

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,560
it means documentation for you it's

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,560
basic it's been something that has been

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,669
tested it means something that have a

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,109
plan for upgrades bug fixing training

00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:07,760
packaging case studies collateral

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,719
pricing contracts even other other users

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,629
other uses

00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,609
I mean I've as an average come decision

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,079
maker I feel comfortable in the company

00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:17,209
of all the users I don't want to be the

00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:20,329
first one etcetera it's specially with

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,639
the open source software they want a

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:25,819
sense of predictability where's this

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:31,370
project going a sense of quality can we

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:35,299
all trust that's what we want to the the

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,889
kind of need these customers have so

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,379
research and development does what we

00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,720
have you have on the left and what the

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:43,400
customer want the custom is completely

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,650
on the other right and the the gap

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,900
between is what we use you call a

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,400
totally to the delivery challenge this

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:56,120
delivery challenge is usually covered

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,090
addressed by the ecosystem not just the

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,009
developers but distributors systems

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,709
integrators communities contributors and

00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,739
open source organizations we are part of

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,989
the ocular system and other users of the

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,949
users that can share experience best

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:17,750
practices that's what the average and

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:23,210
I'm talking the average decision-maker

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:27,650
want so we want to give them the

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:33,259
elements the data the arguments the

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:37,130
resources to decide in confidence the

00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:40,020
idea is really that one architect can

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,849
tell his or her manager

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,400
they are using this piece of that piece

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:47,190
of open-source software for a reason and

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,039
that is okay no need to to worry no

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,940
worries in fact there is an analogy in

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,190
what we do in NIT it's the energy of the

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,919
car industry you know the car

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,220
manufacturers you know don't manufacture

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:06,750
half of the of the cars they assemble

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,449
components entire parts pieces of the

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,569
cars come from third-party providers the

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,610
whole dashboard the whole front of the

00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:18,080
car including with the lights these are

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,870
blocks that come together huge component

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,509
the the whole seats the seats the

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,669
leather the whatever that is provided by

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,590
third party everything all the windows

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:32,430
everything that glass is providing is

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,009
provided by third party providers a car

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,849
manufacturer today does not manufacture

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:42,599
a car a car manufacturer today conceives

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:45,120
a car a car manufacturer today offers

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,550
the car that meets the needs of our

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,169
segment that's what they do and they

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,110
have the marketing and the financing and

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:55,139
the delivery and the network etc so

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,919
that's what we do in the in nit when we

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:03,270
develop code we don't develop code we

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:06,509
assemble most of it this is a stats from

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:10,740
sauna type and analysis of over 2000

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:13,229
developers that shows that 80 to 90

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,620
percent of a typical application is

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,479
composed is composed of components this

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,310
components many of them we think are

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,449
open-source confidence obviously

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,969
probably majority of them I don't

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,789
exactly but let's assume that there are

00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:29,849
open source components and what we want

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,219
we want to help the average architect

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:35,130
who's going to build an application by

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:37,979
selecting a project from a w-2 to be

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,819
able to tell his or her manager that

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:44,909
death selection that's choice is safe we

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,289
want to make them easy to select and

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,960
we're not the only one

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,270
addressing this need I mean metrics

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,649
knowing what's about what the component

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,770
what's in the component it's something

00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,810
that has been around for some

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,849
time we've been when we started thinking

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,669
about that six years ago we realized

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:04,180
there were many projects so Assad

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,490
mentioned OSS meter we were part in

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,289
riscos that was now cross mine of course

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,180
is part of this and then there are other

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:16,479
a number of initiatives all aiming at

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,310
understanding what's in components where

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,750
they go and it's true that we use

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,419
platforms we use development

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,720
environments that generates a huge

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:29,380
amount of data we can grab this data

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,550
make sense out of it the question is we

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,349
have done that already

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,120
we've set up a Scott that I already

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,960
introduced a couple of times which is

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,280
both mythology in a platform to grab

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,590
information and we can publish a lot of

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,259
information we have information you can

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,240
look at the dashboard of each project or

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,419
the b2 project and they have a dashboard

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,940
with a lot of data data from all the

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,639
tools we use data and information

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:58,900
covering licenses communities quality

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,460
the code etc but then it's presented

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,539
like this you have to make sense out of

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,639
that what we what we think is that the

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,460
average decision-maker does not want to

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,810
look at these charts

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,800
the average decision-maker want

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:19,440
something like that a scale is this

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,580
thing okay for me or is it just a

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,770
half-baked and useless for me and when

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,039
we were thinking of that we had a very

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,149
easy example to follow that from the

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,860
NASA the technology readiness levels the

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:39,719
technology readiness levels is a type of

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,279
measurement systems just to evaluate the

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,079
maturity of a particular technology with

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,440
some rules and they define the certain

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:51,959
number numbers and it's been found

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:55,420
useful it's been reused by the DoD

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,920
depart for energy as well and now it's

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,910
something you see in every proposal of

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,529
projects submitted to the European

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,899
Commission thing is

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,779
that's what the NASA DoD technology

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,860
readiness actually looks like at the

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,480
bottom you have the thing that is

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,410
useless there are the basic principles

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,379
observed and reported then halfway you

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:23,970
have the the test the trials tries in

00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:26,790
more a more realistic conditions and

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,920
then at the top you have the level

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,410
reached by the the thing that went

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,559
around the earth or and came back if

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,809
you'd have to come back so we thought

00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,809
