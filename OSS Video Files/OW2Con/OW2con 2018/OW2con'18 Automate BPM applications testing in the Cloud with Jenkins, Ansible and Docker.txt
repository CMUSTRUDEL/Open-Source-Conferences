Title: OW2con'18 Automate BPM applications testing in the Cloud with Jenkins, Ansible and Docker
Publication date: 2018-06-13

Description: 
	Applications build on top of a BPM platform share a key aspect in common with all other applications: they must be tested! But how can tests be automated when an application requires a specific build process and a specific server to run?
In this talk I’ll highlight how we built a solution to automate the build, packaging, deployment and test of Bonita process-based applications using well known developer and DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker and Ansible. I’ll explain why we think that using the cloud for testing environments is a nifty idea, and also how to make sure that ultimately, solutions can be easily deployed on the cloud.
