Title: OW2con'18 On GDPR compliance, the Right to be forgotten and Artificial Intelligence
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	The right to be forgotten took the spotlight among privacy rights especially after the ruling C-131/12 Google v. Gonzales from the European Court of Justice in 2012, stating that as a data controller Google needs to comply to requests on deletion from data subjects. The effect was that hundreds of thousands demanded erasure from the search index. What was Google's response to those requests and how do tech companies prepare to address the new GDPR - where respecting the right to be forgotten is a demand for compliance? What does the law intend to say when it speaks about deletion and what are the consequences of not complying? Also, why AI is such a particular subject in this discussion and what ways were tried until now in the research world to ensure protection of data under the right to be forgotten? Considering the nature of machine learning systems, is it possible to proverbially make an AI system forget? This presentation will propose potential answers to these questions; also, it will address the topic of how humans forget and why ultimately this is as relevant as the ways machines do.

[Music]

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,090
so hello everyone i'm christina and i

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,090
would like to thank you all for choosing

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,460
to attend this presentation it's level

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,710
it's for beginners so i will not speak

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,690
about anything that is complex about the

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,359
law or about the artificial intelligence

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,460
world first of all i would like to ask

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,939
you all how many of you have heard about

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,910
the gdpr

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,219
okay and second of all how many of you

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,380
can can surely state that the company

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,309
you are working for is indeed gdpr

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,590
compliant

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,629
well one fact about the gdpr is that

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,820
nobody can truly say that they really

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,010
comply with it and this is like to make

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,289
an analogy like stating for example that

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,379
like like stating that we comply with

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,600
the criminal code one cannot say that or

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,489
obtain a prior certification that we

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,199
comply with the criminal quote this is

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,680
something to be decided by a certain

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,109
Authority in a particular situation so I

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,699
start with a comparison between the

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,640
human mind and the artificial

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,010
intelligence mind in one of his books

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,900
Cicero was telling us the story of Tami

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,729
Stockley who made an interesting choice

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,600
back in the antiquity instead of

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,460
learning to master the art of

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,530
remembering he chose to master the art

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,590
of forgetting the arts oblivion olives

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,900
and this was because of two reasons the

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,390
first one being the fact that he was

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,820
unable to expressly forget something

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
that was in his mind and second of all

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,759
because everything that he ever saw and

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,729
heard was just unable to to get out of

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,369
his mind and as important as it was to

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,110
to mastered yars oblivion alleys it

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,509
turns out that there is a paradox and

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,079
the paradox is the fact that we cannot

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,970
remember to forget something to make a

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,909
demonstration if I tell you for example

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,280
please don't think about the GDP are you

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,640
at this moment will think about the GDP

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,320
are so Alberto Ecco stated because of

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,270
this reason the fact that there is no

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,610
such thing as an art of forgetting as an

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,619
art of oblivion artists now in the

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,660
research world cognitive psychologists

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,459
are talking about two systems of memory

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,410
or the long-term memory and the

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,650
short-term memory even though they they

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,209
saw

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,549
have agree with lots of things about

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,790
these two they don't agree on two

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,489
aspects the first one is related to how

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,799
much can the human mind store and the

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,340
second one is why exactly are we

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,349
offering up meaning to certain things

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,390
and we remember them yet we so easily

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:40,590
forget other stuff okay on the other

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,659
hand the so-called AI mind is not really

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,609
reasoning on the same logic as humans

00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,319
however what is important to notice is

00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:48,739
the fact that humans are the one always

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,359
in control with the machine so

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,940
ultimately it matters how humans are

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,980
forgetting not how up how well the

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,590
system is forgetting now regarding the

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,420
AI we can we can state for for certain

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,849
that AI systems are definitely

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,650
remembering better than we are and about

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:09,269
forgetting we can say that AI and we

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,430
understand generically about the AI

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,139
three main aspect we have the data input

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,659
which is clearly defined at the

00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,239
beginning yet it lat it lacks meaning

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,280
for the machine we have the storage of

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
the memory which is or a progress

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,750
compared to humans and also we have the

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,340
deletion aspect which does not face the

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,299
forgetting paradox I was telling you

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,489
about now let's see what is AI I

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:39,030
categorized artificial intelligence in

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,579
this matter first we have the notion of

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,290
reinforcement learning and this is more

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,340
general this is more generic AI is

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,349
related to robotics to gaming and it's

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,049
related basically to the behavior that

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,329
we are expected to have and if they

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,060
manage to guess it then it gets so it

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,220
gets a cookie secondly we have here the

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,319
notion of neural networks and deep

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,359
learning that haphazard model what we

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,459
can see in this image and in this image

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,949
we can notice an input layer at the

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,260
beginning a hidden layer and in this

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,729
case we see a multiple multiple layers

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,489
where where we can find different

00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,010
variables and an output that can be

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,840
something looking like an input for

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,570
example in the situation of a dictionary

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,060
or something totally different or from

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,000
another class and the backpropagation

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,950
algorithm has practically as bad

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,200
is the same logic as the notion of

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,540
reinforcement learning the system of up

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,070
votes and down votes and over time

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,800
basically up if the information gets

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,840
right the system gets reinforced if it's

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,640
wrong then it gets corrected that means

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,410
that over time the system becomes more

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,410
powerful by this trial and error

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,450
mechanism now even though the research

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,850
well does not really agree on lots of

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,460
stuff regarding what's going on in the

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,190
in the hidden layer in the so called job

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,070
black box of the art of the of the

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,840
neural network uh what what we do

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,180
understand by the system of trial and

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,460
error is the fact that the quality of

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,260
the data is fundamental and this raises

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,660
a direct question of what is happening

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,340
if we choose to delete something from

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,900
from inside the neural network but what

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,520
is the right to be forgotten because

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,290
this is the reason why we choose to

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,050
delete something practically it's the

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,240
right of the individual to obtain

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,300
automatically or by request the deletion

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,090
of personal information that was that is

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,760
no longer relevant or useful and which

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,430
was posted online by either the data

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,100
owner himself or by a third party and

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,300
even if initially it was legally posted

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,550
and I would like to sustain in this

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,830
presentation the fact that in the name

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,630
that the right to be forgotten

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,430
ultimately is related to the way humans

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,630
are forgetting and not the way machines

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,030
are now let's see which are the relevant

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,070
texts regarding the notion the notion of

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,160
the right to be forgotten we have first

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,050
here are the directive from 1995 which

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,060
was invoked into a second decision on

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,100
the decision now of the European Court

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,919
of Justice regarding Google Spain and

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,010
Google incorporating incorporated versus

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,800
mr. Gonzalez and also we have article 17

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,800
which became well often article 17 from

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,150
the gdpr which became a reality in May

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,040
entitled suggestively the right to be

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:28,830
forgotten now what happened in this case

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,010
and why is it so important for us mr.

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,810
Gonzalez back in 1998 notice that every

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,570
time he was entering on google google

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,539
and was googling his name a certain

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,770
notice from mom from from mom from

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,960
something way and

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,000
past was appearing it was about him not

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,770
being able to pay a certain debit in the

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,800
past and basically he decided at that

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:54,030
point to list his our house for auction

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,490
in the La Vanguardia newspaper and at

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,349
some point after after like 10 years or

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,509
so he decided that that information is

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,909
not relevant to be attached to his name

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,610
so he decided to go to the newspaper and

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,740
say oh please newspaper delete me but

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,080
the newspapers answered La Vanguardia as

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,539
one was the fact that the information

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,039
initially was legally posted so there's

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,919
no reason why to delete it so the

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,789
information remained there then he went

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,340
to the Spanish canal which is the AAPD

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,889
and the answer of the AAPD was the same

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,199
and confronted with this situation he

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,849
decided to go to the Spanish Court this

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,550
passion in the Spanish national court

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,710
and a Spanish national court decided at

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,889
that point to ask the European Court of

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,139
Justice three preliminary questions and

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,030
the answers were the following regarding

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,060
the first one the the European Court of

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,610
Justice decided that the directive from

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,190
95 applies directly to Google

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,349
incorporated in the US and not to Google

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,000
Spain to the second one the European

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:56,250
Court of Justice said that the search

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,169
engine qualifies as a data controller

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,810
which means more regulations than the

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:03,630
situation in which it would have been up

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,759
data processor and not the answer to the

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,590
third question became the definition of

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,590
the right to be forgotten that was

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:16,409
replaced on May 25th with the the

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,870
article 17 from the gdpr now let's talk

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,550
about some statistics regarding

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:24,180
companies and the GDP our this is a

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,270
study conducted on 750 IT companies from

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,120
US UK France and Spain and to the

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,969
question is your company if your company

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,829
receives a request based on the right to

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,529
be forgotten what is the method that you

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:40,140
would use or to delete the content they

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,469
answer that basic deletion is one of the

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,540
most preferred method this meaning that

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,459
for example this meaning practically

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,820
dragging files from the desktop and

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,010
moving them to the recycle bin and this

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,180
does not provide a physical proof of

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,100
erasure for exam

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,690
in a situation of an audit and by the

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,810
way this is not applied through AI

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,060
systems now this is a list of number of

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:07,260
requests that were made to Google after

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,730
the ruling of of Google versus Gonzalez

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,100
case at the European Court of Justice

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,770
and the source is a transparency report

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,230
that Google published after organizing

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,779
to comply with the decision that was

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,910
taken in the Gonzalez case practically

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,730
Google's response was to hire dozens of

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,089
lawyers and organize an advisory council

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,550
in 2014 in order to analyze requests and

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,649
determine whether they should be they

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,899
should be accepted or not at the

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,630
national level what is interesting is

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,730
that here in France dick Neil was the

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,649
first stop advice was the first

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,010
Authority national authority to ask

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:51,260
Google to extend app research to extend

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:55,020
up its removals globally in June 2015

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,510
now here we can see some criteria for

00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,520
evaluating requests received by Google

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,880
and neither of them is determinant per

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,890
se and there is also no hierarchical

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,740
order between them the first one is the

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,120
role of the subject in the public life

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,550
so basically if we speak about the

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,260
public person that information might be

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,750
relevant for the public then we have the

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,490
nature of the information and this can

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,950
balance more on the side of protecting

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,110
privacy or can balance more on the side

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,240
of the public interests for example in a

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,089
situation of a crime it's important for

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
us to know then we have the source of

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,660
the information which refers to the

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,490
motivation of publishing so for example

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,250
if the information was initially posted

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,940
and a very important news and in a very

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,100
important paper it's difficult to get it

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,310
down from there and time is also a

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,529
factor and this is for example very

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,770
relevant in criminal cases because after

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,779
a certain time if we create if we

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,480
committed something that's not like a

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,850
small crime it's not so relevant to read

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,709
about it after 20 years for example

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,200
because that stuff sort of gets attached

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:06,329
to our name and it's not ok it affects

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,740
our reputation now what happened however

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,470
with or with

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,810
Quest's that google accepted now if we

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,640
make a quick search on google we can

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,560
actually find on different sources

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
information about those requests and

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,370
this happened for example in the case of

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,980
gonzalez of mr. gonzalez who initially

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,260
wanted more privacy but at the end it

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,180
ended up being everywhere because he

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,940
became famous even this presentation I'm

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,730
speaking about him and the thing is

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,980
reputational management sites weren't as

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,870
the fact of a boomerang effect because

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,030
if we draw attention to a certain

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,530
information we actually make everybody

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,390
more curious to find out information

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,970
about it and this is something that

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,800
might happen in the case when we we ask

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,280
in the name of the gdpr to delete

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,760
something even when a delete one when a

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,370
request used to be deleted by Google in

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,760
in the place up where the information

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,760
was initially listed we could see a

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,040
notice saying that this information was

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:10,130
was de listed in the name of the right

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:13,080
to be forgotten and also there are some

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,240
ok there there are some more sites that

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,340
collect delete the links removed and

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,280
also Wikipedia at some point collected

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:24,480
links that were removed removed from

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:27,300
from from Google and so basically it's

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,560
not really it's not really forgetting

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,120
no thank you ah now here we can see what

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,490
is happening when the day tag gets

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,500
removed from the search index this is

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,170
for my squirrel but applies to all the

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,330
most relevant databases currently

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,550
existed in Figure one we can see the

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,100
database before deletion and we have

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,890
five records sitting in spaces c1 and c5

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,780
and the start which is I and the end

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,220
which is s and then on record c3 we can

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,050
see that it is linked to the garbage

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,270
offset which is a collection of the

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,450
deleted records and it's currently

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,370
available for free space and when the

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,150
database practically is searching for

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,490
the data Bob starts at node I and

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:14,040
follows the path of the arrows until the

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,770
search data is found and if the search

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,380
arrives at node s with no result then

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,050
the data is not found and as a

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,730
conclusion nor

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,899
not really a complete deletion of the

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,899
information because the information

00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:30,560
still remains there and it will be

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,779
deleted when the space will be needed to

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,970
be available for other information to

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,130
appear there and this raises a direct

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,779
question of what is exactly deletion in

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,029
the spirit of the right to be forgotten

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,880
is it practically a simple a simple

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,779
removal from the search index or is over

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,089
writing in the file system or we wanted

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,440
removed from all internal mechanisms now

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,100
the answer to this question is very

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,870
important because each one of these

00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,110
methods in reality have a different

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,390
economic value and it's so it's quite

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,029
problematic and this is a realistic

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,500
quote from Vivian reading the European

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,450
Commission's were commissioned

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,300
vice-president at the time of the Google

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:16,910
versus Gonzalez case at the European

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:19,040
Court of Justice now here you can see

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,430
the major investors currently in the AI

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,100
technology and a glimpse of the amount

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,230
of the information that they are taking

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,790
from us currently we can speak about

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,470
another paradox we sort of are

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,579
confronted with a situation of having to

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,399
have different object we are confronted

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,560
with a situation of needing a LinkedIn

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,750
account a Facebook account a Twitter

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,760
account and so on but yet we are so

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,890
focusing on protecting our privacy at

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,020
the same time and people sometimes not

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,660
informed voluntarily give away their

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,089
data and they are not so informed about

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,550
the risks that are implied for example

00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,980
who used to read privacy notice wrote

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,959
notices before the gdpr now hopefully

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,020
the gdpr will manage to raise awareness

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,020
about about the risks of sharing our

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,390
data now how is exactly this amount this

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,220
huge amount of personal data used by

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,980
these companies they are first of all

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,690
money capitalizing it which is not such

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,180
a big secret and second of all they are

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,910
using it in order to improve their AI

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,190
research to deliver better in production

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,920
of course the progress of science is not

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:31,160
so bad per se but the problem is though

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,680
we need to consent to be a part of that

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,440
now here we can see a status of the AI

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,440
systems and there

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,610
and this is an image for my research and

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,589
the significant part about the research

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,170
world in general is confidential so this

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,880
is something which is public these are

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,279
some examples that I could have found

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,350
publicly and we can see here that in the

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,320
first image the AI classifies it as a

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,500
panda with self with 60% confidence and

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,170
if we apply a tiny adversarial

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,570
perturbation or the effect after this is

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:10,180
that the AI classified it as a Gibbon

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:12,370
with 99% confidence and this is another

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,649
example this is actually 8 balls most

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,440
advanced face ID technology and it was

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,870
branded as being able to detect with the

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,390
detector if someone is hacking into your

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,149
phone with the probability of 1 in 1

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,160
million and in this situation it

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:33,220
couldn't have tell the difference

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:35,890
between these two coworkers now how do

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,709
we control forgetting on the web in a

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,990
way specific to algorithmic memory we

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:43,209
have a tactic called observation which

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,700
dates back in the Second World War and

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:48,040
it was designed to produce misleading

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,890
false or ambiguous information parallel

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,290
to the relevant one practically we sort

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,899
of multiply the information available

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,360
and by multiplying it we sort of draw

00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:01,450
attention to all we are bombarded with

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,730
different information we are hiding in

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,640
the relevant information next to other

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,620
types of information and people are

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,720
confused when when they are searching it

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,470
but this technique however even though

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,929
is great in general does not work for AI

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,559
systems because in in the situation of

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:24,760
AI we need job and in the situation of a

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,679
deletion request we need to forget

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,450
something that initially we never have

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:34,780
thought it is necessary to forget so

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:37,330
it's problematic to apply your to apply

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,040
this tactic group to such cases now

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,920
let's see what happens if we try to

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,320
delete something from from an AI system

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,120
one research study conducted in this

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,820
field reached the conclusion that if we

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,519
delete one element from

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,440
from inside from inside AI it does not

00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,120
have a large scale effect on the quality

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,950
of the machine though this research was

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:03,309
conducted or nom-nom was not conducted

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,169
in a situation when we actually delete

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,659
something in particular they practically

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:10,389
just deleted randomly a certain piece of

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,669
information another from another

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,100
research is related to making the data

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,399
less sensitive which would mean that it

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,990
will not be so relevant for for the GDP

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:22,179
our legislation for the data protection

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,100
legislation and however in this

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,559
situation if we make the data less

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,110
sensitive the GDP are for example states

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:36,190
that we however need consent from from

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:38,470
the people ah and another another

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,129
solution might be functional encryption

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,379
algorithms which does not work on big

00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:46,629
data we have certain ization and data

00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:50,139
animation which are like other two

00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:52,720
aspects that that were not so that don't

00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:58,330
that were proven not to be working in

00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:01,149
this some in this case and here we can

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,620
see some possible approaches to respect

00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,629
the right to be forgotten in the AI

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,370
environment and the first most effective

00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:08,169
one is data minimization which is quite

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,850
interesting because this means that

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,399
governments and companies should not

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,100
collect information that the information

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,679
that is not needed for performing a

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,679
certain action which was consensually

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,019
and accepted by by the person by the

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,820
data subject then we can have an

00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:28,179
interdisciplinary research which is

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:32,259
dedicated specifically to applying

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:34,059
deletion requests in AI systems and also

00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:36,159
future laws should address this

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,769
problematic because the GD P R does not

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,480
talk specifically about the AI so we

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,350
don't know exactly how we should apply

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,259
it legally and regarding the GD P R in

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,720
general we can like use it because it is

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,730
our opportunity as Europeans to make it

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,980
a state of the art in order for other

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,649
continents and for other countries that

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,279
do not benefit from from from it up in

00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:02,380
order to protect our privacy so in order

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,920
to to claim respecting

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,410
privacy and also we can we can start

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,480
using secure alternatives to mainstream

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,040
mom to mainstream products and I

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,530
selected here a few that I personally

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,930
used you can see here Mastodon which is

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,400
a decentralized social network we can

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,620
see matrix which is an encrypted

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,300
end-to-end chat and we also see creep

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,340
pad which is a zero knowledge

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:29,770
collaborative editor and these are my

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,900
contact details feel free to contact me

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,140
up and discuss further about this topic

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,120
and if you have any questions I'm

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:42,670
available to answer them thank you

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,670
