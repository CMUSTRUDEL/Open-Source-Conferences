Title: OW2con'18 On GDPR compliance, the Right to be forgotten and Artificial Intelligence
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	The right to be forgotten took the spotlight among privacy rights especially after the ruling C-131/12 Google v. Gonzales from the European Court of Justice in 2012, stating that as a data controller Google needs to comply to requests on deletion from data subjects. The effect was that hundreds of thousands demanded erasure from the search index. What was Google's response to those requests and how do tech companies prepare to address the new GDPR - where respecting the right to be forgotten is a demand for compliance? What does the law intend to say when it speaks about deletion and what are the consequences of not complying? Also, why AI is such a particular subject in this discussion and what ways were tried until now in the research world to ensure protection of data under the right to be forgotten? Considering the nature of machine learning systems, is it possible to proverbially make an AI system forget? This presentation will propose potential answers to these questions; also, it will address the topic of how humans forget and why ultimately this is as relevant as the ways machines do.
