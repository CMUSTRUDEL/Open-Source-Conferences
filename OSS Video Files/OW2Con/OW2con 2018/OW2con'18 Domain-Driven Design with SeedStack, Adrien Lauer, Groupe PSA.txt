Title: OW2con'18 Domain-Driven Design with SeedStack, Adrien Lauer, Groupe PSA
Publication date: 2018-06-13

Description: 
	Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has always been a major part of SeedStack but the latest version cranks it up to 11! This talk is about discovering the power behind DDD and how it can be effectively put to practice with SeedStack. 

In a demonstration, we will see how a simple business model can be implemented. Then we will progressively enrich it to a full-fledged micro-service, using features such as dependency injection, technology-agnostic data access or hypermedia-enabled REST APIs. Along the way, we will take advantage of the SeedStack ecosystem to integrate other technologies like Swagger, MongoDb, JPA or embedded servers.

Finally a quick wrap-up will describe how software projects at "Groupe PSA" are leveraging SeedStack to build sophisticated applications and micro-services, in an hybrid cloud environment.
