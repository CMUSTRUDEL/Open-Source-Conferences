00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,620
so this is now we're getting bottom-up

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,330
this is a bit about technology but we're

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,730
running late so I will keep this short

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,520
so talk a bit about the language our

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,320
Lang and which is open source of course

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:26,099
and some issues around that so I just

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,230
want to point this out right yes it was

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,380
developed by Ericsson which is a telecom

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,239
company but no it's not a telecom

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,890
language and this is actually quite

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,920
important then the whole system itself

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,350
is not a telecom system directly okay so

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,250
I'll be very quick here but what we were

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,800
trying to do originally was look at

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,379
designing software for building telecom

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,440
type applications that's what we're out

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,969
to do we were lab doing this getting

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,670
back to what Simon said yes we were

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,739
using BSD 4.0 to start off with it so we

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,579
were on that we were actually Erickson's

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,869
first UNIX system at all but what we

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,640
found out was that what we needed to

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,520
solve the problem we need to solve was

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,260
actually not telecoms oriented all the

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,939
telecom stuff had been done we didn't

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,280
need to control the switch because

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,740
someone written that software so you had

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,390
to do a problem something like this we

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,820
had a lot of concurrency going on in the

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,720
system we had timing constraints Cisco

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,070
could never block we needed distribution

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,380
continuous operation and maintenance and

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,670
fault tolerance in the system and if you

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,619
look at there there's nothing about

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,880
telecoms in this this is actually quite

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,590
important for later on as well - so yeah

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,119
this is just developing we were out to

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,729
solve the problem this is what this is

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,619
what our goal was we're now to develop a

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,780
specific type of language or specific

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,399
type of system we were trying to solve

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,149
the problem everything in the language

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,610
and the system was around this well

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,070
first principle we need a lightweight

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,640
massive concurrency asynchronous

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,439
communication process isolation so when

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,180
things crash they wouldn't take down the

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,340
rest of the system for example all these

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,709
type of things we need support for error

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,560
handling and continuous evolution of the

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,360
system we felt concurrency and

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,040
handling things like this was so

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
important you don't put the monitor

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,480
librarian on top you bake it into the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,690
system we wanted high-level language we

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,340
wanted simplicity the basic system and

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,080
the basic ideas and the bottom of the

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,640
system should be simple if you get the

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,590
simplicity right that means you can

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,569
build any level of complexity on top of

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,030
it but it's all understandable right and

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,489
also we found we provide tools not

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,750
solutions and we typically found that

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,340
the hard way because we've tried to

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,440
provide solutions they usually didn't

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,319
work because much better providing tools

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,720
and letting letting the users use it so

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,150
yeah and I just want to say all this

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,709
went into the Erlang language it's a

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,450
simple functional language it's like

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,250
that the concurrency primitives in there

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,489
is asynchronous communication the error

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,319
handling etc all this is in the language

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,700
it also went downwards into the

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
implementation of the virtual machine

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,860
which contains support for all these

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,900
things in the virtual machine so the

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,700
function language properties lightweight

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,650
massive concurrency and we are truly

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,510
talking massive concurrency here we're

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,910
talking things like that like millions

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,709
of processors on one machine running and

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,440
there are there are serious systems that

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:29,130
do this the communication the error

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,500
handling you have systems which just the

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,060
system as a whole never crashes things

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,549
might go wrong and it in crash but the

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,650
system does not the continuous evolution

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,140
there's support for it their support for

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,850
the soft real timeless it is practically

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,799
impossible to get them to block the a

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,510
line system you can if you really put

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,569
effort into it but why default it just

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:53,880
does not block there is a lot of support

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,620
for powerful introspection tools as well

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,139
this is nothing really surprising but

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,120
it's it's all there and this is what we

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,489
leak we call the Allen ecosystem it

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,720
builds on top of this so at the base you

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,819
have the beam which is the Erlang

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,290
virtual machine you have our line the

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,540
language and you have something called

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,030
OTP which stands for open telecom

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,459
platform but there's no telecoms in it

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,900
there either on top of that you can have

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,729
a number of languages and systems

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,659
running which we call partly a line okay

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,159
we recall the Allen ecosystem and if

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,539
they if you do they're done correctly

00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,340
they can all interact with each other

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,430
and talk with each other and the benefit

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,410
you get

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,470
more than any basis to these systems

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,910
running on it so this is this is what we

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,440
call the Allen ecosystem and the

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,210
development for it and the important

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,470
thing here is that our line and the

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:45,250
language here nothing contains anything

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,509
which is specific to telecoms this was

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,800
done in inside Ericsson and this was a

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,199
proprietary product inside Eric's and

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
which Arabs were using in some places in

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,919
their systems

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,800
however we went open-source and the 20

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,160
20 years again is important here because

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,630
we went open-source in 1998 so that's

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,120
something Simon missed in his list of

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,139
important points from 1998 that our line

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:18,389
was open source in 1998 forever

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:22,630
this took a lot of effort to do this

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:24,400
this was a problem because Ericsson this

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,970
did not come naturally to Ericsson for a

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,580
number of reasons they were not they're

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,680
not a software company so what do I mean

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,659
by this is yes they produce an awful lot

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,110
of software and basically every product

00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,340
they have contains software so there in

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,289
that sense then producing a lot of

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,599
software but they're not selling

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,370
software they're selling products which

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,430
use software inside so their idea of

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,120
handling software just didn't didn't

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,120
happen to them right

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,340
this meant it difficult to get them to

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,509
think about software as something

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,729
separate from the products they were

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:04,509
doing as a base for maybe doing open

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:06,280
source in the future with it that's also

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,320
why was important for example that it

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,479
didn't get that the system itself did

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,500
not contain any telecoms for because

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,120
then that would never would have been

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,560
outside this took a lot of work and the

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,539
person who was mainly behind this was

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,580
woman called Jane wall heard she was

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:24,009
working on sales and marketing of our

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,400
line internally inside Ericsson and she

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,830
said she felt that the this would very

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,490
suit this system this software our

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,909
designs the OTP system will be very

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,650
suitable for making open-source and she

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,999
put a lot of effort into convincing

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,729
management that this was

00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:45,319
the viable open-source software it will

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:48,589
not harm Ericsson if it became

00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,179
open-source and would be big support to

00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,189
them because we get feedback from the

00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:55,509
system and help and things like this for

00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:58,009
as well - it was also a legal problem

00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:00,079
because they had to convince and the

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,519
legal department here that if they made

00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,789
this open-source they need the right

00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,439
type of Licensing for so wouldn't cost

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,360
Ericsson if someone used it in a crashed

00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,999
or something like this for and all these

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,159
things that she put a lot of effort into

00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:19,189
convincing that this worked and in 1998

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,899
our line became open-source and I think

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,229
it was Erickson's first open-source

00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:27,739
software they still use internally in

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:30,349
products and now it has spread quite a

00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:32,089
lot it's an infrastructure system you'll

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,669
find a lot of infrastructure for our

00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,799
systems are written you know you don't

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,209
see it like all good infrastructure you

00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:43,159
don't see the infrastructure it's just

00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:46,429
there and this works for what the

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,499
Cathedral versus bizarre bazaar here

00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:55,879
mean what I meant here was that just

00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:58,579
that how the open-source and maintained

00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,379
is the system we interact with the users

00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:04,879
who use it and who want to extend it

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:08,739
this becomes quite difficult in some

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,999
ways because it is very much

00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:12,169
infrastructure and you have to be very

00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,969
careful when you're working with

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,529
infrastructure because any changes you

00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,929
make will affect an awful lot of people

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,539
and a lot of the people a lot of the

00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:23,689
groups or systems or products that you

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:25,759
will affect you don't know about which

00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,889
means they at the at the base level the

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,329
airline system they very much like to

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:34,309
keep control of what goes into the

00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:35,839
system they are very restrictive they

00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,699
have a lot of requirements for backward

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,289
compatibility and things like this for

00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:41,240
just to make sure that if you're using

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,600
this system you can depend on it in the

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,850
future as well

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,680
however on top of that on top of the

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,120
a-line system the airline base of course

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,220
there are a lot of applications written

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,259
which are open-source you have other

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,400
languages for example on the pan talk

00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,770
about here busy

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,260
common language becoming more common

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,330
alcohol alexia which is also open source

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,880
of course and they have a different set

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,470
of requirements they're both playing at

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,300
the language application level where

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,710
they have to be careful but a lot of

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,990
package is written on top which don't

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,610
have to worry about this

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,830
so whether whether we're Cathedral

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,180
whether we're bazaar depends very much

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:22,730
where you look in what you're doing for

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:25,310
and yeah it's worked the open source has

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,160
worked it's now Apache 2.0 license work

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,360
it was a slightly hacked mozilla license

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,610
from the beginning but it's now it's

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,890
open for and i think the result of it

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,230
has been good not just the fact that is

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,410
now available in the public but the

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,570
feedback from the system has worked in

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,330
that they've received help from from

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,820
users from companies using it would come

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,410
back with our suggestions and ideas for

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,190
code for improving the system as well so

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,930
this has worked though it's not free not

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,580
free in the sense that it is a little

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,050
quite a lot of extra work and that's

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,240
basically all i want to see here say

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,800
here sorry there's an hour long meet up

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,650
after lunch so if you want to hear more

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,940
about our line please come along to that

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:16,160
aren't exactly who's talking there but

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,930
we'll find out yeah I think that's about

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,270
it and I didn't take you a long time

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,640
okay which is quite remarkable for me

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:27,419
okay thank you

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,419
