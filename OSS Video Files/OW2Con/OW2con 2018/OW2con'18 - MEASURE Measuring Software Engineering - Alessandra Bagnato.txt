Description: 
	The goal of the project is to increase the quality and efficiency, and lower the costs and time-to-market of software engineering in Europe. To reach this ambitious goal, the project will iteratively and incrementally:
1) Define better metrics and develop methods and tools for automated, precise, and unbiased measurement of software engineering activities and artefacts.
2) Develop methods and tools for analysing the big data produced by the continuous measurement to enable continuous improvement of performance.
3) Validate the developed metrics and measurement tools by integrating them into software development environments and processes of the industrial partners, and iteratively improve them based on the feedback gathered from the industry.
4) Validate the developed analysis tools by analysing the data gathered from the industrial partners and measuring the impact of the improvements suggested by the analysis tools. A practical example of a measurement-based suggestion could be pointing out an area of source code not covered by automated test suite and generating new targeted test automation scripts based on manual test cases recorded during continuous measurement.
5) Support management decision-making by visualizing the results of continuous measurement at targeted level of abstraction, i.e., providing different visualization or even completely different metrics for developers and managers.

In addition to the competitive advantage gained with the better quality and lower costs of software development in general, the project consortium includes commercial tool vendors and open source tool developers aiming to the new market segment of advanced analytics. Advanced analytics is the fastest-growing segment of the business intelligence (BI) and analytics software market was over $1 billion already in 2013 .
