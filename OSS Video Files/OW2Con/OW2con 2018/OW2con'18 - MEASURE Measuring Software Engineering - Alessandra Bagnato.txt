Title: OW2con'18 - MEASURE Measuring Software Engineering - Alessandra Bagnato
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	The goal of the project is to increase the quality and efficiency, and lower the costs and time-to-market of software engineering in Europe. To reach this ambitious goal, the project will iteratively and incrementally:
1) Define better metrics and develop methods and tools for automated, precise, and unbiased measurement of software engineering activities and artefacts.
2) Develop methods and tools for analysing the big data produced by the continuous measurement to enable continuous improvement of performance.
3) Validate the developed metrics and measurement tools by integrating them into software development environments and processes of the industrial partners, and iteratively improve them based on the feedback gathered from the industry.
4) Validate the developed analysis tools by analysing the data gathered from the industrial partners and measuring the impact of the improvements suggested by the analysis tools. A practical example of a measurement-based suggestion could be pointing out an area of source code not covered by automated test suite and generating new targeted test automation scripts based on manual test cases recorded during continuous measurement.
5) Support management decision-making by visualizing the results of continuous measurement at targeted level of abstraction, i.e., providing different visualization or even completely different metrics for developers and managers.

In addition to the competitive advantage gained with the better quality and lower costs of software development in general, the project consortium includes commercial tool vendors and open source tool developers aiming to the new market segment of advanced analytics. Advanced analytics is the fastest-growing segment of the business intelligence (BI) and analytics software market was over $1 billion already in 2013 .

[Music]

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,429
so good afternoon I am Alessandra Bonnie

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,490
Otto from soft team research scientists

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,680
of team and I would like to introduce to

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,340
you one of the project that I coordinate

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,519
the major idea tree project actually

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:29,519
this project is really close to the

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:32,610
title of this here o w2 so our values

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,739
and the value that we can get from this

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,600
value so we are measuring software

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,840
engineering so we have a lot of values

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,950
and we do that since the first December

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,530
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,879
now the projects is in this last year

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,820
and the project consists of different

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,920
natural consortiums each one of them has

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,379
its own natural rules for funding and

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,840
for working but they managed to work all

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,219
together we had the Turkish consortium

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,530
joining the team just in February and

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,960
collaborating with Romanian team and the

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,409
endurance team as the france france

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,119
group so what we want to do i want we

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,790
plan is to increase of course the

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,799
efficiency and the quality of the cost

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,530
and time to market of software

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,450
engineering and then we do that trying

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,689
to implement a comprehensive set of tool

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,180
that could help in that and to provide

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,590
advanced and analytics to do that so

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,229
this is a really a journey between

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,390
values and value and we provide a

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,119
platform and methods and tools to do

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,950
that and with all the values that we

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,200
managed to collect we are able to

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,840
provide some recommendation we also

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,560
define some new matrix to help indies in

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,720
this effort to be aware of the new in

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,720
dooster needs here in the Odie's days

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,970
and we of course evaluate data on

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,460
different case studies so this is the

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,399
solution that we have in here so we have

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,390
the first part that you see so we can

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,579
develop we can do the deploy and the

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,879
configuration and the collector in this

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,550
part we have our values and in the

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,770
second part the store the visualize the

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,440
combined in the

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:19,010
analytics we give the value to the to

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,330
the customer and to the users of this

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:27,020
platform so in here you see how we have

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,250
our values so we start from the

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,830
development part so we start by

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,380
standardizing with the object management

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,930
group structured metric metamodel our

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,030
matrix then we have a development

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,330
environment of new matrix based on the

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,030
model a modeling tool and then we have

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,310
deploy of these matrix as a executable

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,680
jar file on the platform

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,920
we start the collector we can configure

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,290
this matrix based details of each

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,870
particular matrix situation you will see

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,150
an example where we have data collected

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,740
from us when in this case we of course

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,410
configure the matrix with the name of

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,100
the server and the virus password we

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:13,790
collect the data then we store the data

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,520
using state-of-the-art technology like

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,370
we use elasticsearch we visualize the

00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,350
data in this case we use cabana and

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,270
we are able to combine the various

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,340
matrix that we have and of course to

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,430
analyze them and with different analysis

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,290
tools so in series in here you see all

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,750
the tools I will not go through through

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,120
all of them but actually we start with

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,070
the configuration tool that is the

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,580
standard base structured metric

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,700
metamodel med modeling tool based on the

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,730
model tool soft in my company is

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,550
developing the normal modeling tool

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,860
model then we have various different

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,480
measurement tool to comply with

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,850
different and advances matrix that are

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,630
not ready on the market so for example

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:06,580
we provide any energy monitoring matrix

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:10,040
we provide the model analysis matrix and

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,530
network matrix that are really new

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,300
otherwise we can integrate ourself OB

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,090
state-of-the-art tool like sonar tube

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,739
all with the same platform then we can

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,560
go with the visualization in the

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,740
platform that is done with cabana and

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,530
analysis tool that are using different

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,840
technique

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,170
some of them also machine learning and

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,540
I'm clustering technique so in here I'm

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,960
going fast to the challenges and you

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,670
will have all the link if you want to

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,580
have more details on the work everything

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,850
is of course open source and you can

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,040
assess it from different repository for

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,140
example for what regard the structural

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,090
metric metamodel the specification is

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,420
available at the object management group

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,800
website and in here you have the formal

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,010
description of matrix that we have

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,800
follow it we have announced that with

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,350
tooling to develop this measure so in

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,930
this case we have announced the model

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,350
you modeling tool we have a profile to

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,340
be able to design this kind of metric

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,740
and be able to develop this metric and

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,760
to package them because our innovative

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,430
it the idea is actually to be able to

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,410
then deploy the matrix developed we also

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,840
supported the development with a library

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,990
so there is a facility that can be used

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,390
to better develop matrix everything is

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,940
in github open source and well

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,980
documented by wiki pages so if you are

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,140
interested to join our little

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,919
open-source group there you are very

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,890
welcome and in here you are the deploy

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,050
that is actually what makes the platform

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,020
also interesting because actually once

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,680
the metric has been created its packaged

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,350
in a in a in a specified way that we are

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,950
using in a jar file and that can be

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:05,130
immediately included in the platform and

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,419
then we wanted to cover all the phases

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,720
of the software development lifecycle

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:12,660
and you can see in here now I've written

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,330
in 153 they may be more our review is

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,479
coming soon so we are developing more

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,640
and more matrix to better show the

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,630
potential but you have all the catalog

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:28,470
available and documented on on our

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,870
github and the link are all there then

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,130
we can as I said customize the matrix so

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,740
in case we have matrix that were a

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,700
particular data so particular servers

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,690
particular logging embosser you can

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,370
them and then you can we can start with

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,050
the collecting we have a scheduling

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,290
service to collect all the measures that

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,120
we have and in here you see that for

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,760
this collect we have different

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,020
measurement tool that can be cold that

00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:00,020
can be used depending on the customer of

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,180
the end-user situation so for example in

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,090
here we have the model measurement tool

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,350
that is the one that was development by

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,750
soft team with the help of the

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,230
University of Austin and the University

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,800
of York the tool is able to monitor the

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:18,740
status of models so of design models in

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,420
this case specific women model models so

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,030
it can give matrix about the number of

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,610
classes the number of interfaces the

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,150
number of classes per components and

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,160
many things like that and those metric

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,290
are not existing in the market so we can

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,700
integrate them with other code metrics

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:40,700
like the one used in sonar cube and well

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,220
we can execute them on client side we

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,970
can collect and calculate the metric and

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,140
store them in elasticsearch analysis

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,670
search database so we use

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,100
state-of-the-art things not to develop

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,770
everything from scratch we show them as

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,300
I said visualizing them in Cabana to be

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,560
able to have a customizable

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,720
visualization and we provide a dashboard

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,630
to the customer and to the end user in

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,180
this case the the dashboard are

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,710
customizable so with kiba now we can

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,230
just select the type of graphics that

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,860
can be can be put in the dashboard and

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:18,230
we have a way to provide to each kind of

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,570
user the proper dashboard that Suites to

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,180
the needs so maybe a project manager

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,920
will have a type of dashboard follow me

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,080
for example what happens on the a7

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,620
repository on the github what are the

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,380
commits what is going on for his team

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,530
but maybe software developer will have

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,360
more metric on this on the code side so

00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,370
maybe we'll have the Sun RQ matrix and

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,250
the designer may have more metrics

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,960
related to the quality of the models and

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,760
the leader of the technical team will

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,800
that might be all of them and we like

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,360
the possibility to cross them to have

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,089
insight

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,529
happen weave with the values with the

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,750
various phases of the software

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,300
development life cycle in this case is

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,160
what we do in here combined we cross

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,529
measure from different tools and

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,470
software development phases so we are

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:09,410
able for example if there is a server

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,510
that has a peak for energy consumption

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,130
we can maybe discover that there has

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,560
been an attack because we have also

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,510
security matrix that has been triggered

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:23,000
and how we actually do that is we have a

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,459
customized visualization so we are able

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,490
to do that and we have potential

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,279
analysis tool that can be applied so for

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,810
example we have in here a structure we

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,470
can integrate the various external

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,000
analysis tool in the same platform and

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,040
the tool will register to the platform

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,610
we will have a notification system and

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,250
we'll follow them the guideline to be in

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:51,230
the platform at this very moment we have

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:54,220
these these quality quality analysis

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,170
analysis tool we are able to integrate

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,199
matrix adjuster tool that is able to

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,370
suggest matrix for for the platform so

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:06,500
if we have too many matrix and that is a

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,279
much advanced at study that is still

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,070
under under under work to be able to do

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,190
with machine learning calculation to

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,649
determine matters that may be avoided to

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,019
a blast consumption and we have other

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,180
tools to a matter coloration to do

00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,910
clustering and quality analysis tool let

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,490
us the possibility to have a threshold

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,760
fixed set for the platform so in here

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,160
you see all that I've shown before so

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,940
basically all all the solution to have

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,100
the values and the value for our for our

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:45,440
customers and user the tools are there

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,839
you can follow and github repository of

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,430
measure but I put the link before to

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,360
download some of them and to try them

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,060
out and so what happens next we had a

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,040
first interim evaluation of the platform

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,500
that was successful and now we will

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,640
apply at the real case studies so the

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,550
first one is the the softie model you

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,090
development lifecycle then we have case

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,980
study from the CNS large novel software

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,930
development group so a completely

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,420
different software development lifecycle

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,190
approach and then we have three case

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,010
study from the Turkish consortium that

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,840
deal with telecom problem and we have a

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,300
case studies from BitDefender in

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,980
development project from Turkey and

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,750
related to security as you know

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,030
BitDefender is very known from their

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,710
achievement in security in here you see

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,960
some of the matrix that we are starting

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,960
to collect for model modeling tool so

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,330
they are many own development we have

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,670
some sonarqube you can see in here and

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,740
the you have somewhat from the models so

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,000
number of methods map road package

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,680
requirement and as a last slide if you

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,200
want to see and you have occasion to

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,150
come tune on the next week on Friday we

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,700
have a kind of exhibition where we show

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,340
all the tools and everything that has

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,150
been that has been done in the project

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,700
on the technical side and here are my

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,390
details and the nice team and if you

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,390
