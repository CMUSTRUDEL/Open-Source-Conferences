Title: OW2con'18 - Expanding the business knowledge with Knowage advanced analytics
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: OW2con 2018
Description: 
	In the past, companies could mainly access to their own structured and certified data, but nowadays they can extract valuable information also from external sources (Facebook, TripAdvisor, Twitter, LinkedIn, …). Connecting the heterogeneous data (comments, reviews, textual descriptions,…) coming from these sources to those already owned it’s essential to understand the effectiveness of the company business. Knowage suite provides its users traditional and advanced tools to analyse heterogeneous data: the speech will present the latest news of the suite on the emerging analytics techniques, such as full text search, machine learning, predictive analyses and more.

hi everybody thank you for inviting us

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,500
here this is gonna be very general and

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,269
not so specific and technical I am Paula

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,870
Ranieri I'm the business developer at no

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,570
age and I want to let you understand or

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,560
let you know what we think about data

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,600
driven economy and open source together

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,970
the first step is to talk you something

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,849
about that something that you already

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,700
know for sure in these last 20 years we

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,610
experienced a lot of great acceleration

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,489
of the innovation due to the digital

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,629
world new technologies new disruptive

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,489
business models new discoveries like

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:46,230
expose on or whatever and everything

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,360
falls down into the digital

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,140
transformation era let me say it's a

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,230
sort of marketing name but it helped us

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,469
a lot as a community because now every

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,410
company knows that they have to embrace

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,329
digital not just like a small business

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,119
unit with small budgets but as a

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,189
pervasive thing and while you are doing

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,930
this you have to be data-driven in my

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,380
opinion and I think also that you have

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,659
to consider also open source for some

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,549
reason one is these on the excesses you

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,970
can see the time and on the y-axis you

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,610
can see the speed of change and we all

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,210
know that new technologies and new

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,689
innovations changes exponentially while

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,060
your organization will change

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,280
logarithmically and that's a very tricky

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,770
for every manager because once you have

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,530
to understand whether if it is the case

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,229
or not to implement a new technology or

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,180
a new innovation you are sure that you

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,970
are going to do this in a very slow way

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,720
so you have to be sure that this is the

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:55,350
right chose so you have you can't do

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,899
these options you can't choose this by

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,790
using your gut you have to do this based

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,110
on data I think and that's another

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,030
example if you have the technology

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,000
number one in red and technology number

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,459
two in violet that we see on the y-axis

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,730
you have performance or competitive

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,770
advantage if you are in the a stat but

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,810
obviously you

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,850
and remain to the first technology

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,670
because it's gonna give you the

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,490
competitive advantage for a while and in

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,960
the d step you it's stupid to remain to

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,600
the first one you have to skip forward

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,820
if you want to continue to be on the

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,860
verge of innovation but normally you are

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,050
in the dilemma zone and in the dilemma

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,050
zone again you have to use data but it's

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,420
really really tricky here I present you

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,600
one of my favorite data visualization

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,250
man Hans Rosling maybe somebody already

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,870
knows him it's the founder of a

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,000
Gapminder so open source project he died

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,560
two years ago unfortunately but I still

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,710
love him he he was a professor of global

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,470
health and this is a test that he did

00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,630
many many times to his students what I

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,480
asked what I'm going to ask you is to

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,480
try to select try to choose which of

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,750
these couples of countries have the

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,330
higher children mortality rate so Sri

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,000
Lanka or turkey Poland or South Korea

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:21,260
and in many cases you find yourself

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,730
wrong the orange dots are the right

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:29,720
answers and normally people are right

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:32,510
1.28 time on five and that's because of

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,600
preconceptions because it comes out it

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,970
comes out that doing a test at the zoo

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,740
chimpanzees are better than people so

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,840
it's probably because they don't have

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,540
preconceptions and this is a funny way

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,240
to tell you that when you use data when

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,940
you go and and try to really be

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,520
data-driven with your company you never

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,080
have to use preconceptions because

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,660
statistics and numbers always can tell

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,270
you what you want and this is true also

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,420
for the open source if you try to answer

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,850
to this question too many many many

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,620
times you will select one percentage

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,110
that is less than 80 percent but we

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,610
already know here here it's easy for me

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,440
because we already are involved in the

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,840
open source but normally when I do this

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,200
test many people say 20 or 30 percent

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,160
instead almost every company now is

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,970
running something on open source almost

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,510
every advisory agency considered the

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,210
open saw

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,820
as one of the key factor if a company

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,410
really wants to be involved in the

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,150
digital transformation era in the right

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,370
way and that's true also for the

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,520
data-driven and we saw a lot of great

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,920
examples these days about private

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,310
companies that embrace the open source

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,810
and free software word I I put here to

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,210
tell all that we all know that some

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,400
years ago they released their patent to

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,920
the open source we know that few days

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,150
ago Microsoft bought a key tab I don't

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,450
know where this will lead us but ok it's

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,460
ok they embrace this and another thing

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,290
that I want to show you is that open

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,450
source was already well spread around

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,360
the world but normally it was involved

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,210
in the discussions on Big Data mobile

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,820
cloud and whatever now is the time in

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,960
which the open source it's involved also

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,570
in the CFO discussion and as a matter

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,850
say say when one's open source became

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,810
involved in the in the financial world

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,420
the momentum is unstoppable at the same

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,390
and those are some examples of sentences

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:39,130
that you can you can hear from different

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:43,280
CEOs in the world and I try to make it

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,530
funny because I think that the open

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,530
source in data-driven now is leaving a

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,930
new hype that is very very similar in my

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,720
opinion to the high tea hype that Big

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,680
Data had a few years ago just like

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,570
teenage sex

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,180
everybody's claiming that is doing but

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,730
few people really have a clue on what is

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,010
going on and we are all those people so

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,590
the time for us is coming we have to

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,580
push for it and I totally agree with

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,560
this to cite myself I can say you that

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,690
noise is a great example of this because

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,320
we mix obviously data-driven and open

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:21,560
source we are a data visualization tool

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,630
coming to data analytics when it comes

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,700
to data analytics you have to show data

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,360
in a way that both people enjoy and

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,040
understand and if you can do it by

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,430
adding the value of open source I think

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,700
you're rockin so I'd really like us okay

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,590
but I still see people that is trying to

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,020
telling me that

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,090
open source is not for big projects at

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,400
all and we really don't think so and I

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,230
hope you also don't think so and I lift

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,630
the microphone to Alessandro that will

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,090
show you why we don't think so we don't

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,090
agree thanks Bob

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:03,260
so and I'm here to present a couple of

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:08,000
project where no age has been used with

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:13,760
success on top of whole open source

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,010
stack of technologies the context of

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,270
these projects are the same so it's

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:22,580
industry 4.0 so I'm sure you already

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,470
know what is industry foreign policy or

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,000
so to summarize is just is about Network

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:35,690
Internet of Things information that are

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,690
obtained and processed to to have a

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:43,730
better a better industry and to more

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:46,160
performance and the first use cases is a

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,650
code dive which means digital

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,170
visualization experience and it's a

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,770
project about both of the project are

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,280
about predictive maintenance with where

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,870
knowledge is being used on top of the

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,830
open source stack so all the

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,620
technologies that I'm going to show in

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,620
this two example of use case real-world

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,790
use case so we are we are talking with

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:16,610
the customers to see who can be who can

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,580
can can integrate this this kind of this

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,730
kind of platform that we in which we we

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,990
contribute with noise so the first one

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,970
dive is miss has been it's been

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,490
developed in collaboration with Kamau

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:37,430
which is a world-leading which is a

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:40,099
world leading robotics company and of

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:45,310
course engineering with the company that

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:50,990
develops actually no age so this is the

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:52,830
let's say overall architecture so we

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,830
have the plant architecture and

00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:00,630
on the Left we have the we call it odd

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:03,890
storage so it's matter of sensors and

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:07,730
wearable devices and all the things that

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,920
are involved in this industry point 4.0

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,850
context while most interesting for a

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,940
noise and for the predictive maintenance

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:21,630
in terms of application and software is

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:25,230
the cloud so data comes from the plant

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:29,640
architecture to the to the right part of

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,490
the of this architecture and our that

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,000
this data are then manipulate and

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,730
process it using noise and machine

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,710
learning techniques so we have this

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,170
presentation we have this presentation

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,270
layer were no edges on top of it and

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:50,850
disabled knowledge ease has been used to

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,070
to create prediction map predictive

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,830
model and to visualize the data in a

00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:01,940
easy way so this is the architecture

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:05,390
more in deep so the data comes from the

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,940
plant architecture and goes to a patch

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:12,150
patching knife I and which is the total

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:16,050
team project and the data after that

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:20,190
goes to the metallics from their data

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,520
are processed using apache spark with

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:28,070
the spark and mellow lib library and

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,560
then knowledge is able to use this data

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,750
through the Impala driver to guess the

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:41,670
data it to and and to visualize the data

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:46,100
at the end so which are the question

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,840
that this kind of platform can answer

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,820
mainly are to question what is happening

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,820
and what will happen so what is

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,740
happening so this is the answer is based

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:01,740
on real-time near real-time data and so

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,380
that the operator can get early warning

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,520
while the other is a predict cementing

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,310
so what will

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,010
and so with the predictive model we are

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:14,670
able to we have been able to defect the

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,990
detect error and the issue in the in the

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:21,090
industry so this is the the stack that

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,970
you can see so we have on the on the

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,610
bottom we have the raw data and on top

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,400
we have the big data cluster and the

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,950
anomaly detection predictive model is on

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,880
top of it of course and this has been

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,790
has been developed by no each team and

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:47,340
on top of that we use no H to visualize

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:50,220
the data that was so that was

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,650
particularly usually because the the

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,070
analytics behind is really complex of

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:58,890
course and the point to of data

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,530
visualization is to visualize and to

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:07,020
visualize and inside the data in a easy

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:09,090
way so this is another another

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,130
architecture is the same architecture of

00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,800
but mainly focused on the prediction

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,350
module so we have the pre-processing of

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,600
the data that goes in the predictive

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,450
model and after that in an anomaly

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,570
detection and from that we have the

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,210
simulation model that get the Cris data

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,120
set and after that no age

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:35,220
oh no age knowledge can have he is able

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,880
to able to use this data to create this

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,800
dashboard and to show the data 2d on to

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,960
the end-user

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:47,550
so these are these the kind of dashboard

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,980
that we develop it with this project I'm

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,890
just going to show some of them then

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,900
again the main point is that the

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:59,730
elaboration and processing behind is

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:03,660
really complex and the the benefit of

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,040
this kind of of no age and this kind of

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,380
application on top is that you can

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:13,740
easily see what's going on and you can

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:17,540
react easily instead of instead of using

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,540
other other kind of tool

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,940
okay so this is just some summary of the

00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,760
things that's already they already give

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,990
to you so dive is a modular suite so you

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,210
can decide that you can use the

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,810
analytics part instead of another one

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,330
and is using Python and it's close plah

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:45,120
plah smartphone and you can use it on

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,120
promise and the cloud is a cloud music

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:53,680
good the other the other use cases is

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:56,920
called data and he's actually has been

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,680
developed in in the context of an

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,880
another european project which is o

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,450
Oedipus and it uses its the same context

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,980
so predictive maintenance using no will

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:14,410
open through stack but this could you it

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:17,500
uses fiber open source stack so and the

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:20,650
directional between behind this died

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,810
project and this platform is to use all

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,410
the information that available out there

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,220
and how to manage these data analysis

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,830
and this complex complexity and so they

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,500
decided to use fiber technologies which

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,970
which are open source technologies and

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:43,029
knowledge so just few words about what

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:47,260
is fiber fiber is a European funded

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:50,220
project and that base all its philosophy

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:54,550
behind the context in the concept of

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,160
building context aware application so

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,950
each application is that is fiber

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,830
powered by power can benefit of this

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:07,750
context broker complete which gets data

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:10,300
and sent you data so for us this

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,790
collaboration has many others that we

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,279
have in the open source communities are

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:19,029
we was a win-win collaboration because

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,990
we we have been able to develop things

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:26,410
interesting things as the connector with

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,990
for Apache Solr and to get really fast

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,370
data and but also this is really a

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,570
benefit for the open source community

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,400
because your

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,770
is everything because we release

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,580
everything as open source so we are able

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:44,040
to actually build interesting things and

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:49,210
also to give it back to the community so

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:53,830
data is a platform again about analytics

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:55,450
and this is the let's say the the

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,870
architecture so on the bottom we have

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,670
the real world system let me say why on

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,640
the top we have the digital world system

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:08,380
so all the data comes from the bottom to

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,420
the to the top and is they are the they

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,080
are processed by the context broker and

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,900
then sent to the to to other other

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,630
companies like New Age quantum leap

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:25,750
which is a time series component and

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:29,980
wire cloud yeah this is just the work

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,600
the the the flow of the data so from the

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:37,270
IOT sensors they goes to the OPC agent

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,930
which is a contact sport user and then

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,990
goes to the contacts broker which is

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:47,470
like a company in publish/subscribe

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,720
fashion way and so you it gets data and

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,990
has some topics so you can subscribe and

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:58,630
you can get data so in this regard no

00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:01,990
age is a is a consumer of those data so

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:05,680
again these are the kind of dashboard

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:09,610
that you can build and on top of this

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:13,750
this this platform so from from again

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:16,390
the point is that behind this there are

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,730
a lot of predictive model and an

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,439
advanced analytics that are really

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,180
difficult to to inside but we do with

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,490
the data visualization everything is

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,480
more clear to the end-user

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:36,350
so that can react quickly than than

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:39,220
before so again

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:44,830
just some like of what is the

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:48,080
achievement of this kind of platform so

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,299
the needs of this kind of block is to

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
have and was to have an advanced

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,929
decision support for data analytics and

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,660
the problem that and that's why they

00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,570
choose to use the open an open source

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,190
stack is the vendor and the problem of

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:11,750
the vendor lock-in and of course the

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,210
Tyger Tyger cost at the beginning and of

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,179
course the open source comes in a pin

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,740
this so they have been able to to create

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:28,700
a complete solution that can be that can

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:32,690
be used by by anyone so this is again

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:36,520
summarized of the data platform so some

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:40,570
technology that is using and the the

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,570
from the from the bottom to the top

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,320
again open standards real industry

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,990
testing so that has been used has been

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,140
already using the context of how to

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:58,010
motive context so let me stress that

00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:02,840
these two projects our real-world

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:06,730
project that we are data is we are we

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:11,150
are pushing to to have it in the market

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:13,659
thank you and I know if our wants to say

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,659
