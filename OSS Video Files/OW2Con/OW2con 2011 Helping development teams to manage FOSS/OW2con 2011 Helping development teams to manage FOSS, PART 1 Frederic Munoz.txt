Description: 
	Speaker: Freddy Munoz, Antelink
Abstract: Today, most software development teams use free and open source software (FOSS) components, because it increases the speed and the quality of the development. Many open source components are the de facto standard of their category. However, FOSS has licensing restrictions, and corporate organizations usually maintain a list of allowed and forbidden licenses. But how do you enforce this policy? How can you make sure that ALL files in your source repository, either belong to you, or fit your licensing policy?
A first, preventive approach is to train and increase the awareness of the development team to these licensing issues. Depending on the size of the team, it may be costly but necessary.
However, this does not ensure that a single individual will not add a forbidden icon or library, and jeopardize the legal status of the whole release â€” or the company, since software is becoming more and more a critical asset. Another approach is to verify what is included in the source repository, and check whether it belongs to the open-source world.
This can be done on-the-fly, whenever a new file is added into the source repository. It can also be part of the release process, as a verification step before publishing the release. In both cases, there are some tools to automate the detection process.
This talk explores the various options regarding FOSS detection, how this process can be integrated in the "software factory", and how the results can be displayed in a usable and efficient way.

I'm criminals are from promoters of link

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,059
and the title patrols a little bit

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,940
different of what you find your God

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,150
i modified it a little bit but the

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:27,930
content is the same doesn't it titled

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:30,869
different so i think is a small start up

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,420
a reverse very jones started at paris

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,239
just in the heart just eric there is

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,210
something and we specialize in open

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,360
source management solutions let's say

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:47,850
we're a team of seven were very small

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:51,329
and tithing and we maintain and feed the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,000
world largest database knowledgebase of

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,539
open source components called add media

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,649
which posed more than one video project

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:06,150
500 million files right cetera so when

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:09,260
we are here today this track is about

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:14,400
the software quality about the polity

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:17,369
overall body to project and this is

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,040
about open source eyes about licenses

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,100
and why licenses influence the quality

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,790
of open source and the license

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,640
management inference that equality and

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:32,070
the wide open source is a very simple

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,350
and question that has a very simple

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,560
answer there are thousands of enterprise

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,409
radio controls from possible over the

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,649
last few years and there are thousands

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:52,170
of enterprises here to use that oven sir

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:56,340
and actually I furniture Rome is a

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,430
gardener study Oh perhaps an accenture

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,189
study eighty percent of those companies

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,969
that out there are actually integrated

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,490
open source in one way or another so

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,640
then you

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,489
can ask yourself the question okay why

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,540
caring about open source license

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:18,849
unlicensed issues in particular and why

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,390
is it hard to handle those license and

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:25,180
why is it hard to undo those licenses in

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,870
an industrial setting and to improper if

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,030
you don't slices they're open source and

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,870
there are many reasons why you care

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,849
about licenses why is it hard the first

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,640
one is that we need to respect the

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:42,150
outdoors wishes you need to respect what

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,799
the outer say when he wrote the code

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,000
when he produced that piece of code

00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:51,810
perhaps 13 sir organization and at some

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,690
point in time said I want it to be GPL

00:02:51,810 --> 00:03:00,760
lgpl bsd MIT whatever but the thing is

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:05,080
that he care enough to give his software

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:08,950
creation Eliza and as the user of that

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,640
software we should care about the second

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:16,540
problem of the second motivation is that

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,700
license data that is out there assuming

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,390
that we were eager to respect it out

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,150
front wishes snow pretty reliable you

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,950
can have several occurrences there the

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,280
first once license changes over time

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,440
here if you can read I'm sure if you can

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,880
read but here is the evolution of the

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,769
ante el aire product a very well-known

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,160
grammar parser and you see that in

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,799
version 2 and verse 13 the license are

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,019
completely different same people same

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,920
project different license there is

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:54,220
another example of of this real-world

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,829
problem and it is that lays license data

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,290
may be inconsistent for example here we

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:02,290
have a different excerpt from the deep

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,880
web mail website the first one says that

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,269
g webmail is under lgpl license ok

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,340
everything is fine if you go to their

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:15,430
source front page you find out there

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,840
have a mixture of opposite version 2 dot

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,320
0 and GPL

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,750
is ok it's kind of confusing but still

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,070
okay compatible and then when you go to

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:31,510
their about page it state that the whole

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,520
software package example is bundled 00

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,750
under the apache toodle-oo license and

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,419
if you go either down the code and you

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:45,800
will find no reference to any license at

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:48,350
all so this is the kind of complication

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,070
that we find when we are exploring

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,950
license and we want to care about

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:58,550
license data is inconsistent we want to

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,400
respect you out of wishes and finally if

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,600
we are not complying with license we can

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:09,320
have serious something indication we can

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,169
have materials IQ violation some

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,180
lawsuits devaluations on the injunctions

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:20,360
etc and to illustrate this this problem

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,360
that me tell you a story to story about

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,260
the views DC box a case study i don't

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:33,050
know if you know this looks is a small

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:35,800
linux toolchain is true provide some

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,620
support service in embedded devices and

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,349
one day if you see box was included

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,360
enough in a finger one day like any

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:49,039
other day one favor like any other

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,610
member and one day when she has a very

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:57,500
big manufacturer in the u.s. included

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,720
that framework into their HDTVs whether

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,910
they knew that it has all we had open

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,360
source or not we don't know but they did

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,320
it and they did a wishful so the guys

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,690
are busy box i noticed this this problem

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,330
i mean this situation they were never

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,289
notified about the use of disables so

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,900
they decided to feel lawsuit against

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:24,740
westinghouse also day they went all the

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,169
way and the lawyer went to the court and

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,129
they start fighting for the

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:36,770
on Vice this happened on the number

00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:39,289
fourteens 2009 and finally there was a

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,249
settlement a judge decided novice to

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:48,020
third as westinghouse was guilty of pipe

00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:50,629
evaluation and it assesses damages to

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,240
the district's project without a hundred

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,419
fifty thousand dollars american dollars

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,810
about that's not the real loss they're

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:04,099
the real loss is the inventory do they

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,930
have produced dozens of hdtvs and they

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:10,879
lost the Prophet the lakefill make out

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:14,990
of those HD TVs and the curt pronounce

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:17,930
an injunction so and they forbid within

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,349
how to sell those TV sets so they were

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,969
given to charity so millions of dollars

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:29,120
were lost millions of material loss

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:33,349
we're lost due to a small piece of

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,000
software in psychosis in tvs i hope this

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,000
