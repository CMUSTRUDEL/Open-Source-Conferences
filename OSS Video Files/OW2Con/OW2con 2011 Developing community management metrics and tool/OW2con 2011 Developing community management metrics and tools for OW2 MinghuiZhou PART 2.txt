Abstract: Processes that limit the size or potential of our community limit our products. Conversely, making it easier for people to cooperate, collaborate, experiment and play enhances the community's capacity.
We set out to improve contributor's productivity and product quality, and to improve the general understanding of issue-tracking practices. We develop community management metrics to measure contributors, projects, and their interaction, such as technical climate, project relative sociality,and their influences for newcomers. We introduce a visualization tool to reverse-engineer and improve issue-tracking practices. Using GNOME project data we demonstrate how our tool can be used to discover the evolution of issue tracking practices
