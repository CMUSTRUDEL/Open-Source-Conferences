Playlist: OW2con 2011 Developing community management metrics and tool
Description: 
	Speaker: Minghui Zhou, Pekin University
Abstract: Processes that limit the size or potential of our community limit our products. Conversely, making it easier for people to cooperate, collaborate, experiment and play enhances the community's capacity.
We set out to improve contributor's productivity and product quality, and to improve the general understanding of issue-tracking practices. We develop community management metrics to measure contributors, projects, and their interaction, such as technical climate, project relative sociality,and their influences for newcomers. We introduce a visualization tool to reverse-engineer and improve issue-tracking practices. Using GNOME project data we demonstrate how our tool can be used to discover the evolution of issue tracking practices

	00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,849
the topic I'm trying to give is to

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,160
develop community magic matrix and the

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:20,390
truth for open source software why

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,670
that's important first resonant ate

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:28,769
everything is the existence for example

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:33,059
allow me to Israeli system all projects

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:37,200
in all damages are combined together to

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,800
be a existence Jonas is the existent

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,110
because it has a lot of sub-projects the

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:56,480
for the question is how to build a

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:56,480
health ecosystem besides for the 60s

00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:07,830
they contributor experience facing more

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,640
as we could see this vengeance comes

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,390
from mozilla metric community they are

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,790
trying to build a community management

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,180
mattress for mozilla according to dream

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,240
the process of course are very important

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:29,430
the question is how to improve the

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:34,020
process we are you engaging for example

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:40,729
this is a key contributor Ron Mozilla

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:45,270
wrote in his blog he said I quit

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:48,630
Rockefeller because I the community

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,259
lacks the interest to improve the

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,630
process and where all our sometimes the

00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:02,369
process is the project all in the

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:05,430
communities oh then if this is a evil we

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,879
face so many questions for open-source

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,200
development then how how could we

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,340
address

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,230
questions the answer here is to use data

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:23,750
to enable better ecosystem better user

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,870
experiences or better process and

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:31,050
practices the basic idea is to

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,800
understand the past and the predicted

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,950
the future based on the data we have I

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,690
am going to talk about two pieces of

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,630
work we have been working on one is a

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,840
tool to crystallize the evolution of

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,750
issues with ruching practice based on

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,590
issue tracking data we all give some

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,190
examples they have done on Chrome and

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,450
Mozilla second I'll just introduce a

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:07,799
little later content about a cloud for

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,989
open source software practices based on

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,709
issue tracking data watching had rotator

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:18,889
antic email list who all kinds of we've

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:23,310
measured on websites now let's get to

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:31,290
practice evolution is flooring they call

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:34,889
it pe2 okay what is e to e to beat the

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,549
odds the history based on issue training

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:43,739
data that means the import of this tool

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:45,780
is filtered issue tracking data because

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,639
asia training system keeps track of

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,299
report based on the data we try to

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:58,109
answer questions related to the practice

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,170
evolution for example does the

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:06,799
environment change environment includes

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:11,790
for example the issue reporters has a

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,780
super increase and how does it change

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,280
and the two when the environment to

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,000
change

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,760
the community do some adjustments and

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,510
the ways they hope that is the

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,930
adjustment would improve the practice or

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:34,660
the quantity then the question is do the

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:38,090
adjustment really here the practice and

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:44,150
the third health improves the quality of

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:47,840
information when deciding here we just

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,690
give an example how how's the issue

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:59,710
tracking data is they like this is a

00:04:50,690 --> 00:05:03,290
drunk alone this is the interface of p2

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,750
into based on the young foot issues

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,960
vacuum cleaner it presents different

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:14,300
kinds of views for example this is the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:17,540
workflow of the issue report on every

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,260
issue that from some status for example

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:25,010
bomb and confirmed or from you when i

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,210
switch to some other status for example

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:33,680
hit information or just as switch to

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:39,070
resort and this window shows if a issue

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:44,560
is resolved it has some resolution tab

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:49,010
are attached to that issue for below it

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,400
included duplicate fixed incomplete and

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:57,260
something like that it's over budget

00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,919
resolution caps okay if so we have this

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:08,750
to how they use it to help the

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:14,090
development practice oh very oh it has

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:16,110
you you could use p22 spawned changes

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,350
and the quantified you learn

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,230
and the effort of issue resolution here

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,860
we give to match with you could give

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:29,030
some suggestions about if this to

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:33,600
mattress make sense because we are

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:37,920
sending emails to the projects or

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,440
communities we have done this work and

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,870
hope to give some are to get some

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,530
feedback for example the students

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:50,310
quality is the time spend ninety percent

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:53,520
of issues resolved in love of month

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,760
issue quality is a fraction of the

00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,080
issues fixed not duplicate not

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:06,930
incomplete exactly fixed okay this is

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:11,400
really this three-step illustrate how a

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:14,190
user could they use p2 to locate some

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:21,090
changes and quantified the issue

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:26,940
resolution practices ok below I well I

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:30,780
well give an example how we found some

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:36,240
change and practice attack patient in

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:39,930
the history of Cologne okay ah in the

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,600
September of two thousand six kilo want

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:48,120
to encourage our recording before they

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:52,550
upgraded the bad body they're reporting

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,160
to okay to a new version that version

00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:02,400
enables users to stop me to pass without

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:05,700
installing send mail but if ya when you

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,870
use glum if you server or if you if you

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:13,400
are you you platform Colossians then the

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:19,189
bad part ii will report the crash or are

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:24,360
automatically to bug available below

00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:29,580
okay now we use this to go back to

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:36,810
September 2006 and the see if you really

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:40,829
achieved its goal because he up hey Z as

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:45,839
a community operated advantage of this

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:51,329
new version we hoped to see they inherit

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:56,940
more about reports and yes I do we could

00:08:51,329 --> 00:09:01,529
see they really achieve that during 2006

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:09,060
September this is the huge peak of a new

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:15,389
heart report during that time it looks

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:19,100
like everything going well but during

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:26,610
our for among those and reports lantus

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:30,050
represent were your valid reports then

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:35,370
the question is why so many valid issues

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:39,600
and if we look I to the workflow of

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:43,110
those human issues we could see the

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,980
process I like this this issues started

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:52,890
from and conformed to get info that

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:57,690
means most of the issues a lot were not

00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:01,529
complete before the community marketer

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,779
those issues as idiom for but most of

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:09,740
the issues just that nobody would come

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,740
back to fail to to complete these issues

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,649
and how about those humanity issues how

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:22,220
about the service quality it took six

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:28,279
point eighty a month to resolve lanta

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:33,110
consent issues okay and that the issue

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:35,510
was a botanist for for the community

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,589
during that time the for new

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,350
technologies and their practices were

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:46,370
imported on one time they used some new

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:50,270
technology follows FF to provide trace

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:54,110
information for those humanity reports

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:58,190
second we just escaped they need to you

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:02,050
for standard close those avenger reports

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:05,570
directly with insufficient information

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:08,930
okay after that as we closely on one

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:13,520
hand the quality of report didn't

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:18,130
increase the young valid issues switched

00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:24,070
from learning to send to 20 focused and

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:28,850
the quality of rape reports wrist and

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:33,160
because they closed the numerator issues

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:39,160
directly from and conform the two resort

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:42,620
the phone the service increased to

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:48,070
compared to six month now it is just

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:52,839
took one month to resolve land g % issue

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:58,160
okay that's just a simple example we use

00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:00,320
p2 to investigate alone rapidly from

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,990
this example actually there are many

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:10,390
other examples we have found on chrome

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:15,280
and mozilla if so what cool

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:18,910
p to help you yesterday once more okay

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,990
first of course support the changes in

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:26,140
this case it could sparked the changes

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,220
brought by hot body reports quickly

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:33,850
because we already have done something

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:38,860
about Archer to detect but by the

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:44,080
content second based on their their

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:48,400
practices under the the the adjustments

00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:53,020
of the community made on the practice we

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:57,460
have different approaches to quantify

00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:01,780
the impact of employment search of

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,590
course if we have to face the same

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:08,530
situation we could think about

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:13,630
alternatives to improve the practice for

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:17,470
example we could use some rules to close

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,870
invalid report automatically that crew

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:25,000
to improve the service quality or the

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:29,290
issue quality in summary p 2 could help

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,940
improve the quality of information to

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:38,500
help you make decisions one a practice

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,260
change now we are trying to apply this

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,000
to you both commercial and the open

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,370
source projects to help disk our the

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,610
efficiencies for the best practices in

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,850
issue resolution practices if you are

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:59,640
interested you could access this URL
