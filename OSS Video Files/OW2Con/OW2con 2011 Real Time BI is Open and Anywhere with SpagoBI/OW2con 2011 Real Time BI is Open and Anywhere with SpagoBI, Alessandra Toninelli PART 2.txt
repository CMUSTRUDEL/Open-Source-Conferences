Abstract: Real time business intelligence (RT BI) allows the analysis of business data as soon as they occur. Differently from traditional BI systems, where data are retrieved and analyzed offline, RT BI requires to gather relevant information by processing data on-the-fly as they flow between enterprise systems. Still, the potential of having real time data at hand remains largely unexploited unless the user has immediate access to them, regardless of where (s)he is and which device (s)he is using. Novel BI systems should support data analysis and delivery to the user not only in real time, but also at any place.
SpagoBI, the 100% open source BI suite, has evolved to address these challenges. Its 3.0 version supports the real time monitoring, analysis and presentation of business data and processes. SpagoBI combines the features of Business Activity Monitoring platform with advanced data analysis and presentation capabilities, including reports, KPIs and interactive charts. In addition, it provides functionalities to allow business users to receive information on existing critical situations in real time, no matter where s/he is. Users can visualize data online on their mobile devices, such as tablets and smart phones, as well as download them for later offline analysis. This way, they can detect inefficiencies and bottlenecks in business processes, promptly react to events requiring quick decision making, and discover new business opportunities hidden in their own data.
