	Speaker: Alessandra Toninelli, SpagoBI Consultant Engineering Group, Italy
Abstract: Real time business intelligence (RT BI) allows the analysis of business data as soon as they occur. Differently from traditional BI systems, where data are retrieved and analyzed offline, RT BI requires to gather relevant information by processing data on-the-fly as they flow between enterprise systems. Still, the potential of having real time data at hand remains largely unexploited unless the user has immediate access to them, regardless of where (s)he is and which device (s)he is using. Novel BI systems should support data analysis and delivery to the user not only in real time, but also at any place.
SpagoBI, the 100% open source BI suite, has evolved to address these challenges. Its 3.0 version supports the real time monitoring, analysis and presentation of business data and processes. SpagoBI combines the features of Business Activity Monitoring platform with advanced data analysis and presentation capabilities, including reports, KPIs and interactive charts. In addition, it provides functionalities to allow business users to receive information on existing critical situations in real time, no matter where s/he is. Users can visualize data online on their mobile devices, such as tablets and smart phones, as well as download them for later offline analysis. This way, they can detect inefficiencies and bottlenecks in business processes, promptly react to events requiring quick decision making, and discover new business opportunities hidden in their own data.

from mobile devices basically when

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,309
implementing a mobile solution in this

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,130
case one can go for the native solution

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,599
which means i will implement say a

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:18,690
mobile client for iOS or android for a

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,150
blackberry and so on of course this is

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,189
this might be very nice from the look

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,900
and feel viewpoint but I have to

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,390
reimplement the application every time

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,269
and second and more important probably

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,149
reason every time the operating system

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,420
gets updated every time there's a new

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,059
version released the application well ok

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,309
let's say can work it may work but most

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,000
likely it will have some problems so a

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,570
more portable approach it's portable on

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,809
across time let's say and platforms it's

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,850
to go with web standards for example

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:57,989
html5 and CSS of course this is what we

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:04,799
did and it's clear that I am encouraging

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:11,040
this approach so I will now move to our

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:15,000
solution just a quick overview on who

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,689
can provide these features that we have

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,670
say sad sorry there are several features

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,250
that are needed so it's better to have a

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,960
sweet because one tool it's very

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,520
difficult that one tool can address all

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,409
these needs and in the open source world

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,930
so there are commercial and actually

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,090
proprietary vendors providing real-time

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,820
BI solutions but Sparky is currently

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,490
only open source and free solution which

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,200
provides real-time VI functionalities

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,320
and real-time anywhere bii and I will

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,530
show you how basically we have already

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,630
discussed a lot of technical issues just

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,329
few words on Spago bi Spago bi is a

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,060
sweet so it has its built in a modular

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,329
way it covers a number of analytical

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,210
areas from reporting where to begin

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:10,009
charts dashboards or lab data mining and

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,290
so on and now real-time bi features

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,599
and it's a completely open source entry

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,090
so there's no duyvil double licensing

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,849
system it's just free and open source

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,000
the business model is built around

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:25,849
project so we will be I projects that's

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,440
where we give added value or possibly

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,079
vertical applications we provide

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,349
training but the core business is on

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:36,379
projects and that's the idea so now

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,599
among its functionalities sebago bhai

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,629
has real-time functionalities I think I

00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,680
will go to the picture because i think

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:48,500
it's ok this is similar to the one half

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,030
shown before and although it's there are

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,250
many many things but i think in the end

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:57,819
it will be very clear so Spock OPI

00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:01,609
provides three let's say features

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:06,470
fundamental parts to achieve real time

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:10,190
anywhere bi first it integrates a ba-bam

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,620
tool this tool is called sorry bum

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,230
there's no time to dive into details but

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,799
this is also an open source project

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,629
basically eben provides the cep engine

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,180
so the complex event processing engine

00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,989
even is responsible for the tactic

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,510
events from it original data sources so

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,829
it has adapters and from selected data

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:35,900
it raises events then we come to spark

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,859
the eye this is also Spock OVI because

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,129
val di receives events and it provides

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:46,010
alarms and notification services

00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:51,530
visualization as features with console

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:55,430
and dashboard consoles are more console

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,620
provides a detailed view at a very fine

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,099
granularity so for example in a console

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,799
i will show you this because it's easier

00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:06,120
this is an example of console in a real

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,069
business scenario we have

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,170
that's a real business case where we

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,069
have implemented the spam system you can

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,840
see in the console I have a very fine

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,870
monitoring here I have a number of these

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,699
are single point of reservation for

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,100
health care treatments and I can see

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,100
each of them and similarly with

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,440
processes we have another now another

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,930
project with a utility company here I

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,880
can see all processes in the BPM and I

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,790
can see which state they are and i can

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,280
take actions if i want so if i see that

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,350
the product the process is blocked for

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,780
example it has been highlighted by an

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,010
operator because someone is asking okay

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,620
look at this something is not working

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,210
okay then i can take an action I can go

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,789
on the console the console is

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,010
bidirectional and I can send it to

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,229
another state for example or i can email

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,479
a responsible and so on so these are

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,699
console and the second visualization

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,150
modality of those events are dashboards

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,669
this is a dashboard again in the same

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,350
example of the utility company a

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,870
dashboard works at the higher level so

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,030
it provides aggregated data in this case

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,900
for example I know you can't see very

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,870
well but a basically we are providing an

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,660
overview of again those processes in the

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,060
BPM and we are grouping by category so

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,729
it's a high level analysis and I can see

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,370
the percentage of each process in each

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:32,310
state for the technology of process so

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,130
it's a higher level business analysis

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:39,810
and this is for visualization and I'm

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:42,360
sorry go back here beside this console

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,430
and dashboard real time we have all

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,070
other Spago bi engines this is a big

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,669
advantage because we can store data and

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,800
then we can perform compare analysis

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,680
real-time historical data we can have

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,210
dash for charts kpi whatever because

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,889
they are already available in spa go bi

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,740
so that's the big advantage of having a

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,919
sweet finally but that's also they're

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,090
important now a spa will be high in the

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:13,320
3.0 version has mobile access to be i

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,960
document so i have this VI documents

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,219
console dashboard and so on and i can

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,219
see them from my mobile device

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,979
as I was saying before we have chosen to

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,899
implement this solution in a portable

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,339
following a portable approach so this is

00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:35,099
web-based we use html5 and css3 on the

00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,949
mobile client and basically Spago bi

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,479
server is accessible with the web

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,509
interface so this is a very portable

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:47,039
solution and one can see VI documents on

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:50,039
its mobile device so this is the whole

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,490
approach the event detection with the

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,099
bomb tool event visualization action on

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,409
the system console dashboard alarms and

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:00,509
notification with all components all

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,819
other engines if I want to perform

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,339
further analysis and finally mobile

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,479
access to be I documents and this shows

00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:11,490
how the solution is complete and

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,830
provides real-time bi functionalities so

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,990
this we have already seen just to show

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,990
that we are really this is a very recent

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,029
project so it's really very active and

00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,680
desert it's quite hot let's say because

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,240
they're really requesting so it's a real

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,409
need not something we have thought about

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:35,039
and that's what we are actually doing so

00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:39,599
I think the only the only thing i want

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,499
to add is the last thing is this real

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,139
time and anywhere bi features are free

00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,669
and open source and that's so far the

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,550
only system free and open source

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:54,769
providing all these functionalities

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,769
