Description: 
	Speaker: Alessandra Toninelli, SpagoBI Consultant Engineering Group, Italy
Abstract: Real time business intelligence (RT BI) allows the analysis of business data as soon as they occur. Differently from traditional BI systems, where data are retrieved and analyzed offline, RT BI requires to gather relevant information by processing data on-the-fly as they flow between enterprise systems. Still, the potential of having real time data at hand remains largely unexploited unless the user has immediate access to them, regardless of where (s)he is and which device (s)he is using. Novel BI systems should support data analysis and delivery to the user not only in real time, but also at any place.
SpagoBI, the 100% open source BI suite, has evolved to address these challenges. Its 3.0 version supports the real time monitoring, analysis and presentation of business data and processes. SpagoBI combines the features of Business Activity Monitoring platform with advanced data analysis and presentation capabilities, including reports, KPIs and interactive charts. In addition, it provides functionalities to allow business users to receive information on existing critical situations in real time, no matter where s/he is. Users can visualize data online on their mobile devices, such as tablets and smart phones, as well as download them for later offline analysis. This way, they can detect inefficiencies and bottlenecks in business processes, promptly react to events requiring quick decision making, and discover new business opportunities hidden in their own data.

the topic of this talk will be so real

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,740
time the eye and the way our what is

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,560
real be a real time bi for us and how

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,910
Spago bi provides real-time bi

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,519
functionalities basically it will be

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,400
what are we talking about what they what

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,920
is it and why it's useful what do we

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,480
need from a technical viewpoint to

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,180
achieve real time by features and how

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:40,290
Spago bi has addressed this challenge of

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,260
providing real-time bi features why so

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,660
why the thing is relevant what's the

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,340
motivation here because of course we we

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,170
need a motivation for everything we do

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,110
otherwise it's just a buzzword but it's

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,629
not basically we have already said today

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,199
things are moving fast at the very fast

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:02,820
pace today and a crucial need for

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,220
enterprises is to be let's say to have

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,610
access to information that is relevant

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,479
to them on time on time does not

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,840
necessarily mean quickly very quickly it

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,479
means when you need it so we have the

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,200
relevant part which means we don't need

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,330
all data we need data that really create

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,720
create information for us that is

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,430
relevant for the business and let's say

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,360
for our customers because we we work

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,170
with them and on time so really what we

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,299
need it this helps so this has a number

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,490
of advantages so having access to

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,520
relevant information on time means that

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,920
I can react quickly if I see that

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
something is happening I can react at

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,060
the time when this reaction is needed so

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,399
now afterwards I can detect that

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,369
something is not working properly so for

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,170
example there are inefficiencies in my

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:04,079
in my firm in my processes there's a

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,909
bottle like something that needs that be

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,310
reaction and decision this can be a

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,280
let's say at a technical level for

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,450
example if I am monitoring a

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,790
telecommunication infrastructure I know

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,220
and I see there's a problem on a node or

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,260
I see in my business process process

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,420
this block but it can also be at a

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,010
business level so monitoring the system

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,700
using this irrelevant information can

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:34,209
help making decisions in time and this

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,920
is the crucial point so real time bi is

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:44,370
about providing an egg's about sorry

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:48,970
analyzing actual events business events

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,060
when they occur I also added the react

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,620
to just because we are talking about

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,549
analyzing data so being providing with

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,950
the extra information and take decision

00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,860
so first of all we are not really

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,040
talking about data anymore but we are

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,670
more talking about events this is a

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,070
higher level because it's not like

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,079
collecting all data we have for example

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,239
from an operational system and I'm

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,180
storing them in the beta without and

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,220
then going and filtering all the data

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,650
and see okay this hand if this is

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,819
happening this happened some some days

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,209
ago or whatever it's about putting the

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:33,940
BI system in the middle of the data flow

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,819
so one systems are communicating and

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,359
extracting relevant events when they

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:43,660
happen so for example if I see that an

00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:46,660
order has been issued but the goods have

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,609
not been shipped then I can say okay

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,739
maybe there's a problem in my stocks I

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,410
should refill them and I don't need to

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,810
see all the data about the the order of

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,440
yesterday and the other days I see this

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,780
as an event because some data in a

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,450
logical order or chronological maybe

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,290
generate a relevant event so that's the

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:11,319
key point that we real time by provide

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,400
events and the second key point which is

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,419
different from traditional via

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,840
is that users business users can also

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,770
react to those events so normally we

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,009
think of bi as a set of tools something

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,830
that provides data to business users

00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,199
they look at data and say okay they make

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,780
analysis that's it but there's generally

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,530
no reaction on the system in this case

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:44,000
real-time bi has also focus on allowing

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,220
this reaction so for example I can I can

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,979
have a let's say x direction or

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,780
interaction data towards business user

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,240
but also the business user can do

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,400
something on data for example I see that

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,470
a process in my business process

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,600
management system is blocked ok I will

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,610
do something I would send an email to

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,639
the responsible i will move this process

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,780
in another state and this is another a

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,190
crucial point that is different from

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,560
traditional VI so these are just

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,270
examples of application areas basically

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,169
we have already made examples of this

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,690
this is just to say we often think of

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,940
real-time VI in terms of monitoring a

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,680
technical level so as we said

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,810
telecommunication infrastructure as a

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,330
service level agreement which is true

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,630
but this can also happen at a higher

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,979
level so as we said for example if we

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,280
have a business process management

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:40,630
system in place monitoring the BPM is

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,159
really a high-level business kind of

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,169
analysis because I'm really watching at

00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,710
what's happening in the performance of

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,080
my business processes so this idea of

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,430
real-time the I can be applied at

00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:00,770
different levels and not just technical

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:04,039
given this idea of providing events to

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:09,310
business users on time there's a

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:11,960
question arising it's quite clear that

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,740
location lets a user mobility becomes a

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,940
critical when we want to deliver

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,409
business events on time because nowadays

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,569
okay we know it's a time but it's true

00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:27,199
and it's really becoming true in the

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,389
as well users move and use mobile

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,270
devices so we can think of a salesman

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,919
for example but this is true more and

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,319
more everywhere and it's not just

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,459
because tablet I mean the ipad is nice

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,439
of course but the thing is as actually

00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:45,379
Tom pointed out before at there's an

00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,469
expectation from business users to be

00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:53,089
able to use their devices and see data

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:57,289
on their devices so if I want to see my

00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:59,149
business events on time of course it's

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,789
even more important that this can happen

00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,800
when I am moving when I am using my

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,129
tablet and look just because I'm sitting

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,860
in front of my computer so and beside

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,899
time space becomes a critical factor and

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,289
we think that it's not possible to

00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:18,680
really approach real-time bi without

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:21,619
thinking of mobility so real time should

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,889
also be anywhere bi these are a

00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:27,169
different aspect so the same problem

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:30,889
let's say so it's real time anywhere bi

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:34,219
and this is actually our approach from a

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,860
technological viewpoint which are the

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:39,349
same for structures what do we need if

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,969
we want to achieve real time anywhere bi

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:46,219
so um the first thing we need it's a

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:50,360
actually it's a very broad idea is a

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:53,839
business activity monitoring platform I

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,319
try to summarize with this picture what

00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,829
what day is in inner in a bomb system

00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,300
basically a bomb is a system that

00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:04,669
generated will take generates events

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,029
business events so he is able to detect

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,789
and generate them and make them usable

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:13,879
to business users so those events are

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:16,849
detected from the data flow so basically

00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:20,689
when we have data sources these are data

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:24,079
but then the first feature that we need

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,949
is event detection starting from data so

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,139
that's the first point this is where

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:32,599
normally a complex event processing

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,790
engine works this engine is something

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,800
that based on data and applying

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:41,810
logix some kind of logics which can also

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,760
be temporal this this engine produces

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:48,600
generates events so for example as we

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,880
said before if I have an order that is

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,640
issued and I don't see the shipment of

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,790
goods I can't after let's say a couple

00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,210
of days I can rate the CP raises the

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,370
event that probably stocks are under

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,190
quota because that's there's a logic

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,310
saying this so from data to events this

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,610
is the CEP men events need to be

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,150
presented to the user so we have an

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,490
event with visualization third console

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,070
and dashboards so the visual

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,220
presentation of those business events we

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,680
have an event notification so an alarm

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,050
services basically to say to business

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,600
users hey something has happened and

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,850
this is you see there's a dashed line

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,970
because this is more of traditional bi

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,090
parts beside the real time we can also

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,100
collect historical data and compare them

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,440
to real-time data because this gives

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,630
added value of course I can compare the

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,080
two and see what's happening although

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,600
this as we said where I store data and I

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,730
make statistical historical analysis

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,380
this is more traditional bi but it can

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,690
be coupled to real time and this

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,380
provides added value and of course the

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,360
final targets are users so users sitting

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,780
in front of a computer or moving and

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,000
that's the the second aspect so beside

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:14,160
building a business activity monitoring

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,490
system we also need to provide access to

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,520
be I documents or tools from mobile

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,520
