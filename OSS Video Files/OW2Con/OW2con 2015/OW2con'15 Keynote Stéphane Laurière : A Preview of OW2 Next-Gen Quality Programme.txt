Title: OW2con'15 Keynote Stéphane Laurière : A Preview of OW2 Next-Gen Quality Programme
Publication date: 2015-11-23
Playlist: OW2con 2015
Description: 
	Software is eating the world and open source licenses are eating software. This leads to the presence of OSS in nearly all the electronic systems we interact with daily, such as communication devices, cars, trains, healthcare systems, entertainment environments. This entails that the quality of the OSS components we use and produce is getting progressively as important as the quality of the air we breathe. One of the OW2 key missions is to continously design and implement a roadmap for enabling quality and trustworhy open source software, through a dedicated platform named SQuAT. This talk will present the status and the future of this platform, its underlying models and tools, and how you can use it for assessing and improving the quality of your project.

	00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,410
this time I will focus on the quality

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,599
program I'll cook for next year is more

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,220
again a proposal and subject to

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,650
discussion with you later on the

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,930
proposal is to put the focus on three

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,789
main axis at the core the the the

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,840
quality program would revolve around

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,719
mainly a model the open maitre d model

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,760
that is something that captures what we

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,399
mean by quality so this would be the

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,969
core but as I said earlier we will need

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,149
to work again around this model because

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,510
it has to adapt to modern times so to

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:56,730
say the second axis is what makes it

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,710
possible to feed this model and this is

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,230
the platform the quality analysis

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,840
platform on the left side which will

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:09,210
compute metrics analyze the project and

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,400
bring data into the model and on the

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,280
right side we will have to work on the

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,670
dashboard which will reflect the status

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,770
of the open source project at hand

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,140
especially in the app marketplace that

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,000
elects to is presented so this hook

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,960
these are this would be the three

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,369
cornerstones of the quality program to

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:37,890
be discussed so let's start with the

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:40,710
model that we could call version 2 which

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,530
as I proposed earlier which we may

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,320
create a work group that would

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:50,880
specifically work on on it with open

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,750
registration we may start with a market

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,259
analysis that is ok we do quality but

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,350
what does the market wants what the Big

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,930
industry players need to know about open

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,960
source software quality in order to make

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,740
better decisions so this is where orange

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,540
and other big players might

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:17,420
I pin but beside the industry axis we

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,760
also have research because quality is

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:25,940
highly technical so we may try to

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,370
involve more researchers like he's the

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,800
funnel here and many others who know

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,540
very much about quality and the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:40,130
theoretical underpinnings of it we

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,290
already have possible collaboration at

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,750
least Kapoor the China Chinese the

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,670
government agency for open source

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,450
development in Chinese China has

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:54,200
expressed an interest in this kind of

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:57,490
collaboration and there are two are

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,980
little icons there on the bottom right

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,930
one is the recent program launched by

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,970
the Linux Foundation called the Linux

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,630
Foundation batch program which from what

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:13,120
I understood was a follow-up of the

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:17,720
heartbleed a failure the United States

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,910
decided that it was a huge risk and they

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,370
wanted to anticipate possible other

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:28,040
failures and they at least fostered the

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,160
creation of this group which creates its

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,860
own model it's called the batter program

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,780
model there is an open discussion about

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:41,800
it they have I think 3g criteria so far

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,920
so we're not competing but we can have

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,500
synergies and see how they evolve and

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,290
which metrics could be integrated in our

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,300
own model and the second one is called

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,830
easy to maintain that commits it's a

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,510
project rate by a French guy in yon who

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,390
started to analyze projects on github

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,330
according to 2 matrix one is the

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,240
well-known median time resolution matrix

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,400
and the other one is the open issues

00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,030
percentage compared with the total

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,440
number of issues so it's not two metrics

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,660
but he managed to get some some some up

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,790
take some community uptake around it and

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,580
the median time resolution is not

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:29,860
trivial either so maybe it's an

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:35,479
interesting metric we could integrate so

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:39,110
our oh mmv to next is the question about

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:41,419
how to implement this model in the real

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:46,580
world for this we need an infrastructure

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:49,100
that you can see here with several

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:55,130
layers from the user management up to

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:59,210
the user interfaces and you have here a

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:02,600
number of solutions and the quality

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,070
analysis is up at the top with several

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,370
ones that were using at the moment

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:11,150
sonarqube for IP check currently we use

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:15,020
facility but we may assess other

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,340
solutions same thing for originality

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,950
check for governance analysis and for

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:26,080
somehow new realm in itself which is

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:31,880
developed for which we have not match

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:35,330
criterion or tooling today there will be

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,880
a bigger bigger axis and in need of

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,539
those of you who are skilled in in all

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:48,890
these tools implementation and the three

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:50,750
taxes will be to improve the dashboards

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,630
we have already started you can see a

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,060
preview at projects that a w-2 that org

00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:01,070
we have new dashboards based on extra

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:04,810
key and g3 d3 the JavaScript library for

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:10,010
data visualization 11 library went on

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:13,160
and the work for next year will be to

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:16,960
automate small all the production of

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,750
these dashboards also to connect the the

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,550
dashboards with solutions we have at the

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,070
reader to based on spec OB I for

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,520
instance also connect more with Peter J

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,310
people who specialized in open-source

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,560
metrics and develop connectors for

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,350
external application

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,970
to harness all this data within their

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,889
own environment like a pub and also we

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,990
will continue the integration of the

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,600
risk models that we have developed

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,710
within riscos not sure well you heard

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,080
about it but it's it's a it's a work in

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:57,460
progress and something we can put to the

00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:03,040
next level nature I think this is this

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:05,080
is richer any question no no we discuss

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,860
we will continue this discussion at all

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,860
