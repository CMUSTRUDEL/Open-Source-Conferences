Publication date: 2015-11-23
Playlist: OW2con 2015
Description: 
	Software is eating the world and open source licenses are eating software. This leads to the presence of OSS in nearly all the electronic systems we interact with daily, such as communication devices, cars, trains, healthcare systems, entertainment environments. This entails that the quality of the OSS components we use and produce is getting progressively as important as the quality of the air we breathe. One of the OW2 key missions is to continously design and implement a roadmap for enabling quality and trustworhy open source software, through a dedicated platform named SQuAT. This talk will present the status and the future of this platform, its underlying models and tools, and how you can use it for assessing and improving the quality of your project.
