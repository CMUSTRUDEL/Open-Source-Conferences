so the state affordable you to a quick

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,670
overview i'm going to give you first of

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,939
all the an idea of what we're trying to

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,960
achieve at the moment and what we're

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,750
trying to offer our project then i will

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,230
look at the evolution of the membership

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:35,309
then i'll look at the evolution of

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:38,969
project and i'll finish with what we do

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,750
to outreach and to communicate with the

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,030
market so this is a quick overview i'm

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,329
going to be very honest and transparent

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,510
and give you the real figures they're

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:57,239
not all so good but they're not all bad

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:01,199
either and so we do carry on first of

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,700
all our context is of course in the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,939
framework of the four freedoms of free

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,659
software the freedom to use the software

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,880
for whatever purpose the freedom to read

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,360
the software to read the code the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,570
freedom to modify this code and the

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,729
freedom to reduce redistributes modified

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,979
versions of this code and that goes way

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,970
back because that goes way back to the

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,290
early 80s hence the kind of screen we

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:38,579
had when we were dealing with this and

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:42,950
we also come from object web which in

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:49,369
the early 2000 was a repository of code

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:54,240
that was developed by a consortium of

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:56,460
inria bull and orange and they started

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,439
developing this code base but that was

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,280
not the foundation there was no

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,180
organization rounded and that's why I in

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,910
2007 we worked out a plan to develop an

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,140
organization and this is one of the

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,569
slides we we used in

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,990
thousand and six when we drafted the

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:22,640
plan for w2 and that's still very valid

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,770
and these are the component of four w2

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,880
first of all to code base exam mission

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,790
is to develop an NGO based of

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,920
open-source infrastructure software then

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,730
this code base is developed by your

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,780
community and we work for our members

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,550
for community this community work the

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,320
project in the framework of activities

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,640
these activities are the the project and

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,459
what we call the initiatives which are

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,250
market oriented activities everything

00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:00,870
operates in the framework of a

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,489
transparent governance and we are an

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,400
independent we remain an independent

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:12,959
organization because we rely on our

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,330
members members fees so we are really an

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,920
independent one of the top five

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,010
independence organizations in the world

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,420
if we compare ourselves to the Linux

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,040
Foundation the Eclipse Foundation the

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,850
Apache foundation and the OpenStack

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,930
foundation so we are the audibility to

00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,769
consortium we not have one of those

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,600
foundations and our job here as a

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,760
foundation or a multi-purpose

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,680
organization is to help develop an

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,900
ecosystem so because we understand that

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,190
it's not that only technology but it's

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,370
about the it's about welfare it's about

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,230
creating value and trying to control

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,680
this value for the good of our members

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,600
so the organization we've put together

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,519
is implemented this platform strategy

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:06,450
and the platform's probably something

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:08,910
that addresses more than one market we

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,660
address the users but we also address

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,880
the code produces so as an organization

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,340
we work for the project leaders with we

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,280
work for the developers but we also work

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,860
for them for the market we try to

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,599
address needs out there in the market

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,050
and we should help the market find our

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,940
coats

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:33,080
to do that we implement three kind of

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,840
services a technical infrastructure

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,389
which are technical services to enable

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,940
the word the project work together then

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,830
we provide community services where you

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,660
call community services which we also

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,509
call the governance which is very

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,830
important for us and we also provide

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:55,490
maybe outreach activities or marketing

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,850
services to connect the project with the

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,919
market so these are three types of

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,320
services and that's what 4s constitute

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,419
it's the basis of our platform strategy

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,300
but in other words you need to have in

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,610
mind a another concept is that of three

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,930
layers because that was a picture but

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,289
now how we we develop this long time

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:23,780
this is a slide I presented two or three

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:26,509
years ago which is a summary of how

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,910
we've been evolving we've evolved by

00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,560
positioning go w to on certain

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,570
technologies we start with cloud

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,389
computing now we are trying to be

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,310
proactive in the Big Data Andrea we're

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,380
trying to be proactive in the Internet

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,270
of Things area and we also trying to be

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,750
proactive in the privacy and security

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,789
areas which are four areas that where

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,789
we're trying to be proactive we think

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,870
vision of the future is that

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,949
applications in the future we have that

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,889
as a backdrop cloud computing big data

00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:00,349
privacy security and individual things

00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,820
so that's the technology positioning but

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:03,830
it's not enough to do that this

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,280
positioning we need to have a quality

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,400
project and we have developed a quality

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,169
program we call it squat at the moment

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,750
for software quality assurance and

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,479
trustworthiness and we are working and

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,199
involving it and Stefan lawyers e LWT

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,490
CTO will introduce the campaign position

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,970
will show you the kind of operations we

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,889
are implementing we may even change the

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,139
name order this is a quality program a

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:32,150
disability program once we are quality

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,770
project we think we can expose them to

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,600
the market we think we can go to the

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,310
market we can be proud of them and

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,060
push them to the market and pushing them

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:43,850
to the market means for us developing

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,730
marketplace so that's that's the what we

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,970
are busy doing at the moment within the

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:53,060
w2 is developing the code base along

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,270
these technology areas making sure that

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,910
our project our quality project and then

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,150
trying to push this push this market or

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,450
make the market make this project easily

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,600
accessible by by user that on the market

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,910
and to do this we are implementing our

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,460
governance strategy and our government

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,820
strategy if you look from left to right

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,940
on this slide it means that first of all

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,000
we need to be selective with a project

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:27,880
so we have been reconsidering our code

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,310
base along the the last 12 18 years and

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,040
identifying and sorting the the quality

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,710
project and we ask the project to really

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,380
implement best practices in project

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,270
management that's why for us it's very

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,280
governance is important it's part of the

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,510
governance our expectation for the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,370
project to implement those best

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,640
practices in open source project

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,260
management is part of our governance

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,510
because the governance will be kind of

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,310
helping them to do that but also taking

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,310
that and that's what this little

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:05,480
document document with the pen means

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:08,420
when we when we upgrade project from the

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,520
incubation status to the majors Metro

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:15,800
status and then we we also have this

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,170
quality program that that we develop

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,340
this quality program has been developed

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:25,810
by using quality tools measurement tools

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,730
and we've also been leveraging a

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,250
cooperative project financed by the

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,740
european commission called riscos that

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:39,770
you see there to try to put this

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:42,950
together into and try to create like a

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,120
single indicator or label or something

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,089
that is a specific toward ability to and

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,360
that may we make it

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:53,430
friends for the four first or the other

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,259
beauty project and then for the beach as

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,620
a community so people will understand

00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,370
that this project are can be trusted and

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:05,550
our quirky project and then we have been

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,870
busy developing the marketplace so the

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,209
monthly basis is something now we can

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,220
preview today and that's very important

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,559
today's very important because we

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,120
starting putting everything together and

00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:20,100
this marketplace has three big part

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,529
going from the bottom to the top and we

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,850
have been leveraging again kiribati of

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,209
project financed by the european

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,189
commission to to develop this the first

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,790
one is the bottom one is the directory

00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:34,439
which is the part where the project can

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,389
be registered and can be discovered by

00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:38,759
the market then there's the factory

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,850
which is the part where you can create

00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,490
the template that will help deploy this

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,209
project very very easily so we want to

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:52,170
make the project very easily accessible

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:53,759
and the next part is the store and the

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,399
store is where the project will be

00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,279
showcased whether people will actually

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,029
get to know what was the offering out

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,730
there so this today the stages of this

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,980
today is that of a collaborative project

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,079
but then there is something else we're

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,899
going to do specifically for w2 and

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,139
that's what I would like to call our

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,199
enablement strategy if you allow me this

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:22,019
with this word again if you look at the

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:24,899
left of this slide we have this app her

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,300
project the hyper project is developing

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,990
the marketplace and this multi place

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:35,929
today is developed for the benefit of

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:39,209
other European projects other SMEs and

00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:42,800
for the other beautiful project now with

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:45,929
the app hub as a European project theme

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,730
that the mission will be to make this

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:51,389
proper the project that are registered

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,309
on the marketplace available that's one

00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:56,040
thing but what we going to do with the

00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:57,720
w2 and specifically the liberty project

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,110
up at the end of this project that is

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,670
towards the end of 2016

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,800
something we're going to take this one

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,329
step further and that's why why our

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,010
coordinate movement is that the

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,620
marketplace will be the place where the

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:13,579
project leaders are the companies behind

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,279
the project will be able to sell their

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:21,040
additional services that could be

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,300
expertise systems integration hosting a

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,550
complementary product cetera so these

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:30,010
will be available from the marketplace

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:33,500
and with this we will help project

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,050
implement a true open source business

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,490
model and monetize the development

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,209
efforts and that's what I called the

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:45,500
enablement that's where I want to use

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:48,079
that word in a bit I don't I didn't find

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,450
a better word but Sir it really means

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,550
taking the adobe to project one step

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,519
further and into the market so that's

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,200
what we're doing and we're busy

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,769
implementing it and we will be showing

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:06,680
you the the quality program and the

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:08,120
marketplace now figures I said that

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,320
would be very honest so i'm going to

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,300
show you the figures about the corporate

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,300
members figures about the individual

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,190
members figures about the the number of

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,529
project we have and figures about the

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,440
downloads on this project first of all

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:24,079
the corporate members a membership fees

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,320
we are low-budget organization so we

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,500
have to be very very agile and

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,529
concentrating resources on where we make

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,420
the the most the most efficient and

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,070
we'll make the best impact so what we

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,160
see here is that we have we bought the

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,589
revolution 2013 has not been a very good

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,860
year for w2 but i think we are

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:51,110
recovering and we are getting signing up

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,209
new members now individual members you

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,570
can see here the devolution of the

00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,630
individual members and the colors on the

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,100
right shows the show them that your

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,430
graphical footprint of all the beauty

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:09,890
but let's go to the left first we've had

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,959
a number of annual registration of

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,660
individual members and then it's been a

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,640
drop and the drop has been caused by the

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,459
fact that we have changed our rules

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,949
meaning that we would we decided not to

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,610
accept as individual members employees

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,790
of corporate members just because we

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,500
cannot be bound with members with two

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,160
contracts so it's been a little bit

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,949
complicated but having done that in 2012

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,910
now you see the true evolution of real

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:46,069
third-party individual members and what

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:49,220
I can say is that it's it's going up now

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:50,839
what you see on the right is what i call

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,360
the geographical footprint of order me

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:58,010
to the inner circle shows the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,300
distribution the geographic distribution

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,699
of individual members the of the total

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,810
number of individual members that is of

00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:11,899
the 2140 members registered as of last

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,620
week and what and what the outer circle

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:18,399
shows is the distribution of the new

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,319
members that jointed ability to in 2015

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:27,350
so the difference there is that we did

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:29,329
have a very strong percentage of French

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,760
and European it was about have enough

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:33,800
but what happened in 2015 for some

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,029
reason we can analyze that I think it's

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,470
a part of our a growing visibility

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:43,790
within the European Commission I think

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:49,730
we've had a very high number of high

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:52,699
proportion of new members from from

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,370
Europe I mean from countries outside of

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:58,690
France in Europe and i think is a good

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,579
time because i think because developing

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,600
our membership towards the other

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,120
countries in europe is one of our

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,410
priorities so that's for the individual

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,740
members evolution now the new projects

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:15,709
we we have we host today about 100

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,010
project out of which a good 50 project

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:21,130
or I mean active and mature project

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:27,220
which we can count on

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:29,620
and this this line shows the project we

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,990
are registering each year and this year

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,010
with we are registering their five

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,350
projects two of them or pathogen artist

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,970
or a project from the European

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:45,900
Commission and and the other three are

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,490
third-party projects of companies that

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,410
except for vespa but companies that are

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:55,110
not members over the beauty so this it

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:59,020
shows how we are becoming visible and

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,480
attractive to do the outside of the

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,650
inner circle of our community of course

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:08,230
this is I think it's we can we can

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,700
probably do better but that's where the

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,050
whole community has to become more

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,140
active the downloads downloads so you

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:20,890
see the whole zip download transitions

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,100
since the beginning of 2002 of the

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:27,700
repository so what this line shows first

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,700
of all is that I makes a bit of a bumpy

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,340
bumpy ride it really depends on the

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,500
success of some of the projects so we

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:41,200
had stopped star project that suddenly

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,510
disappear because of an evolution sudden

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,570
pushing the technology then replace all

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:52,170
the project is it a bit bumpy yes and

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:56,140
the weather three lights show really is

00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:00,010
the very high impact of the top ten

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:03,010
project on our alcohol base so there is

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,500
a very high concentration and our

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,360
activity so does it mean that uh w2

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,930
should concentrate its efforts on those

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,439
top ten project I'm not sure because the

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,819
next ten projects maybe are the next top

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,449
10 I mean if you see and somewhat I mean

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,870
we have to keep we have to manage this

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:25,439
churn rate and make sure that we always

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,439
have

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:35,730
I reserve of a project that our been

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,680
coming but it's when I I mean the first

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,950
time I see this and it's been no

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,460
confirmed again this year that the top

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,040
ten project are very important in terms

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,690
of the number of downloads and that may

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,460
be the influence of fertility out there

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,050
on the market right another type of

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,370
project are the collaborative project

00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,640
I've mentioned the European Commission a

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,030
couple of times we are part of the

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,290
European ecosystem and we do spend a

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:10,970
significant amount of our time working

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,780
about being in France or looking at

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,120
project that are financed by the

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,000
European Commission and audibility has

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,950
been reasonably successful in this

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,410
environment because we are regularly

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,350
invited to take part in some of those

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,660
project because we are as an apprentice

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,910
community we provide some sort of

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,330
reference we are we don't compete

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:36,420
against any of the partners that may be

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:41,400
in those project we have a good track

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:44,010
record and we are we are credible so we

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,890
are establishing the b2 as the reference

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,450
open source organization in Europe and

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,830
the context of the European Commission

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,460
so I think we have this kind of

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,190
recognition now and actually we are

00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,360
meeting with them regularly to provide

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:04,800
either recommendations on open source we

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:07,050
are steadily trying to push and

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,670
advocating for open source within the

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:13,530
European Commission and today we are

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,770
what we are currently involved in a

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,650
number of project three there's one that

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,500
is finishing so it's four of which one

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,390
is finishing and we will be working on

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,130
proposals and we've already been invited

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,870
to work in purple so now we're working

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:34,860
on the project that in that will keep us

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:36,900
busy in 2017 and 18 and this projects

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,150
are important because many of the other

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,600
members actually participating the

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,100
consort

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,230
terms and help build project and

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,990
readable this for the benefit of our

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:49,830
members but also as I mentioned for

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:52,559
riscos and up hub a notion this project

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,809
are I mean we we choose the project that

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,520
are synergistic with what we want to

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,160
achieve and that helped us actually

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,169
develop what we want to provide for our

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,120
community so that's the those are the

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,470
cooperative projects now to finish I

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:11,390
want to show you what we do in terms of

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:15,059
market outreach or we take part

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:18,900
officially not as speakers but as a an

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:23,820
organization with booths in about one

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,840
event a month we we are readily invited

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:31,230
by event organizers we can have both or

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,929
we can even sometimes we are interested

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,929
the organization's of food sessions that

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:39,390
we used to promote the community and to

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:42,390
promote our open source project and

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,559
thats also keeps the whole team pretty

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:51,240
busy in terms of governance we have I

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:55,380
mean at least four or five board

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,309
meetings a year so everything everything

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,679
we do at the w 2 and the team that that

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,740
is the management office is done under

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,799
the supervision and of the the board of

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,299
directors so that's the the outlook if

00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,610
there is an event you want to see us in

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:18,500
that is not that is not on this list

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:23,250
please talk to me after at the break

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:26,669
away can always consider where where we

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,370
will be next month we've done also

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:31,480
something that I really want to do i

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,670
light here which is

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,880
and I hope you've noticed that because

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,770
I'm sure you go to our website regularly

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,470
that we've changed the look and feel of

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:45,160
the website and we've evolved the owt

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:48,910
logo so this is the new identity you can

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,330
see it on the screens and it's it's

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,820
something that we've decided to keep the

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,280
0 degree to think go w to although it's

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,580
it's a hell of a word to pronounce in

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,740
several languages it's it's this is

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,180
still an identity so that makes the

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,710
other bit identity it's our brand and we

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,250
just have to keep it we decide to evolve

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,860
it a little bit and and that's now what

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,480
we're going to do to have the website

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,520
also we've changed a little bit of the

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,740
colors so we keep the orange which is

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,020
alteration color but would it be big

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,420
more blue in it and you see the looking

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,590
for the website which is now website you

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,960
can visit on your tablet on your

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,520
preference smartphone so that's that's

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,440
been that's kept us it would be busy

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,390
because Logan is a website is also

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
something we do so who's been doing all

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,340
that well no no something else I need to

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,980
show which is something i haven't

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:49,000
mentioned which is on our mind so there

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,700
is so much to do the the help of the

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,490
communities is welcome if you these are

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,070
the some of the topics we have we have

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,860
on our minds at the moment and the

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:02,260
improving dri for our the blue team

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,300
members mentioned the european

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,540
commission commitments are we doing too

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,920
much more not enough the ability to

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,810
project governance something that is

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,760
very important because we understand why

00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,080
we have this thing this year the drive

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,900
for Pancho's governance which is

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,600
something we still have to fine-tune its

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,520
never completely finished the technology

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,430
council activity is also something that

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,140
we need to pay attention to the carpet

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,110
project to mention we have opportunities

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,390
in china and brazil so how much we

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,530
should spend much efforts we should

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,300
spend their the development of the

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,640
membership in europe something i've

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,520
mentioned which is something wonderful

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,260
priorities we're also thinking of

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,100
stopping

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,890
Oh w2 from a spreadsheet but maybe

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,840
moving to a measuring software there are

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,940
relations with a big European project

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,070
called Phi we're licensed IP the market

00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,680
participant mentioned that we'd like to

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,930
assign a new strategic members may be in

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,390
Europe and then maybe we can change the

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:09,820
status to foundation stages which is

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:11,620
another thing that can be considered in

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,820
order to make it financially more

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,860
attractive for members to go a little

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,580
