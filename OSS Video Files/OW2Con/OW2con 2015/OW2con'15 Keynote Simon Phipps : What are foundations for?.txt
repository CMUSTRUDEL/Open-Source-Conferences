	00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,780
so now what our foundations for is my

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,369
topic and I would like to talk to you

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,460
all about open source foundations I've

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,439
got two affinities here that you can see

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,570
are still a director of the Open Source

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,340
Initiative they of course are very

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,990
concerned about what I say so they've

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,970
got Zach down in the front row here

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,940
who's also a director who's going to

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,700
make sure that I only tell the truth and

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,230
i'm also still on the payroll at wipro

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,750
technologies although not for very much

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,730
longer so i have to tell you straight

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,989
please don't make any more open source

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:52,440
foundations okay we have enough of them

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:54,059
please stop your employer from or if

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,030
you're the head of open source please

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,670
use stop making any new open source

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,500
trade associations we really have enough

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,870
of them I look for a comprehensive list

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,540
of them on the internet and every list i

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,700
looked at was out of date because there

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,060
have been several created since the list

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,600
was made there's many many many of them

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,960
and they largely have the same roster of

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,520
members large corporations and i'm going

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,140
to try and explain that to you now of

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,590
course as with all these things there's

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,869
always a caveat you may find that

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,430
there's a situation where you need to

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,110
create a new foundation but

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,259
fundamentally i have to say to you

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,700
please don't make anymore and you i want

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,070
to see you in my office tomorrow morning

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,780
at nine o'clock with slides if you do

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,140
intend to make another one so we can

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,450
have a good talking-to let's let's

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,909
understand first of all why it is that

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,850
people want to create foundations what

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,030
are the formal roles of foundations that

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,180
the most important formal role of a

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,520
foundation is to be an asset lock now

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,899
what do I mean by an asset log by an

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,439
asset look what I mean is that the

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,840
foundation guarantees that the assets

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,140
that are being used for an open source

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,330
project can only benefit the open source

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,120
project and that those assets can't be

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,700
used

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
to benefit one particular member so you

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,780
put a foundation in place to make sure

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,920
that the trademarks or the aggregated

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:27,209
copyright or the centralized funds can't

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,099
be used solely to benefit one member and

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,670
often an organization will start a

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,200
foundation as a way of symbolically

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,700
guaranteeing that to its community even

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,730
when there is only one organization

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,950
involved now this applies to money it

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,010
applies to trademarks it can apply to

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,230
copyrights it can apply to the direction

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,150
of staff who are employed to make sure

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,970
those staff act on behalf of the

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,040
community and not of a single employer

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,739
but an asset lock is the key attribute

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,810
of an open source foundation second one

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:02,129
is to act as a bank an open source

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,269
foundation I collect donations

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:07,209
distributes those donations in a way

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:10,060
that helps the community typically it

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,349
will do that not by developing code but

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,450
by running conferences like this one by

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,340
sometimes by putting out a tender for a

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,720
function that the community is not able

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,579
to bring the resources together to

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,340
perform such as putting together

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:27,519
infrastructure and it will spend money

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,349
on sustaining the work product of those

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,629
activities that will spend money on on

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:35,620
maintaining infrastructure and servers

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:38,739
and so on the the third role is to be a

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,930
guarantor of equality typically the

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,150
governance of an open source community

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,400
will be anchored somewhere so Jim talked

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,199
about how he incorrectly said that

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,150
dennis is the only guy that can let

00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,870
things into the Linux kernel there's

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,579
actually a group of people who

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,829
collectively consent to things going in

00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,299
the linux kernel then-us happens to be

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,220
the one who normally acts on their on

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,989
their direction but actually there's a

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,000
collective group there they are

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,090
themselves anchored in the Linux

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,760
Foundation and lynus is an employee of

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,650
the Linux Foundation which acts as a

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,389
kind of guarantor of his behavior

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,560
although I'm not sure how well that

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:21,130
works out for Jim's eminent then finally

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,140
foundation is typically an

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,170
infrastructure provider so it's

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,350
typically providing a repository mating

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,320
lists discussion forums increasingly

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,090
it's providing metrics and a business

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,670
intelligence platform that interprets

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,740
those metrics and so those are the

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,690
really the 40 that's why you start a

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,060
foundation is to do those four things

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,080
and the primary function of having our

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,980
foundation is to be an asset lock when I

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,430
say foundation I'm it's a foundation is

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,630
a tricky word because it means different

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,580
words are used in different

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,370
english-speaking countries different

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,710
words are used in other languages to

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,530
describe what's going on by a foundation

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,020
what I mean is an organization which is

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,930
recognized by the government for tax

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,960
purposes as being independent of the

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,400
control of a single entity so for

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,670
example in Germany it might be a

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,910
shifting or an Eevee in the UK it might

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,880
be a registered clarity or a community

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,120
interest company in the u.s. it might be

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,670
a 501 C 3 a 501 C 6 or public benefit

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,600
corporation all of those are the legal

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,300
substrate that can lie underneath a

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,980
foundation but collectively there are a

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,500
foundation and we use them in open

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,670
source to perform these guarantee roles

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,340
now what what is a community because

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,770
exactly a community that is the real

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,200
primary force the foundation is actually

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,080
secondary to the nature of a community

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,440
an open source community is a group of

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,510
individuals or a group of individuals

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,900
acting at the behest of their employers

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,800
who have overlapping self interests and

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,130
those self interests overlap in a code

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,170
Commons and that's what open source

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,900
community is an open source community is

00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,750
not primarily altruistic although it's

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,910
often difficult to function if you don't

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,390
at least have a few good cells in your

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,610
body but primarily an open source

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,580
community is about individuals seeking

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,730
the satisfaction of some needs of their

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,270
own and an open source community works

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,010
best when the ideologies and needs of

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,440
the other participants in the community

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,270
don't

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,300
interfere with your with meeting your

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,190
own needs and so this is the reason why

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,110
foundation is able to work for an open

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,480
source community is that once an open

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,280
source community has set itself up once

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,610
we understand what each other's roles

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,150
and responsibilities are we are able to

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,530
then anchor those in a legal entity but

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,840
I'd suggest you that the foundation

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,150
legal entity is not the most important

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,460
dimension of an open source foundation I

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,150
suggest the most important element is

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,950
actually the open source license and the

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,650
reason I say that is because the open

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,420
source license that you pick embodies

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,260
the values of the community that you're

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,370
trying to form so Jim talks

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,140
unfortunately he spoke incorrectly about

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,330
open source licenses so I'd suggest that

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,150
you don't take any notice of the

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:32,900
categorization that he gave you but that

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,680
open source licenses embody for example

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,320
the desire of a community to be free to

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,630
use code for any purpose without the

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,250
need to make an offer of source or they

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,830
embody the desire of a community to

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,710
generally expect collaboration around

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,410
the source code or they embody a desire

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,200
bar community to propagate the idea of

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,960
software freedom each of those things

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,750
lie underneath a license and as ever

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,660
moglem has said an open-source license

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,090
is the constitution of a community when

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,910
you're trying to start a community you

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,610
start with the license because the

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,770
license embodies the realities of the

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,770
community the other reason you start

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,270
with a license is because a license

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,760
indicates that source code will actually

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,160
be made available and one of the biggest

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,750
red flags for me about new open source

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,180
projects that are being announced by

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,450
corporations is often there's no source

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,980
and I've seen a couple of them starting

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,320
up recently I've gone to their website

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,330
I've gone to say to look at the source

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,070
code I can't find the source code I've

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,530
gone to look at the license I can't find

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,099
the license they're saying it's going to

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,620
be open source one day trust us come and

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,810
come and join in well when you see

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,750
projects that don't identify the license

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,700
or don't provide a clear access path to

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,150
the source code I'd suggest you that

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,090
they're not

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,860
to actually open source projects open

00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,910
source is not a badge that you wear it's

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,680
a reality that you live and so it's

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,140
something that badges itself as open

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,580
source without making a Commons freely

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,220
available is probably not the real thing

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,950
if you're going to start a community I

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,690
suggest that the place that you start in

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,180
picking your license and picking the

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,310
theme for your community is with a in

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,870
the middle of the categories of licenses

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,090
so gimmes right that there's three

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,340
categories of licenses that I would

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,610
suggest you that they are reciprocal

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,980
licenses like the GPL or the actually

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,750
the lgpl is a reciprocal license it's

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,950
not a weak copier left license and if

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,160
you treat it as one you're going to get

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:43,160
into the deep trouble trust me in the

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,640
middle there are file level reciprocal

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,320
licenses and that the at the other end

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,020
of the scale there are non-reciprocal

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,490
licenses and I'd suggest that you tend

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,680
to start in the middle of the scale when

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,640
you're designing your new community when

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
you're trying to work out what you're

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,010
going to do pick for example the Mozilla

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,980
public license version 2 and find good

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,600
reasons why you need to move either

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,490
towards the GPL or towards the apache

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,660
license which are the other two licenses

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:14,150
you should pick if you can't find an

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,730
open source license that fits the way

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,050
you want to start your community I

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,500
strongly suggest that you've got it

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,930
wrong because there are 72 I think it's

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,780
72 now there's 70 to open our lose count

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,830
either 72 open-source licenses they

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,540
express every possible combination of

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,000
motivations for a source community and

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,530
if you have got some motivation it

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,740
doesn't fit one of those it's probably

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,960
you that's wrong please do not come to

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,030
the OSI with a new license for approval

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,070
because we will ridicule you where we

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,320
won't necessarily ridicule you we might

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,690
accept your license we did just accept

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,190
two new licenses but you're going to

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:00,620
have a rough ride trust me on that open

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,360
source license is embody what are called

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,340
the four freedoms let me simplify those

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,390
four freedoms for you they are the

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,870
freedoms to you

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,450
use study improve and share the software

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,160
that's in front of you by use I mean

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,890
used for any purpose without seeking

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,050
further permission by study I mean you

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,670
have access to the full source code that

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,820
corresponds to the program that you're

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,620
using by improve I mean well make any

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,300
change and I assume you're smart enough

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,790
to make it better rather than worse and

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,590
by share I mean you can take the

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,500
original program or your improved

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,540
version and give it to anyone you wish

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,820
those four freedoms are not just an

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,860
ethical imperative they are actually the

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,810
foundation for all the value that you

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,240
and your business get from open source

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,950
software for that freedom to use the

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,380
software for any purpose means you can

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,230
have a prototype led iterative

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,120
development process where you use the

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,770
software that seems best do the thing

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,370
that seemed is best with it and then

00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,020
fail early if it turns out to be wrong

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,640
you're able to do that because it's open

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,290
source software and you haven't had to

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,570
get permission or make a commitment to

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,280
it in advance you can make a commitment

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,580
to it after you've decided to be

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,700
committed to it open source software

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,520
also allows you to change readily as a

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,560
result so that freedom to use the

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,930
software for any purpose is is not just

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,910
an ethical thought it's actually a

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,500
practical thought it's what drives your

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,510
software development and your deployment

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,460
inside the enterprise the freedom to

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,230
study the software doesn't mean you have

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,360
to study it but it does mean you can

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,090
hire experts who have studied it and

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,280
unlike with proprietary certifications

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,310
open-source experts tend to have

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,900
eclectic understandings of software so

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,370
if you hire a microsoft certified

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,890
professional they're going to know about

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,450
microsoft products but if you hire an

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,130
experienced open-source developer

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,080
they're likely to understand and know

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,000
about a wide range of software products

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,820
and they're likely to be able to allow

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,100
you to innovate and to procreate a

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,260
richer solution for your business based

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,080
on their freedom to study any of the

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,940
source code that's open source that

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,010
means you can build in-house expertise

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,140
to any level because of that freedom to

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,060
study the source code or you can of

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,160
course to hire other peoples experts by

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,080
taking a support contract it's up to you

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,410
you're free to mix and match whenever

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,100
you want to and that ability to

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,410
understand the

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,120
product intimately means that you are in

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,690
control of your architecture at all

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,600
times and those two thoughts that

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,720
ability to decide whether you hire in or

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,210
whether you outsource your support to a

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,680
company and that freedom to understand

00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,990
the product intimately and control your

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,910
architecture is the way you save money

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,260
with open source you don't save money

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,050
with open source by not paying for

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,210
licenses if that's your justification I

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,220
guarantee you will be wrong next year

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,760
when you can't save the same amount of

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,770
money instead open source leaves you in

00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,600
control of your architecture and it

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,950
leaves you in control of your budget and

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,520
that's all because of this second

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,710
freedom the freedom to study thirdly the

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,050
freedom to improve the software means

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,330
that you can participate in a rich

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,790
marketplace there's no entry fee into

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,040
open-source marketplaces anybody can

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,890
take the code and improve it or add

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,740
plugins or add-ons or distributions or

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,980
ports to new platforms and so open

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,810
source guarantees that rich marketplace

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,090
that allows you to find a solution that

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,460
fits your needs there's no barriers to

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,380
innovation created by the control of an

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,410
individual party and it means that

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,090
escrow is built in if your support

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,100
provider goes out of business somebody

00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,780
else will step in and do it you don't

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,730
have to worry about the situation where

00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,040
your proprietary vendor changes

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,920
direction or gets acquired and you're

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,780
then left high and dry with no solution

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,820
for your business and finally that

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,740
freedom to share means that you can

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,600
deploy without barriers it means you can

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,390
do cloud without having to worry about

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,400
individual product licenses it means

00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,840
that you can give it your employees and

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,180
not worried they might be using it at

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,860
home where you don't have a license it

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,020
means that you can share it with your

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,120
partner ecosystems so they can use the

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,980
same software as you so that you can

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,110
write software that develops your

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,280
partner ecosystem and not worry about

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,020
its licensing and it means that you can

00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,000
give it to citizens and customers if

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,670
you're a government organization or

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,010
contracted to a government organization

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,080
so to summarize for you the reason that

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,170
open source is so important is because

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,899
it delivers those four freedoms the

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,600
licence guarantees those four freedoms

00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,579
once you have a community together under

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,379
that licence to deliver software then

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:44,300
you can consider creating a foundation

00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:47,149
to crystallize and to sustain the

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,429
production of the software never start

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,749
with the foundation always start with

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:52,550
the license the software and the

00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,910
freedoms first and then let the

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:59,569
foundation make it permanent the truth

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,149
is that like new open-source licenses we

00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:03,920
do sometimes need a new foundation you

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,749
sometimes look at the problem and you

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,449
begin to see that in the middle of it

00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:10,819
there is something unexpected and when a

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:13,220
project is so large or so unique that it

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,379
would overwhelm an individual existing

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,660
host then it's possible that you need to

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,550
have a new project created but just like

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,619
with open-source licenses it's far

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,379
better to assume that you don't need a

00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:26,509
new one and that you should look for an

00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,740
existing one that you can use it's

00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,300
probably sitting there right in front of

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,999
your eyes and you just hadn't realized

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:37,550
it so do look more closely and you'll

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:40,939
discover it there so well why is it that

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,529
we do need foundations in a business

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:47,569
environment or look at the bottom of the

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:49,670
slights cut off so that the reason is

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,920
because corporations are corporations

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,319
and I do another tour called reptiles

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,499
which I won't do for you today where I

00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,300
compare corporations to reptiles go go

00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,949
look for the video online if you want to

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,629
see it there's a kind of version of that

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,850
from a gentleman called brown Cantrell

00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:07,010
who compares corporations to lawn mowers

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,689
and he says you should never trust a

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,970
corporation because a corporation is

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,860
just like a lawn mower it exists to make

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,990
money lawn mowers exist to cut the grass

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,640
if you put your hand in a lawnmower it

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,919
will cut your hand off that's not

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,220
because it hates you it's because it's a

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,620
lawnmower and that's the same with

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,149
corporations if you leave control of

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,490
your open source project in the hands of

00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:32,000
a corporation in the end it will screw

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,440
you and if you want to avoid that then

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,570
you need independent governance that

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,100
will stop it from happening it's just

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,049
inevitable it's just gravity it's not

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,669
because they're bad it's not because

00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:44,570
they hate you it's because they're

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:46,310
corporations and consequently the

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,870
membership of an open-source pro

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,610
which is anchored solely on a

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,940
corporation will tend to be limited

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,490
because most individual developers have

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,250
seen this story before and they would

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,350
rather not have their work and passion

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,510
converted into the under the unsure

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:06,740
about profit of somebody else so

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,110
foundations are really hard to start

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,420
from scratch I've watched quite a few

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,280
open source projects get started in

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,030
order to protect people from this bad

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,950
actor problem but it's a really hard

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,390
thing to do and it's very important that

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,910
you've worked out your community

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,770
behavior before you start your

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,810
foundation because the foundation will

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:31,070
only make your failure permanent if you

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:33,110
have failed before you start it so make

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,670
sure that you've got your the layout and

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,160
expectations of your community right

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,350
pick between whether you're going to

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,110
start a trade association or a public

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,750
benefit foundation these are two

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,730
different things it is possible to start

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,940
a trade association foundation that

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:52,940
serves public benefit Oh w2 and Eclipse

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,750
are examples but it is very easy to

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,520
start a trade association project which

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,020
does not serve the public benefit and I

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,390
won't give you examples I will need you

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,880
to leave you to go look for yourself in

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,670
the u.s. they are almost always 501 C

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,580
sixes but that does not mean that a 501

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,830
C 6 is inherently bad it simply means

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:18,110
that the extra flexibility to be bad is

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,300
in there when it comes to public benefit

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,860
corporations I have yet to see a public

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,260
benefit corporation which is is not good

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,570
it's entirely possible that it you could

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,670
create one as they become more and more

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,200
popular I expect we'll see more examples

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,640
but I generally trust a an open source

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,970
community that serves the public

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,870
interest like Apache or like in the OSI

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,160
or like the document foundation each of

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,980
those is an organization which is

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,650
committed to a public benefit and I

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,390
consequently expect them to behave in

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:58,550
the interests of every member of their

00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:00,320
community equally now one of the reasons

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,230
why trade associations

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,889
a problem is because they create a

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,019
well-understood pattern for corporations

00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:13,389
you see a trade association is kind of

00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:15,200
like a standards body it's it's a

00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,240
function which is created for the

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,669
benefit of its members and it has

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,899
complicated rules now back in the 70s

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,080
and 80s and I see there's a few other

00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:26,090
people in here who remember them as well

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,700
open standards were a novelty they were

00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,830
started out in the 70s by typically by

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,720
governments to control the monopoly of

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,389
one or two really large corporations

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,059
notably IBM and a bunch a group of

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:43,039
companies called the bunch Burroughs

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:44,720
UNIVAC NCR cray and Honeywell and open

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,370
standards were the way that governments

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,049
tried to make sure that those vendors

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,169
delivered to them something that didn't

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,570
lock them in and before long those open

00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,940
standards turned out to be something

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,470
that could be populated by the very

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,230
companies that they were trying to

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,950
control and something that's called

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,240
regulatory capture began to happen and

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,809
it turns out that if you create any

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,700
system of rules you have implicitly with

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:14,179
the system of rules created the game

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,980
that will eventually play it and the

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,570
corollary of this is when there are more

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,049
rules there are more ways to game the

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:23,690
system so you don't fix system gaming by

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,820
creating rules to prevent it because by

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,899
when you have more rules you've simply

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:33,289
created more ways to game the system so

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:36,289
today the world of standards is a pretty

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:39,019
evil space I've work I've even started a

00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:41,929
standards body it's it's a pretty wicked

00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:43,610
place to be you need a very expensive

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,149
professionals to represent your

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,580
company's needs in those communities

00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:53,149
they can arouse great passions when

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,950
they're gamed I actually even saw once a

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,580
public protest on the streets of

00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,860
copenhagen protesting against the way

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,320
that one corporation had gamed the

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,330
standard system and begging the

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,029
standards body to intervene and stop the

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,990
gaming so when it comes to a big

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,910
foundation today honestly a trade

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,510
association foundation is the ID

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,970
game surface so if you look at a large

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,970
trade association start open source

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,670
community like OpenStack for example it

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,370
has a huge board it has a huge political

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,800
playing surface and to be fully

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,530
represented there you probably need to

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,790
employ standards professionals

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,700
repurposed as open-source professionals

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,740
to go and navigate the political

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,760
intrigues that are in the organization

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,650
and so this is for me that the the core

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,140
reason why I beg you not to start more

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,240
of these things I beg you to start

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,920
organizations that focus on the code and

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,000
on the license and two separate powers a

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,700
well-structured open source foundation

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,140
has a separation of powers this is like

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,940
I don't know how many people here have

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,930
read the hitchhiker's guide to the

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,890
galaxy it's it's quite good again

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,690
certainly the people down the front have

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,040
jolly good I don't if you ever if you

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,590
remember this scene from The

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,270
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy this is

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,920
on the Go Go fringe mbark what does to

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,710
some up for you the planet of goga

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,350
Frenchman had very wisely sent all of

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,850
its intermediaries off in advance of the

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,310
rest of civilization when they were

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,260
facing a some sort of existential threat

00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,420
to their planet and so they put all the

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,070
middle management the management

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,930
consultants that telephone sanitizers

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,540
the hairdresser's all under one

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,700
spaceship to make sure the planet had

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,950
you know clean telephones when everybody

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,960
was evacuated eventually and on the a

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,310
arc that was going to leave later that

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,040
was where all the thinkers were going to

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,960
be and on the CR call the doers were

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,190
going to be on the sea arc and the B ark

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,050
went out ahead and it's worth looking at

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,880
the script for this I've got a Lincoln

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,950
if you get down low by slides as a link

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,530
in the notes to the script for this

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,180
section a well-organized open source

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:10,880
foundation is structured with Abby arc

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,130
the BR is where you send your VP of

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,930
strategy to go and negotiate with other

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,000
VPS of strategy about what's going to

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,370
happen in the project and you make sure

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,690
that that committee that whatever it is

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,240
the advisory board the board of

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,540
directors has no control whatsoever over

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,660
the engineering direction of the project

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,130
you make sure that there's a

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,780
for it engineering steering committee

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,150
that looks after the technical direction

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,280
of the project and then they can argue

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,230
about you know what the membership fee

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,580
is going to be and how the project's

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,140
going to be structured and meanwhile the

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,270
engineer's can get on with actually

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,670
making decent code in the engineering

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,590
steering committee if you look at all

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,960
the most successful open-source

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:53,010
foundations you will discover that they

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,660
are all equipped with a bee arc so that

00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,200
the management can't get in the way of

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:04,200
progress and innovation may be cruel to

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,720
call it a br Chi don't know so to be

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,580
more serious for a second some

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,620
foundations are useful how can we

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,750
identify the good ones well they they

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,130
have a number of attributes they have

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,500
the separation of powers that I've

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,910
described they have a mission which is

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,520
in the public benefit rather than

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:24,030
serving an individual corporation they

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,980
use an OSI approved license they have an

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,450
asset lock that guarantees that their

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,950
work product can only be used for the

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,870
benefit of the community that they serve

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,630
and they have some sort of

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,510
representative governance I'm very

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,890
cautious about the word meritocracy

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,480
because meritocracy normally means

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,690
government by people just like the

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,310
people who founded the organization and

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,440
I'm not sure that that's what you always

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,380
want I think you want representative

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,280
governance rather than necessarily a

00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,720
meritocracy but it's certainly an

00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,730
organization should have an elected

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,250
leadership body and membership rules

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,570
that ensure that only the current

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:06,270
contributors are the ones that get a

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:08,700
vote in electing that leadership body so

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,480
the problem I first described is is not

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,470
really that there are too many a

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,710
community interest open source

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,820
organizations the problem is is

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,670
epitomized by this slide from New York

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,290
this is this is this as you see you know

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,450
the Statue of Liberty here this is the

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,860
new jersey docks in the background you

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,380
see the doc cranes are all in the

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,360
posture of the Statue of Liberty wanting

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,890
you to believe that liberty and commerce

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,400
are the same thing just in different

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:39,510
forms and well I don't believe they are

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,430
I believe that the key to software to

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,830
open source software software freedom is

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,360
is your liberty and I believe that has

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,800
to be explicitly guaranteed and

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,210
minimizing it or mitigating it in the

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:57,840
pursuit of of Commerce always leads you

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,850
to less successful Commerce so it's very

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,850
worthwhile to make sure that you create

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,410
a body of an organization which is

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,870
anchored on that software freedom

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,550
principle firstly because the

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,560
organization will work better that way

00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,510
and secondly because the benefit that

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,590
you're trying to derive is actually

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,790
arising from the software freedom I

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,350
sometimes wonder whether we should just

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,110
stop talking about using that word

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,690
foundation altogether whether we should

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,240
find some other term to indicate a true

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,220
gathering of equals I don't know what

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,970
that word would be that would be a great

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,560
thing to discuss over lunch I think so

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,090
don't confuse liberty and commerce

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,650
they're different things that's not to

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,140
say that all community interest

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,200
organizations are perfect over even

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,450
beautiful things can get desperate even

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,950
beautiful things can fail this one was

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,000
in Amsterdam just in case you were

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,320
worried on dimeric even the best open

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,970
source project that's ever been created

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,760
which is the apache software foundation

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,530
is susceptible to gaming and has a

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,710
number of projects the result of

00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:07,680
corporations executing well funded plans

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,910
against their rules and are again over

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,310
lunch I'll tell you their their their

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:15,630
their greatest failed projects if you'd

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:18,630
like to hear about them you also need to

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:20,670
make sure that your rules are not giving

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,680
hostages to fortune you never know

00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,300
what's going to happen next you never

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,300
know what's going to drop out of the sky

00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,450
on top of you things can go seriously

00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,790
wrong if the hands that are sustaining

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,300
it change just look at Java for example

00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:38,760
which many of us thought was safe once

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,310
we put it under the GPL but turned out

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,330
to become yet another competitive attack

00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:47,940
surface in the hands of Oracle and so as

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,590
I say given any large system of rules

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,330
there's a game that's waiting to be

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,610
played so you're better off building on

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,669
the experience of others rather than to

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,739
try and invent it

00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:59,409
self if you want to create a new

00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:03,279
foundation please don't until you've

00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:05,559
been absolutely convinced that apache

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,190
software freedom can servants your spi

00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,799
or eclipse or Oh w2 can't provide you

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,350
with a home for what you want to do

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,539
because you're much safer in a proven

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,549
structure then you are in trying to

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,859
create your own when you try and create

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:22,809
your own you're a great risk of great

00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:26,049
failure and I suggest that you avoid

00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,639
that so you've decided to just ignore

00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,529
everything I've been saying for the last

00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:32,259
half hour and start a new foundation

00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:33,850
well what should you do well the number

00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:36,730
one thing you should do is make sure you

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,320
don't only talk to lawyers you should

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,169
really make sure you speak to people

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,940
who've created communities before

00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:45,100
because you have to start your design

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,080
from the perspective of the community of

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,879
developers rather than from the

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,980
perspective of the control of risk and

00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:52,269
lawyers will always start your

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,600
discussion from the perspective of

00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:57,429
control of risk so go to them to control

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,379
the risks that arise from your choice of

00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:01,679
a structure for the foundation rather

00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:04,230
than asking them to design it for you

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,179
secondly put software freedom first

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,159
software freedom is not just the FSF

00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,659
spray-z ideology this is the president

00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,850
of OSI telling you though their former

00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:15,669
prisoners I tell you this that software

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,169
freedom is key it's where all the

00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,450
business benefit that you're pursuing

00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:21,519
comes from so start from there in your

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,460
design don't start from some business

00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,289
plan start from software freedom

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,929
equality is everything don't create an

00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:31,119
uneven playing field a voyage for

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:33,100
example contribute contribute early

00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,649
since agreements try and use license in

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,779
license out avoid anything that gives

00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,820
one party in the community rights that

00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:41,619
the others don't have because if you do

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,600
that you will restrict the number of

00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:45,460
people who participate and you will also

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,669
create a hostage to fortune for the

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,649
future and then transparency is

00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,840
everything as well make sure that anyone

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,639
knew coming into the community can find

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,679
out what happened before and the reason

00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:59,169
that things are as they are the great

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,519
benefit of Apache is they have a rule

00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,849
that says that if it didn't happen on

00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,869
the mailing list it didn't happen and

00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:06,940
okay so you don't want to mailing lists

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,230
so use a forum or use something else but

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,780
make sure that your decision

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,570
tree is always visible to everybody who

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,640
comes into the organization plan

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,590
conflict resolution in advance have a

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,210
code of conduct have a group of people

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,010
with consensus about what the code of

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,200
conduct is going to be and how it's

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,669
going to operate there's no point trying

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,940
to put together your code of conduct

00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:30,130
once the fight has started get

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,480
everything that you're doing in writing

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:36,970
and don't rely on verbal agreements

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,490
between people and finally incorporate

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,049
wisely pick a really good destination to

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,000
incorporate at the moment I'm

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,250
recommending people come to the UK and

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,590
start Community Interest companies but

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,720
think very carefully about where you're

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,429
going to incorporate you'll find that if

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,080
you've got American members to your

00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:57,280
community they will suggest that you

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,690
become a 501 C 3 in Delaware and the

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,429
reason they'll suggest that to you is

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,760
because of the tax benefits to American

00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:05,230
corporations but I'm not convinced that

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,830
that's the right answer for everybody

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,809
and see above as well so enough

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,490
foundations already I think we've got

00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:14,320
enough of them I don't want any more if

00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,530
you're going to have to make one well

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,620
you know so be it you know what doesn't

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:23,230
kill us makes us stronger but really it

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,929
would be best if you didn't create any

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,679
more thank you very much for your time

00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,679
