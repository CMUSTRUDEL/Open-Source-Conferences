right so as Cedric has been mentioned as

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,390
been mentioning earlier Oh w2 has been

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,300
working on an app store marketplace for

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,369
the past few years at least in thought

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,140
so so the idea of this presentation is

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,960
to give you more of a preview what it

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,309
could look like and so what so I'm by

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,600
the way I'm Alex Lovell from now you

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,420
sure soft and and so so what's the

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,329
what's the idea that at least I for my

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,309
point of view that we can see behind a

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,770
marketplace more from a technical point

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,750
of view rather than from a business

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,930
point of view which cedric elaborated on

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,969
so the whole idea is that w two projects

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,039
as our today's they're very good at

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,719
making the source code available I mean

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,570
that's one of the one of the key points

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,820
of what or w2 is about they usually

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,060
provide documentation for end users

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,650
which includes installation instructions

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,409
however there's a number of things that

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,229
could be improved the first one is the

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,770
way the adobe two projects are promoted

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,259
are made available to people to use from

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,810
the promotion point of view the

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,270
marketing point of view and also what

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,369
what we found is or what you can find if

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,049
you try to use some of the other way to

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,720
projects is that sometimes it's not very

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,100
easy to install okay although youtube

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,290
projects are all about middleware

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,689
sometimes its technical sometimes it's

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,380
hard to actually install and make work

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,689
so what would what we'd like to do with

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,990
the or w-2 marketplace is give the

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,570
projects a set of tools to allow them to

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,329
package pre-configured version of their

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,600
of their software so that the users can

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,600
easily out of the box use this order you

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,450
to project that would include the the

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,890
project software configuration of course

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,099
you can find them in the documentation

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,979
some some other lw2 software are eased

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,760
more easily install than others for some

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,909
of them

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,739
you have to follow more or less like the

00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,620
pieces of instructions so the whole idea

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,739
is that you could provide a

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,549
pre-configured pre-installed

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,769
installation of your order will to

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,900
project and installations because you

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,150
may want to provide different flavors or

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,739
different types of installations for

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,799
your w-2 project so in the past we had

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,620
started when I was a LW too and then

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,019
with you sigh soft as well to provide or

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,690
w-2 project with the possibility to use

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,609
such tools on the user soft online

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,989
products but many projects have used it

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,500
so there's a web page on the other way

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,519
to website which describes and helps

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,730
projects find out how they could do it

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,819
we've had as far as I believe three

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,889
projects we've done it this is web lab

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,310
is one of them silver piece is another

00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,620
one and I even forget what the other one

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,420
is so as that hasn't been very

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,579
successful so the whole idea of the

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,519
marketplace and why I'm talking about it

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,799
today is to promote this this this

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,680
technology a bit more and to show you

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,109
what it could look like so what what it

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,060
is for projects it's it's a toolkit

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,400
which will allow you to build a

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,690
deployable version of your w-2 projects

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,970
you will be able to choose the operating

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,760
system on which you build what we call

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,599
the template you'll be able to expose it

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,090
to the marketplace with the sexy types

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,250
of information screenshots and things

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,209
that will look like it's really

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,980
something promoted on an app store and

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,859
for the end uses what it will do is it

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,139
will enable them to generate an machine

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,299
image whether it's a cloud image of

00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,180
virtual image or an ISO which includes

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:05,699
your w-2 project software prepackaged

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,519
pre configured and ready to run so I'm

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,699
going to show you a little video because

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,489
apparently the had problems plugging the

00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,010
computer so did the video first so it's

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,409
based on a space on spy go bi as an

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,650
example so why Spago bi well because

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:24,510
Cedric's said you spy go bhai I don't

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,930
have done a previous example with hammer

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,870
which

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,900
is another ability to project spyker bi

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,000
is not a better or worse candidate for

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,850
for this it's actually fairly well

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,720
packaged so it was easy or easier for me

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,669
to actually build the whole demo it

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,410
would apply to most auto body two

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,300
projects maybe not those which are

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,449
software components that you embed in

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,840
larger pieces of code but most of w-2

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,690
projects could be a candidate I also

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,850
investigated with Bruno Dylan singer the

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,320
cliff projects because cliff is typical

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,090
of a project where you could provide

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
different types of installations so that

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,169
would also be a good candidate I also

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,699
looked at Doku but most notable YouTube

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,750
projects would be in the same position

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:12,300
so the steps let's just go to the demo

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,280
so there's going to be several steps to

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,259
upload the software to create what we

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,750
call the template to expose it in the

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,940
marketplace and to generate an image so

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,009
how do you how do you do so basically

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,020
what I did is I needed to create

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,300
something to install Spago bi so I just

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,900
went to the documentation of the spider

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,020
web site and i found that you needed to

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,479
download something called the old in one

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,500
package so that's what i did you also

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:44,699
needed to find a number of other things

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,130
like this some it tells you how to start

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,159
it and it tells you that you have to do

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,919
something with the jvm for the memory

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:56,759
and so i just decided to go on so what I

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,919
did is I went to so this is using this

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,310
is using the tool kit that we provide to

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,840
the app hug project so the marketplace

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,460
will be based on the same product so

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,080
basically here you have a space where

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,750
you can build your own templates and

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,479
upload your software so here I'm in a

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,490
min the software library and I've got a

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:20,849
spa go speco all-in-one software

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,180
software bundle and i also have software

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:26,190
bundle for the java 17 which was

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,409
required to install spackle so which is

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,590
basically the RPM which will self

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,510
install in the in the template and I've

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,880
got the other one which is by go bi

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,860
all-in-one itself which is basically the

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,379
big zip file

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,750
paintings by Kobe oil in one and another

00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,780
little file here which is the set

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,879
classpath so basically when I try to do

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,439
the template I bumped into the out of

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,229
memory error that's mentioned on the

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,729
installation I looked in some forums on

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,699
spy goggles were very helpful and I

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:59,060
found a way to actually put this this

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,580
the Java heap size instruction at the

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,099
right place so it happens to be in a in

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,409
a file called self class path that

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,270
that's going to be used so then the next

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,400
step is to correctly create a template

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,229
so when when we create when we allow you

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,090
to create a template we give you a

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,099
choice of a poor operating systems so we

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,870
support here the major linux one we also

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,430
support windows will have to decide

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,529
whether w to whether the audible to

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,340
marketplace wants to help windows and

00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:29,569
for each of the OS we offer the various

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:32,960
architectures so now i'm just going to

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:37,460
skip forward I've created that spa go bi

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,789
template based on Santos and a template

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,589
is made of what we call a stack so in

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,589
the stack you've got the OS profile

00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:48,610
packages so that's cos packages that you

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:51,710
want to put in the stack you can decide

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,659
to so here I've just got the minimum

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,330
always packages you can search for any

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,490
time of package that you'd like to add

00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,870
if you need them so that's because you

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,440
know that your project needs I don't

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,020
know for example lip curl here and the

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,039
other part is the software itself so

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,839
that's where you have here at the bottom

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,960
you've got the software that I need to

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:18,409
run Spago bi so I've got my sorriness

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,500
skipped forward so in the software that

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,569
I had I needed the Java 17 I'd in its

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,550
pago and you need also need installation

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,860
boot script so installation boo scripts

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,629
is where you're actually going to do the

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,899
installation so that's typically what

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:36,560
you need to run and if we have a look at

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:39,500
what the spa go configure scripters so

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,019
basically it doesn't doesn't do very

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,909
much it just unzipped the zip file of

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,209
the spy go all in one which I hand

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:51,189
uploaded

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:54,699
so tells me to use Java wondered 7 and

00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:57,009
then it exports also the variable for

00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,499
openoffice which I need to do so i found

00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:02,829
that later on when i try to to run it

00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:05,019
and it takes my set classpath file which

00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:07,869
contains the the java parameters and

00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,720
puts it at the right place which is in

00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:13,389
the opt Spago bi installation so that's

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,579
basically what it does couple chmod plus

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,619
X which I found that I needed and to

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,290
start by Kobe I it's another script and

00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:23,379
this other script basically runs the two

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,360
commands to start it and that's it I'm

00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,149
done so what I need to do now is I need

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,069
to generate an image to test ina so

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:36,069
that's what I did and when you generate

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:39,279
an image the the tool offers a wide

00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:42,069
range of choice for cloud formats for

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,329
virtual formats and also if you have if

00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:45,550
you happen to have a physical machine

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,399
for an iso so you choose which format

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,649
you need so in our case what i did is i

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,319
generated an OpenStack image and you can

00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,679
publish that image to a cloud of your

00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:58,449
choice so in my place in my account I

00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,730
have a notable you to stack account

00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,860
where I give the end points for being

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,079
able to publish to the OpenStack gotta

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,720
go to stack infrastructure so that's

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:11,410
what I did and so let's let's have a

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,600
look now on my OpenStack of the route to

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,459
stack account so you can see the image

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,929
Spago hole in one which I had uploaded

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:23,379
and here I have launched an instance of

00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:26,889
this and this is the URL so if I go to

00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,319
this to this machine that's running that

00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:34,019
contains pago bi I see Spago bi here and

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:37,899
if I log in with the default bi admin

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:40,389
user so what happens is i can see

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:44,079
welcome to Spago bhai so here we go so

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,119
that it means that you have here a full

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,949
template containing spike OPI all-in-one

00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:51,699
all the installation instructions and

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:54,129
the end user can simply generate the

00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,959
format of that choice so I did OpenStack

00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,910
here but I could do another format and

00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,510
now let's have a look at what it looks

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,640
like in the marketplace so

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,360
the marketplace which can be seen as a

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,030
catalogue of templates you you have here

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,380
more marketing type of information so i

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,080
will not go through the full features

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,740
but typical things you can do is you can

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,780
add screenshots it's all updateable

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,330
using the markup language so you can put

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,420
some text I put I've added some links

00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,830
here you can put links to resources

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,020
there's also features tab where you can

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,410
put text so I just copy this simple one

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,800
but you can be more verbis you can put

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,810
reviews in terms of pricing these are on

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,810
the open source at this stage in terms

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,520
of support you can add information and

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,440
in terms of installation instruction you

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:47,510
just explain what you do to run this

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,100
template so basically basically that's

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,180
it for the preview of the marketplace so

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:56,930
the whole idea again is to the whole

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,630
idea of this is really too unable or

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:03,050
double youtube on the right slides below

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:08,930
mine it's really to enable the

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:11,120
audibility project to be able to to be

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,630
able to bundle their software to be able

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,910
to make it easier for end users to use

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,770
it because sometimes the installation

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,250
instructions are a bit complicated so

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:24,470
it's really to allow end-users to more

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,360
easily adopt to software by providing a

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,820
prepackaged version of it and you can

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,890
imagine different flavors of spy go bi

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,330
here I did the olean one but you may

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,070
want to produce several templates for

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,420
the different different types of

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,870
installations different types of

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,770
databases different types of any

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,070
components so you could have different

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,020
flavors exposed in that marketplace so

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,090
basically that's the that's what I

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,850
wanted to show you i hope haven't been

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,850
too long so thank you

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,290
