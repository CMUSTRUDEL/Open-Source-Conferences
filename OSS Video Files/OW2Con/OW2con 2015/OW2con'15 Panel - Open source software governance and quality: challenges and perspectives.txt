and so I'm not going to introduce Simon

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,870
for the round table I'm going to

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,230
introduce our next one of our

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,300
distinguished panelists so on this wish

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,000
pathways is a well-known free software

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,580
developer and former three-time debian

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,699
project leader is currently researcher

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,660
in applied formal method at ariel and

00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,359
associate professor of computer science

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,189
at the university parodied role he's

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,850
also a board member of the open-source

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:39,030
software open source initiative and he's

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,860
also the recipient of the o'reilly

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:51,480
open-source award in 2015 please welcome

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:57,149
stefano securely and our third panelist

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,160
is where is a British national he'll be

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,010
there there is it is a British natural

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,870
based in France he enjoys being at the

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,909
boundary between business and technology

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,470
so we mixes these skills and with dr

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,990
years in the telecommunication industry

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,840
and extensive international exposure is

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,450
currently head of open-source governance

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:28,439
at orange please welcome Christian

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:33,450
Patterson so I'm going to sit with them

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,869
and try to see what they have to tell us

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,930
that open source governments and I'm not

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,200
going to start with Simon's just had the

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:46,020
floor for a half an hour how I will

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,840
leave sometime photo for them for

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,149
questions from the audience and I will

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,090
start first with the other panelist

00:01:51,149 --> 00:02:00,259
witches had two keynote presentations

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:04,469
one virtual one real and actually from

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:10,619
your perspective Christian any feedback

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:13,150
any comment on those presentations as

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,829
you can tell not everything was prepared

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:21,909
a surprise question um I think it's it's

00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:25,480
a great interest to me the division has

00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:31,629
been presented around the aspects of

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,609
community I think open so open source is

00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,769
really important not because of the

00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:37,689
economic benefits or efficiencies that

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,180
can be driven from come up from open

00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:41,799
source but through the innovations that

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,010
can be created by bringing people

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,530
together so I very much appreciate the

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,049
the discourse that is more focused on

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,230
think of in thinking of the community

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:55,629
and how the community can bring people

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,359
together to drive that innovation rather

00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,920
than thinking of the legal aspects to

00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,159
control risk obviously we have the

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,939
control risk and the legal side that's

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:10,780
an evidence but using open source as a

00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:13,599
as a as a fundamental to sharing and

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,349
discussion for me that's really where

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,049
the benefits of open source line it's

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,669
definitely your come on yeah so I was

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,769
telling someone that he managed to stall

00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,000
most of my comments so i guess it shows

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,739
that you came from very similar

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,480
organization or the same organization

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,790
but so i went to i light something with

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,159
simon mention in passing but i think

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,230
it's very important it's it's about the

00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,209
possibility of gaming the system so

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,340
you're very much agree that one of the

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,319
key functions of a foundation actually

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,930
being an asset block but there is a very

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,489
specific asset which is copyright which

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,739
is very important because it has the

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,329
potential of subverting the basic

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,949
governance of your project and basically

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,019
subverting the Constitution of your

00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:56,019
project at depth as Simon said quoting

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,790
I've been mulling so basically if you

00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,769
need to be very careful in the governor

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,069
for off of your project if you allow

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,269
someone to have some sort of mandatory

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,129
copyright assignment agreement or

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,780
copyright license agreement required to

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,060
be able to participate to contribute to

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,949
your project if you do allow that to any

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,540
part even if it is a foundation you're

00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:16,659
basically changing the playing field

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,310
which is no longer balanced so it is not

00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,019
necessarily bad to have copyright

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,029
assignment agreements or CLA to a

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,680
specific foundation or specific no

00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,690
profit for instance but it pushes the

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,270
barrier for the kind of requirements you

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,220
have on

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,560
transparency on other the organization

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,259
now the organization is run much higher

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,370
so this is a very important point to pay

00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,139
attention to because it has the

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,729
potential of undermining everything else

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,340
even if you have everything else at

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:45,500
Simon said is very useful requirements

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,690
for organizations Simon you don't have a

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,639
comment on your own presentation I quite

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,129
enjoyed it oh good yeah that was that

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,830
was goose visitation it did yes pretty

00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,360
good thank you actually we have two

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,340
perspectives here we have the

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,949
perspective of the user I know orange is

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,259
a big user and also strong contributor

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,530
but I would see you Christian hear more

00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,259
from the user perspective I assume that

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,750
as head of orbitals governance at Orange

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:14,690
you did more from the user perspective

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,210
and how a big organization can integrate

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,789
open source into its own information

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,750
systems or in own assets of technologies

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,909
that right for sure I think orange has

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,979
traditionally been viewed as more a

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:30,830
consumer of open source but that's

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:33,530
changing is progressively changing and

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,500
we're progressively now participating in

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,139
an active fashion to a number of

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,699
different initiatives such as OPN Fe for

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:47,029
example so I think a lot of

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,469
telecommunication companies would be in

00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,630
the same position as of our ranges

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:53,000
traditionally starting out as users of

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,770
open source and are now starting to see

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,409
the benefits we're open source is

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,930
playing a more increasingly significant

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,930
role in the fundamentals of today's

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,050
communication for example network

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:09,490
management and orchestration or cloud

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,590
infrastructures for example so I

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,740
governance from an orange perspective

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,219
has been more focused on usage but is

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,919
increasingly focused on participation

00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:24,680
and community building ok she's a good

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,380
example of consumer becoming more and

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,440
more contributor but seems to me that

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,020
Simon 70 were defending more the

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,169
perspective of the technology provider

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,110
so you are a developer as a developer

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,160
you organize yourself as a one

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,140
individual into

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,390
nation or meeting people foundation or

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,280
community or losing couples group of

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,100
developers and then you have to find

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,140
your own governance because it's not you

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,450
have to project something to the rest of

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,480
the market and be able to communicate

00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:00,460
with the rest with those that are not in

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,430
your team and from my perspective

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,500
governance is what makes you predictable

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,560
but help people contribute in showing

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,090
you what so what do you think of this

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,730
pursue perspective on this the first

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,340
thing I'd say is that actually user is

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,290
the most important role in open source

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,200
no one joins an open source project to

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,850
develop it almost everybody who joins an

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,850
open source project joins it because

00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:28,340
they use it and they may use it it may

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,250
be that it's a a component technology

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,170
and they are a developer who uses that

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,210
component technology in their work it

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,490
may be that their employer has created

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,170
this technology that they use in their

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,240
business and has now made it open source

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,920
but it's desperately rare for somebody

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,360
to join a project simply because they

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,760
want to develop it they almost always

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,980
start as a user and that's why user

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,350
rights are actually your first priority

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,760
is to make sure that the that's where

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,950
software freedom is so important because

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,740
the very first freedom is the freedom to

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,600
use the software for any purpose I think

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,150
that a community actually builds itself

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,300
pretty easily once you have got a group

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,530
of users who want to co-develop together

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,230
because you'll find that they there are

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,060
they coming from a particular context so

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,680
there maybe they're coming from Agra new

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,650
project they'll come with an expectation

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,419
of the GPL or they'll come from an

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,840
Apache project with an expectation of

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:23,780
the apache license they're also fairly

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,250
easily understand how they are going to

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,350
maintain their independence from each

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,030
other as they collaborate and that will

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,350
also be an anchor for the governance so

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,469
I definitely don't think it's as hard as

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,789
you think it is to to create governance

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,140
I don't think you create governments

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,419
where developers I think you create

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,370
governance for users who end up as

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,360
co-developers and it's this is exactly

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,500
where Oren you know I could have

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,090
predicted what was going to happen with

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,970
orange they using lots of open source

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,460
sooner or later they start developing

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,020
internally and they discover that having

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,760
created folks or

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,470
projects there were their effort in

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,870
keeping maintaining their code is too

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,310
great the wise up to the fact that

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,830
contributing back reduces their

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,870
development costs and they overcome the

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,670
legal burden that with all their legal

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,100
counsel telling them not to contribute

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,320
because it's so dangerous and they start

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,670
contributing and they become members of

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,940
the community because they were users

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,770
first I think that's what always happens

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,170
but from the TV and perspective Stefano

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,310
can you just give us a couple of

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,340
highlights of on governance of this I

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,930
mean it's a great project obviously sure

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,900
so first of all I it's doesn't agree

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,850
that basically what I said is that using

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,070
is a gateway drug to developing software

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,230
software and that's absolutely true so

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,440
in my experience from debian but more

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,750
generally with all large free software

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,340
projects i would say that governance is

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,740
actually a very important marketing

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,650
point of your project so i would say

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,570
that we are past very naive use of open

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,730
source so people no longer use opens was

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,290
only believing that it's free so it's

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,910
going to be cheap for me more cheap than

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,160
using proprietary software it was a

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,020
presentation of one of the benefit of

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
free software which was acceptable like

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,310
10 years ago 15 years ago but we are no

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,990
longer there hopefully and so what's

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,470
important for me is that all kind of

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,780
large users of free software usually

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,280
know that to be able to rely on some

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,710
specific software they should be able to

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,690
influence where the software is going so

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,190
they should be able if they want to not

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,110
they are obliged to but if they want to

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,090
they should be able to have an impact on

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,800
the technical choices that are made in

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,230
the project via their their own

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,330
contributions so I think these days if

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,070
you see a software project you are

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,500
depending on someone which is tightly

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,960
controlled by a very single very

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,520
specific entity which have potentially

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,890
commercial interests which are opposed

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,780
to yours you are maybe having less of a

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,520
reason for choosing that product in a

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,140
position to other products on the other

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,850
hand if you believe that you couldn't

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,980
pick you you can put some engineering

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,660
time on that project and affect the

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,490
direction where that project is going

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,990
following the governor soul which

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,750
hopefully put everyone on the same level

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,660
then you have extra reason for choosing

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,370
that product over a competing product so

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,310
in that reason I think for the point of

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,230
view of user

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,870
an important key decision point whether

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,970
T there is some fair governance whatever

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,210
that means in a given project which is

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,100
both actual and perceived and if you are

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,830
software producer you have an interest

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,750
in giving everyone the actual feeling

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,310
that you do welfare governor's that

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,650
allows everyone to contribute to your

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,450
project I think that's one of the very

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,270
appreciated point about Debian project

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,070
but more generally about all filter

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,720
project of their with good and

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:35,640
perceivably good governance Christine I

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,020
I agree with the comments the coming out

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,150
I think one of the interests from

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,580
industry one of the challenges for open

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,370
source towards industry is putting in

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,120
place that governance but not putting it

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,850
in place purely for a point of

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,820
transparency today but also to allow a

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:57,360
certain visibility what's coming up in

00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,000
the future to allow the participants to

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,040
join in to the direction of the roadmap

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
which is an interesting balance because

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,480
if an open source project has been

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,570
initiated by a company for for whatever

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,750
reason how does the direction of the

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,550
community then take the project but does

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,550
it still answer to what the original

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,089
demands on that project were the

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,950
original creating drivers for the

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,440
project so that's an interesting balance

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,570
but the other side is obviously projects

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,089
coming along as n yes but can we trust

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,430
the road map of the project will it

00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,650
still be here tomorrow or will it change

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,720
direction of course there are answers

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,940
for open source there where we r is open

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,220
source so anyone can take a fork but

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,380
it's still a legitimate question and

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,380
then I see too many open source projects

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,140
today which don't yet have a visibility

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,820
for what the roadmap is in the future

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:57,270
and I think that's still a break Simon

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,040
you chose not to create new foundations

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,930
and then you ended up giving you the

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,940
recipes to create acceptable new

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,300
foundations that's because people in

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,400
ever to be doing bad full of hope that

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,290
there's an inverse psychology is crazy

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,360
at all not to do that so people we

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,180
wanted a yet people just saying it's

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,460
badly media

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,140
make people rush the under video eat

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,510
less cookies but here's a recipe if you

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,180
want too easy yeah his recipe for sure

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,030
the free cookies yeah fine then having

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,160
us given us the recipe you did start

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,410
with the idea of the license being

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:34,180
paramount and being the starting point

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,290
at the software freedom fine but I

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,940
understand from what you've been saying

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,640
that govern is not just about license

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,560
but it's and I would this personally

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,290
define governance and the way we try to

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,960
apply it WI sir like a social construct

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,430
a set of rules and how decisions are

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,930
made who are the roles what are the

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,050
organizations you did mention the

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,540
separations of powers etc so in your

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,080
view what after licenses and software

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,880
freedom what would be the single most

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,160
important elements or component of a

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,300
government systems that you would like

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,770
to see or that would concur to a

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,500
successful acceptable governance system

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:14,320
ok but I'm just emphasized that I still

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,740
believe that the license is key because

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,750
everything else you do is transient but

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,640
the licenses is the only way that you're

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,130
allowed to use the copyright forever so

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,990
when the rules change the only thing

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,280
that doesn't change is the freedoms

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,560
you've been given under the license is

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,300
that having said that we need a lengthy

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,680
defines the rules of the game and what

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,870
you can do with over the software do you

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,670
having said that behind that you needed

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,260
a little bit more support beyond the

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,300
license to meet all community like they

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,730
live and that's where other another

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,350
layer of governance is so that the next

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,340
most important thing I think is making

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,730
sure that your governance is

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,910
representative of your contributors so a

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,950
great mode of failure for I won't tell

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,630
you which witch open source project it

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,130
is but there's an open source project or

00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,630
please that though another you have to

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,310
work it out there's an open source

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,040
project that that makes sure that it's

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,190
it's official members never lose that

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,650
official member status and can always

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:12,130
vote down things that novelties that

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,320
come up with their successes and they

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,060
debt that organization desperately needs

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,470
to have limited membership so that

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,480
you're only a member while you're

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,370
contributing and the reason for that is

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,380
because it's the most important aspect

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,590
of an open source community is to have

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:33,450
its leadership elected by its current

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:35,860
rydges representativeness of

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,830
contributors in the community that would

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,660
be Christian do you what single

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,610
components of Governors would you pick

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,390
up the same one or could you highlight

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,980
another one I think the the same one

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,740
although you're coming from governance

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,540
as from a viewpoint of provider

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,860
obviously I think orange as you've

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,130
already mentioned that also has the

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,110
viewpoint of the user so it's

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,030
representative we have our governance

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,970
which is in place which is as close as

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:08,020
it can be to the developers who use the

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:10,480
applications or solutions I think one of

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,540
the key components which is across the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,520
board is good communication making sure

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,410
and I think this was brought on in your

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,350
slides as well making sure that what

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,570
you've decided and communicated is

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,120
clearly visible to everyone including

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,040
the reasoning behind and the chain of

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,960
events leading up to our communication

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,280
be transparent and open being

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:36,130
transparent and being promoting the use

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,370
and the policies around the open source

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,620
so communication okay Stefano you can

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:45,370
infer that gnome is very more and more

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,530
difficult to do so what the government's

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,540
best breakfast you would single out so I

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,250
would have said but someone use a better

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,990
expression so and the way I put it was

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,610
having technical people in debt in

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,290
charge of technical decisions but I

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,230
think separation of powers actually a

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,450
more clear way of framing that and so

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,920
basically see governance as a two-level

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,120
thing so basically you have technical

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,190
governance and we have political

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,050
governance so technical governance is

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,900
you decide which lines of code get

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,120
accepted when which are not and and also

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,890
how do you solve conflicts so at some

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,480
point you will have in a large enough

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,770
technical community people that get it

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,270
conflicts because they want the project

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,030
to go in opposite and incompatible

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,470
directions and you need ways to

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,110
arbitrate who is right and who is wrong

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,640
can be benevolent dictator can be other

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,560
ways but you need a way to arbitrate

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,450
those conflicts and political governance

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,910
is a kind of a meta level or if you want

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,680
an i or 11 on top of that it's just

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,929
basically stuff like you decide who

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,580
decides

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,940
who decide who's in charge of technical

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,610
decisions and the two must be kind of

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,379
separate as well as you can and you need

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,940
accountability which is thing which is

00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,889
basically thing what you just said so

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,779
when there are technical decision you

00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:54,119
might find people that don't like it

00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,610
okay that's fine but you need to have

00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,619
accountability on out that decision has

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,539
been reached and the accountability

00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,700
should be something that is felt by the

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:05,070
community first of all by contributors

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,539
and also by potential users because if

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,240
you don't have that you immediately

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,159
start thinking about as this technical

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,809
decision being raked in some way has

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,299
there been some political maneuvering to

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:18,330
get into that specifically situation and

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:22,830
that will inevitably push away potential

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,519
contributors and even potential users so

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,549
we claim to be to that repository having

00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,230
having an open source license and being

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:33,779
another princess repository one of those

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,999
are we not mentioned it's not enough for

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,710
being in a bunch of project we claim

00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:39,179
that the real princess project has to be

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,879
complemented by governance and you just

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,230
proven that it's more than just the

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:47,759
open-source license so thank you for

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:50,669
that now we n because of these penalties

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,619
about governance and to help us better

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:57,210
foundation you understand that okay we

00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:59,279
use we picking your brain is dominant I

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,369
mean I mean it's one thing that the

00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,830
tools you use determines what you do I'm

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:08,820
you're the game the double teaming the

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,059
game or how you became the rules we have

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,100
also have this idea that the the the

00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,509
infrastructure the Technic platform also

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,190
helps determine the kind of social

00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,320
structure or the social organization

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,480
they go they go the long and the

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,899
questions we where we wondering is how

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,590
can we embed the governance or into the

00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,730
infrastructure or is infrastructure a

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,340
constraint on this type of governance

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,830
you have or can you automate governance

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,389
can we have something that can be I mean

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,549
we're stretching resources but if we had

00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,230
a tool or a website something with lots

00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,909
of automation and governance could be

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,429
fully automated and all the project

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:46,919
could be you know taken from equation 2

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:50,640
mature automatically I think we could go

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,770
fishing but what's all the tools

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,300
Archy in terms of implementing

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,310
governance and what can be the dangerous

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,320
who wants to take this one my turn to go

00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:05,610
first I over will steal all your

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,050
comments so I don't regarding technical

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,610
governance of course you have plenty of

00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,260
tools that have a direct impact on

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,150
software quality which I think was also

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,830
one of the other question we we were

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,600
considering here but forgetting

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,490
political governance I don't think you

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,020
have much tools that will help so you

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,060
sure you have the basic tools for

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,750
accountability so having report periodic

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,980
reports requiring that every single

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,320
attraction which is paid and foundation

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,600
money as a companion bio report is just

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,370
a great idea having IRC logs where

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,380
important technical issues are made are

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,970
very important and a basic

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,920
accountability tools but are nothing

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,410
fancy so it's something that we were

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,960
using also outside foundations and

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,940
that's outside of open-source context on

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,280
the other hand the technical tools we

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,430
use to do development for instance

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,430
forges github or specifically git log a

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,990
great way to get insights on whether the

00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,660
governance for project is good or not

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,520
for instance there are more and more

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,800
tools that companies the companies the

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,300
foundation used to show where they

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,580
contribute the technical contribution to

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,750
a given projects come from so if you see

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,190
that eighty percent of the take a

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,480
contribution or ninety percent of the

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,550
take a contribution to a given project

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,160
come from single company even if on

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,170
paper that project is governed by a very

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,600
fair governance structure they are not

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,970
delivering on being a leveling playing

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,500
field if you see the contribution come

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,270
from a wide variety of different

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,040
companies or even different contributors

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,200
paid by different entity driven

00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,480
volunteers then you have a much better

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,740
feeling on the fact that the governance

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,330
of this project is prolly doing

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,730
something right so what you saying is

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,530
measuring the project and I'm sure CTO

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,480
would be very interested in that that

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,190
measuring the project is something that

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,530
can really help improve the governance

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,630
I'm so I don't know if it helps in

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,670
improving it but I think it's great in

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,070
showing the current status of the

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,510
governance and actually what the

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,390
governance of that project is actually

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,600
delivering I think gotta be very careful

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,950
with that because so that one of the

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,460
good things that OpenStack has been

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,059
doing is they've had bitter geo

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,360
implementing adaptable

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,669
for them giving statistics and I think

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,730
that's done a fine job in the OpenStack

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,019
community of helping them to understand

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,879
what their strengths and weaknesses are

00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,070
so I think for your political governance

00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:20,490
I think having an analytic dashboard is

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,710
a very valuable thing I think when it

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,720
comes to your your developer governance

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,370
um it depends on how good your

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,149
developing governance ears as to whether

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,070
you can automate it so there's a lot of

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:35,269
people who use github as their

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,029
repository and github imposes on you a

00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:41,100
governance which is the poor request

00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:44,009
it's it so I actually call it get

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,019
governance it's it's you decide you're

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:48,389
going to put your code into github and

00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:49,350
from then onwards all collaboration is

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:51,950
going to be cut is going to be

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,629
asynchronous through an issues log and

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,850
expressed through pull requests unless

00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:59,730
you very actively and energetically do

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,619
something different and then there are

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,330
points in that workflow where you can

00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,309
insert further governance tools so there

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,129
are plugins to check that people have

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,230
made deseos or sign contributor

00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:12,570
agreements there are plugins to check

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,480
that the project still builds after the

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,669
after the pull request is integrated so

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,340
you can do those sorts of things if your

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,990
if your governance methodology is really

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,070
complicated you don't stand a chance of

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:29,369
embodiment in a tool I if you have lots

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,259
of human opinions that you need to

00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,820
gather you might be able to create some

00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,409
workflow tool that will gather them but

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,639
fundamentally a really complex

00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:38,490
governance I don't think you can

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:40,590
automate but so I'd say metrics for your

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,869
political governance i would say that

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,179
yes if you've got an elegant technical

00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,549
governance you can automate it and try

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,740
to keep going simple so as to avoid the

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,210
rules that with all the dark corners in

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,279
there the governance elegance is your

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,129
friend because elegant systems are hard

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,789
to gain so when all conflicts been

00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:02,399
resolved by consensus consensus is a

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:05,700
very powerful tool but again learn from

00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:08,070
apache here in apache to block consensus

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,429
you have to but if you minus one in

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,720
apache that is implicit use implicitly

00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,310
you saying that you're willing to solve

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,470
the problem you've identified

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,970
and that's a strength and a weakness of

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,650
a package governance it means that no

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,810
one will step in when it's really really

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,670
bad but it means that in a fully

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,880
committed project people will only block

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:30,080
when they're willing to come to correct

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,420
so question when you hear this as a user

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,690
becoming increasingly a contributor into

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:41,090
this big projects or global project what

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:43,740
do you look for I think the number one

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,070
factor of joining into these communities

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,010
from a contributor perspective is the

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,610
level playing field to ensure that

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:56,790
community is not being driven by a

00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:59,150
single company or entity as you

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:03,540
mentioned so having some visibility on

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:06,630
basic statistics basic API of courses of

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:09,030
interest so level playing field and the

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,780
ability to come in without major

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:15,380
restrictions so that you can participate

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,720
early quickly and without complexity

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,330
very important obviously thank you very

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,260
much I think we have five minutes I

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,750
think we should put the logos of our

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,510
sponsors on the screen please because

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,800
these list of speakers is black okay

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,940
it's been bothering me since the

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,550
beginning and I'm from everyone so let's

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,180
put our logos on on screen please you

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:46,320
know okay we have few minutes for

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,600
questions from the audience and think I

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,110
have a crew from here that can I can

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:57,990
pass please please introduce yourself

00:25:52,110 --> 00:26:00,750
and ask your question in English ok

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,560
Gabriela fatty during a groper probably

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:07,440
some some people knows about me ok I

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,720
understand that quality governance is

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,620
key for open source I understand also

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,690
that users is the most important role

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:22,310
then developers actually and but we have

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:25,650
three important guys from academia an

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,360
eclectic consultant I can say and from

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:31,200
industry

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:35,160
and I want to ask you a very open

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,100
question so look at your glass bowl and

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:42,690
tell me where open source is going now

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:46,950
because is going towards the grid

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:50,670
cooperative projects like Jenny a dual

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,910
problem stack its goal is becoming

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,990
irrelevant because of the rise of cloud

00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,600
services and software services as

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:09,299
microsoft says and many new application

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:10,980
says or where is going open source but

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,169
from an industry perspective I would say

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,280
the open source is becoming more and

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:21,510
more prevalent you mentioned Microsoft

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:23,520
and cloud offer I don't know all the

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,440
technologies under underlying up I

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,570
imagine some of them open source but

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,280
more importantly around that if you look

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,510
at the different cloud solutions and

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,340
services that are available most of

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,760
platformed on open source technologies

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:42,030
so while from a user perspective on an

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,910
everyday desktop you may not see the

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:49,650
progression of open source that we all

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:52,770
might imagine is is wonderful I think

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,140
from a more hidden perspective on the

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,520
infrastructure side open source will

00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,870
clearly be increasingly present and

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,700
companies that don't take account of

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:07,950
that dynamic will be left behind to a

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,250
certain extent so open source as a

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,230
driver of innovation as a supporter and

00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,690
a creator of standardization or

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,840
interoperability for example I think

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,580
will be a subject which becomes more and

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,880
more present if you look at European

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,250
regulation such as the DSM are we

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,970
looking at

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:31,580
the initiatives which are specifically

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:37,310
centered around opening up the market

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:39,460
now open source is not obligatory but it

00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:45,440
will be an enabler which will facilitate

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:47,330
that kind of movement thank you I'd say

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,040
that you can't safely do cloud without

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:53,540
open source it's anyone who tells you to

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,910
use their cloud and by the way its

00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,210
proprietary has just asked you to

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:01,310
permanently become their bond slave

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:04,460
because you'll be living in permanent

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:06,500
license fee slavery to whichever company

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,120
that is I heard a company in San

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,280
Francisco recently say they were going

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,160
to become the dominant player in cloud

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,750
along with Microsoft and it's complete

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,430
rubbish you can't do open source without

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,040
though you can't do cloud without open

00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,240
source I I think what's going to happen

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,900
with open source is it's going to

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,480
rapidly become something that is

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,860
controlled and run by its users we've

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,870
gone through a phase where open source

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,360
has been controlled by vendors and in

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,930
many cases I think we're increasingly

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,060
seeing vendors avoid open source

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:42,680
monetization models and increasingly

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,480
vendors are open sourcing their

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,250
components so look at what Facebook or

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,890
Google does with open source for example

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,320
both of those companies run pretty much

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,880
exclusively on open source software and

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,590
when they invent a new thing they

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,780
release it as a new open source project

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,700
and the reason they do that is because

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,890
it increases the pace of innovation and

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,120
reduces their maintenance costs and I

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,370
think we're all going to wake up to that

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,950
sooner or later we'll see fewer and

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,180
fewer projects being run by vendors more

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,100
and more projects being run

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,320
collaboratively and finally I don't

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,180
think the desktop should be overlooked I

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,750
think we're going to see a shift within

00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:19,340
five years to a container desktop where

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,200
the platform provider is simply

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,330
providing a surface for containers to

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,040
run on and in those containers you'll be

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,350
able to run any desktop software you

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,390
want to regardless of platform and open

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,280
source is clearly preferable for running

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,440
in a container desktop so I think we're

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:37,100
going to see a change in the way desktop

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,770
runs as well the Linux desktop the year

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,520
of the Linux desktop is coming you

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:44,380
verse so I think my source is winning

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,740
but software freedom is actually losing

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,990
so I agree with with both other planet

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,360
is that open source license shot

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,310
software is something unavoidable in the

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,840
industry it's been for several years now

00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,010
and i agree with simon they would see

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,090
more and more large project initiated by

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,680
corporation or these on their

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,270
open-source licenses I think we're not

00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,280
delivering on actual software freedom

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,560
for the final users you cannot fork

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,470
github you can fork a project which is

00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,420
on github you cannot fork gmail on so on

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,490
and so forth and you cannot install

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,790
those things on your own servers and

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:21,730
that's more and more to also for very

00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,800
small devices so the phone we use Mart

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,990
phones are more and more lock it down

00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,630
devices in which sure you're on a bunch

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,950
of open-source license software but you

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,200
really don't have the control of your

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,150
device so I think this is going to be

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,430
soon a problem for industry as well

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,990
because if it's someone made a very

00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,490
convincing case about the fact the

00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,560
software freedom is actually very good

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,200
for business so I think companies are

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,760
going to see that not being able to to

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,500
sell to deploy on their own premises

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,680
very important infrastructure the year

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,360
at ion is going to be a problem for them

00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,120
hope the whole crowd sourcing paradigm

00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:00,240
around open source is clearly driver for

00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,240
innovation for an FEI industry interest

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:10,530
another question no thin does not aspire

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,530
Stefan

00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:23,919
thank you Simon is definite you

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,159
mentioned the importance of dashboards

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,590
if I understood correctly so my do you

00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,659
know of any dashboards for governance

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:35,549
that would for instance capture the

00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:39,490
number of conflicts or transparency or

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:41,830
an transparency well that would exist

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:45,820
and would this make sense to to develop

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,919
this so it's a pre requirement for that

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,769
you need documentation of all those

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,049
things things and I think in like

00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,470
decisions of decision-making bodies or

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:59,139
this kind of stuff right or you could

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:02,649
analyze the mailing lists and capture

00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:06,309
conflicts and see how its evolves and if

00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:08,500
people behave ma it's complicated but if

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,169
we want clear transparency and

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,299
accountability as you said we have to

00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,919
get metrics for governance as well so

00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,950
finding so one of the things about

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:21,549
metrics is that first auto metrics are

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:24,399
not usually useful so measuring actual

00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:28,179
things is really useful because you can

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:30,250
gain things but so most of the good

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,200
dashboards I've seen measure derivative

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,450
effects so they measure are the first or

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,750
second derivatives and so the way you

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:40,649
detect conflict for example is perhaps

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:43,720
with thread length on a mailing list

00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:46,870
where where you where you find a hot

00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,779
spot with many very long threads you're

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:53,980
probably looking at something complex or

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:56,529
or either conflict or complexity and as

00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,549
I have seen dashboards was a bit so I've

00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:00,159
spoken with the guys from Vito a

00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:02,889
reasonable amount and I have seen them

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,700
implement derivatives that do things

00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:09,639
like look at thread length look at

00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:12,490
comment the contributor diversity look

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,339
at contributor frequency or mailing

00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,679
lists as a way of and they they don't

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:19,480
say that that finds conflict but when

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,940
you look at increased thread length and

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,520
you discover that you have a increased

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,319
thread length with with no contributor

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,610
diversity it's just two people and long

00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:30,240
term

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,830
that's a conflict and so you can by

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:40,080
looking at derivatives you can detect

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:45,240
those things okay thank you another

00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:50,270
question no no okay last chance for our

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,270
last comments each of you before lunch

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,530
okay so I'm going to speak up for

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,240
copyleft licenses because there's a

00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,800
there's a natural instinct in

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,830
communities particularly business-driven

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,520
communities to fear copyleft I we've

00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:07,350
seen the pendulum swing in the favor of

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,820
non-reciprocal licenses and I think

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,560
that's a mistake because I think that

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,130
open source communities have an

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,010
expectation of contribution even when

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:19,290
they don't even when it's not in the

00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,500
license you find that most communities

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:25,230
are irritated when people only take and

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,300
never give and I think that every open

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,280
source community that I've seen expect

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,770
contribution from from its community

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,960
participants and if the license is the

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,850
constitution of the community then the

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,250
license should say contribution is

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,950
anticipated either in the form of the

00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,450
mozilla public license where you say

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,430
contribution to our work is anticipated

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,060
but your contribution of your work is

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:50,250
not required or indeed with the GPL that

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,810
you shouldn't fear the GPL the GPL

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,120
doesn't require you to make all your

00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,830
code public it merely requires you to

00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,740
offer your source code to the recipients

00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,780
of your binaries and it isn't anywhere

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,210
near as scary as people who hate it

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,910
might want you to believe so consider

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,190
copyleft model copyleft licenses are

00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,780
dangerous begin back onto that I would

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,570
say that this is particularly important

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,700
for foundation technological foundations

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,590
so foundation not in the sense of

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,140
organization instance of the technical

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,660
breaks you build your final product onto

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,480
so for instance just naming few random

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,390
exams random examples stack technologies

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,950
compilers are all where you have a lot

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,200
of companies contributing would be great

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,210
chances to use copyleft license and

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,400
guaranteeing the level playing field

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,900
that has been named multiple times on

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:45,410
this stage not legally

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:48,740
spot so I think there's a risk of the

00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,980
you have to balance the the

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,670
understanding of contribution with the

00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:59,270
the certain tendency of companies to

00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,970
look at their IP protection so that's a

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:04,730
balance how you draw the frontier

00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:07,339
between more freedoms more protection I

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:10,069
think it's a case by case basis but just

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:13,010
saying of copyleft licenses a great week

00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:15,950
let's do more often means it may be a

00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:23,690
nice idea is it really stick in today's

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:27,799
environment I would be the final World

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:30,140
word or this panel well please what join

00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:32,270
me in thanking our panelists Kristen

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,660
