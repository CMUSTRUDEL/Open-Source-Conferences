Publication date: 2015-11-24
Playlist: OW2con 2015
Description: 
	AXES (http://axes-project.eu) was a project co-funded by the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration. The goal of AXES was to develop tools that provide various types of users with new engaging ways to interact with audiovisual libraries, helping them to discover, browse, search and enrich video archives.
The OW2 WebLab (http://weblab-project.org) integration platform for multimedia processing has been used to aggregate the services developed by 9 partners in order to build the three demonstrators targeting various user groups: the media professionals, the journalists and researchers as well as the home users.
As a result of the AXES project, OW2 "Open AXES", is born. It provides a complete solution that gathers innovative audiovisual content analysis technologies (shot and keyframes detection, image classification, speech transcription, large scale indexing, similarity search, etc.) as well as an ergonomic interface to retrieve and navigate in video archives.
