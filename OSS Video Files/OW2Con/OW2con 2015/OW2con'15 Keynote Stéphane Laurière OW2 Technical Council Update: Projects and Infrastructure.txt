I will present this morning the an

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:21,420
update about the TC and first of all we

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,750
the plan was to present this update with

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,080
Santa pay on that you probably know all

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,359
of you for some personal reasons Shaun

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,090
couldn't make it today to the conference

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,309
unfortunately but we had fruitful

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,300
discussions together and also with

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,149
Cedric thanks to which we came up with

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:51,180
this update that we present you I will

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:54,300
start with the key specificities of the

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,719
UH w2 Technology Council which is as you

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:04,799
know a key component of the w2 picture

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:06,930
as Cedric also emphasized but well this

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,990
is working progress and we can discuss

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,350
it right afterwards and during the next

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,080
days from what we understand that the

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,439
there are three specificities compared

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,330
to what the other major organized

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,490
worldwide organizations that would like

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,450
to compare with that is the Eclipse

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,130
Foundation the Apache foundation and the

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,350
Linux Foundation what are these

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,259
specificities the first one is that we

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:39,180
put a very strong focus on quality

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:44,340
management the second one is that we

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:49,520
have also specific market priorities

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,869
cloud big data privacy and security and

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,100
future internet so it's a very broad

00:01:51,869 --> 00:02:01,439
scope and the third item that we can

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:04,920
mention is that we have an active

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,860
collaboration with China that started 10

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,160
years ago something like this which is

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,010
something very promising

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,940
in the sense that china is extremely

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,540
active with open source in general and

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,380
quality open source in particle that

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,060
being said what did we do like this year

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,980
Citrix say the word will read about this

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,710
about the new projects so we have

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:38,650
artists and passage which joined the

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:41,380
codebase we have two projects being in

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,620
acceptance stage at the technology

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,560
council that is a mixes mixes workflow a

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,660
German protamine a project backed by a

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,040
German company so it has its own

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,110
business model it's it's very

00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:02,410
interesting and the second one as well

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:05,890
prelude a security engine backed by CS

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,620
and the two of them are in good way to

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,630
make it for the photo for joining very

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,570
soon the codebase so it's very good news

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:19,180
and we have in the process of getting

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,520
submitted another very promising project

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,190
about storage open I all backed by a

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,900
French company other achievements is

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,380
here first of all infrastructure

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,660
management on which we worked together

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,250
not only with matter but also with

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,940
members of the community and especially

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,550
clima quemando the old one of the

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,780
authors of lemon ldap in G who really

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:49,360
helped us tremendously in setting up an

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,230
identity management infrastructure for

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,620
all of you to log on and use the audible

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,080
you to services more easily through an

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,890
online security identity the next step

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:07,780
will be access management improvements

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:11,709
in this topic let me mention that it's I

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,230
think a symbolic achievement beside

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,880
being a technical one we have now an

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:21,640
object ID at the Anna the international

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,660
organization of named that showed that

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,030
the the full acranam but the manage the

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,520
the the the idea is for four directories

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:37,080
so we have an idea therefore w-2 since a

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,300
few weeks actually we also planned a new

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:45,620
version of a w-2 stag the openstack

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:48,300
cloud at the w two meant to ease the

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,960
testing the deployment and the

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,080
demonstration of a w-2 project we have a

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,180
great idea cricket who not exactly get

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,720
the latest version but we're getting

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,880
very close to it and then this is what

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,640
has permitted the weight of the website

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,040
we have a new technology can see wiki

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,760
and next week instance and we also have

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,760
registered open other video to add open

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:20,720
web the black dog software a platform

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:22,950
for getting external metrics second

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,970
other achievement the programming

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,130
contest this year which was mostly

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,590
gathering why we had mostly Chinese

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,030
students plus an Indian team but which

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:40,110
dropped out in the meantime we have

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,290
thought we had 14 teams and I'd like to

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,470
emphasize that we had four prizes given

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,190
to trustee which is a very interesting

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:53,850
project in China actually their idea is

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,260
to give the students forge an

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,370
open-source forge which is called

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,010
trustee where they publish their student

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,470
project so I'm not sure how exactly it

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,940
works in France I mean it's a question

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm not sure how it works in the

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,190
universities where do the students are

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,200
invited to publish the code with it on

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,360
github is it that I have I'm not aware

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,200
of a national initiative like this one

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,620
which not only hosts the code but also

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,070
promotes good practices around quality

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,660
around licensing around communication so

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:34,260
I think this is something we really

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:35,940
should get inspiration from and and not

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,150
only inspiration but also technical

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,670
breaks as they are creating plugins

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:46,430
for quality assessment directly in the

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:52,120
fall and as you may know we had

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:59,110
yesterday a small cloud platform to meet

00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:02,410
our friends from TTA Thomason Julian for

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,000
working on cloud interoperable and

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,600
obviously it's it's a burgeoning product

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,400
I mean done it's an innovative

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,050
initiative I think we really should have

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,120
new ones in the future with more

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:19,490
developers of course let me finish with

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,230
the key challenges that we identified

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,950
for next year for the technology council

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,050
I think we can tell we have three main

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,410
challenges one about community and other

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,790
bad quality and last one about more

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:39,650
Kevin's I will start with the quality

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:43,160
one the technology canceled today is

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:46,180
mainly a group of project leaders what

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:50,480
we would like to propose is to formalize

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:53,380
work groups within this technology

00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,240
council that will focus on key topics

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,990
that matter through a w-2 the first one

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,590
is quality in general the second one

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,980
would be infrastructure improvement and

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,900
the third one would be it's open to

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,670
other ones with the third one will be

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,700
for the next programming contest this

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,560
year we started working closely with

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,170
Alexander is in particular even though

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,580
they had a team that dropped out but at

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:25,160
least the process for getting new teams

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,720
aboard especially European ones for

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:33,110
evaluating the work and for getting the

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,390
work really reusing add ability to

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,480
project is actually quite a lot of work

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,390
and we would need a small dedicated work

00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,440
group on this within the TC who would be

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:49,430
ready to hire more students to follow up

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,410
with the work to evaluate it and to give

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,829
the

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,259
the the quality work group would have I

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,029
will talk about this later in greater

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,839
details but the quality work group would

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:06,779
have in charge of evolving the ww2 or

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,959
open maturity model by taking into

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,290
account the recent changes in software

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:18,660
infrastructure that took place in the

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:20,550
last year and Woodall's and and the

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,350
three the third work group would be

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,129
about infrastructure and would help us

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,829
like Yemen started to do it would help

00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:32,310
Martin would even and myself evolve the

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:34,699
servers and the solutions for delivering

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:41,279
better services we need technical

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:43,709
competencies so do you thought the

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,500
challenges now also another one actually

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:49,730
that is transversal is to welcome more

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,899
not only project leaders but maybe also

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,389
external members of the open source

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,459
community especially researchers who

00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,389
have an interest in quality software

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:06,509
management system administrators who

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:09,540
know about DevOps policy makers so let's

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:12,000
see how we can widen the group to other

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,139
experts who have their have their say in

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,470
open source software quality management

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,470
