	00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,820
so I will talk about EXO key about our

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,130
product and the community behind it so

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,580
first we have am Guillaume de mo a

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,920
member of an executed autometer so a

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,539
member of the community and next week

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,550
ESS employee so I have two hats so what

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,849
we talked about first while six wiki

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,270
product is because maybe you don't know

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,940
then all the product is governed and

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,670
then what the company quick ESS is and

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,640
always a community and the company can

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,789
live together we will see the influence

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,789
of the company on the project and an

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,770
example of collaboration which is X wiki

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,030
collaborative suit that you can see on

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,300
the Wix wiki com website and at the end

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,379
we will see if everything is working so

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,729
first what is wiki is X wiki is a wiki

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,760
as the name said written in Java so we

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,479
can use also Java ecosystem it has been

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,479
created in 2004 by little big deus ex

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,909
wiki is a number of uh w2 and it's

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,030
designed for enterprises we have nice

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,939
feature like rights management or LDAP

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,549
connector or things like this a main

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,340
strength is that it allows structured

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,680
data so it's not only plain text like

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,329
for example on Wikipedia but its

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,750
structure at the time we will see after

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,150
what it is and it can be extended with

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,270
integrated scripting capabilities it

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,299
means that you can write PHP Python

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,850
JavaScript code directly in the wiki and

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:53,040
it could have be executed so you can

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:56,149
extend the weekly or easy so actually it

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,130
covers a lot of use cases so the most

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,259
famous one is knowledge bases it's like

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,110
Wikipedia it's a place where you put all

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,810
your knowledge it is good also for rock

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,729
spaces so when do you want to

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,009
collaborate on a project with a

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,750
collaborative editing for the comments

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,850
with with me too

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,630
application or you can do pause you can

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,370
use forums you have a file manager but

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,800
it also good for internet bottles

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,120
irrelevant up prices are using X wiki

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,720
for that and for public websites sue

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,670
public website too so you can see X wiki

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,670
as a content management system etc etc

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,260
there's a lot of some other use cases

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,620
with people who have a lot of

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,200
imagination so some screenshot here you

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,050
see that it's a wiki so there is a a

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,190
sandbox page that you can edit and we

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,959
have title links and so and so on we've

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,220
checked rate data so this is an

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,780
interesting thing is that here it's an

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,840
application I've met which represent all

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,700
the books that i have in my collection

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,040
so here it's very useful email and i

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,320
have different field i have the name of

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,720
the book i have description i have a

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,020
year of parisian now if the book is in

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,870
my stock or not so it's not only a plane

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,540
a plane text document it's also some

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,910
field that are easily customizable if i

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,340
want to add some field it's easy i want

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,709
to break my database because of that I

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,290
just had some new fields fields and it's

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,950
not a problem and then it's easy to

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,290
perform some theaters some queries on

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,910
the field so if i want to have only the

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,430
book that i have in my stock right now i

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,120
can do that easily if i want to have all

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,420
the books published before a certain

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
date it's easy so enterprises love that

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,220
because they can strict read their

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,160
knowledge it comes with a lot of

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,610
extensions more than 300 extensions are

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,610
on their repository right now we file

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:07,049
manager forums meeting application etc

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,880
etc it's evilly custom is able so here

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,459
we have some different themes that we

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,860
have by default but you can also going

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,829
further we've here some example of what

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,900
we do in our enterprise for some clients

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,840
so it's always extra key behind the

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,220
scene so what are the mantra so ID is to

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,470
create a tool

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,560
which will be the best way to organize

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,070
information and to collaborate and the

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,360
main idea is to stop using emailed so we

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,200
all know when we work with a lot of

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,060
colleagues we send a lot of Mayors about

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,920
the about a client about the

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,220
specification of the project and so on

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,590
so on but then if you want to find the

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,540
information six months after you have to

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,180
look at your old males and it's

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,700
difficult to do that because the

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,290
knowledge is not structured so the idea

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,290
is to put all your knowledge in the

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,220
single place which are easy to define

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,290
and if your colleague is not there

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,170
because he's on holiday oh because they

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,790
are the left the company it's easy to

00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,320
find your information and to have all

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:18,660
the knowledge that you need to take a

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:21,720
decision that's the idea behind xwiki so

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:27,510
a lot of companies already trust us like

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:31,830
an AFP or they have a w-2 we have matiko

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,630
no pants on and so on so on so the

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,900
recent feature we are working on in X

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,260
wiki are nested pages get the ability to

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,110
create pages inside some pages so at the

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,840
end you a variety of pages we've can

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,740
inherit their right system on so on so

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,870
on it does when requested by some client

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,330
we also changing our WYSIWYG editor

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,220
which is currently a custom solution and

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,130
we want to avoid a not invited here

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,890
syndrome want to use an existing wear

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,160
the wig which is ck editor which is more

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:09,270
powerful and it will be it will be less

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,850
work for us to maintain then we are

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,729
going in a direction of creating a

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,490
minimally quickie with a minimal feature

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:20,160
and then you can install the extensions

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,130
and you want on top of it to cover your

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,460
use cases but we will also provide some

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,440
flavors for different your skills like

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,990
knowledge base like rock space like

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,120
public website and the flavor will be a

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,660
collection of extensions for your use

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,710
case so it's what we are want to do what

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,690
you want to do

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:46,900
so now the community xwiki dot org is an

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,560
open source project the lysis the

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,350
license is lgpl which is quite normal

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,140
and it's drivin by its community it's

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,270
the most important thing so as many

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,790
open-source project a community gets

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,070
together on the mailing list we have

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,580
three active list with a lot of messages

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:09,730
per day and we have to mail lists so

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,410
users where users can get help from the

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:16,600
team and the dev list were developers

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,700
discuss new features or technical issues

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,260
cetera et cetera and all the all the

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,630
decisions are made on this mailing list

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,080
so some people inside the community have

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,510
a special status they are committer so

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,540
basically a committer is a developer who

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,610
have the right to push commits on the

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,250
official repository but it actually

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,010
involves more actually Oh committer have

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,860
the right to vote so when a new feature

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:48,100
is proposed or when some important

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,260
challenge changes are going to be made

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,840
we organize the vote and we say okay I

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,940
agree or I don't agree it's actually a

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,000
duty to vote because when some people

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,920
won't work on an important feature it's

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,910
important that they don't waste a waste

00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:07,090
time to wait for people to answer to the

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,510
world so it's actually a duty to vote an

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:14,410
important thing is like each committer

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,690
add a veto right it means any commuter

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,340
can block a proposal even if the

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,860
proposal comes from my companion for

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,960
example okay he needs to have good

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,200
reason is not just because it wants to

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,490
jog but each committer obvious way to

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,980
write a cometer has also privileged

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,010
access to infrastructure so the bug

00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:39,220
tracker official website the CI server

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,800
the get up and ministration etc etc it

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,410
also adds duty to perform releases at

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,210
this one pair here because it takes time

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,330
to do a release so it's good that

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,100
everybody contribute to the effort and

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,930
we also have the duty to watch

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,210
everything

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,610
that happens in the repository so we can

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,430
verify its quality so every time a

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,560
change is made in X wiki we have a lot

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,800
of eyes who look at the code and say

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,710
okay this could be improved this is not

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,580
that good oh this is nice so the quality

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:13,470
is managed thanks to this we also have

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,570
the duty to look at contribution so

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,000
basically it's pull request on github

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,190
and apply them if possible know when

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,640
it's not possible we discuss with the

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:27,600
contributor on we try to help him to

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,670
create a better better contribution more

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,770
generally is the commuter discuss about

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,800
the direction of the project what we

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:38,700
want on what we don't want and if you

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,330
want to see all all being a committer

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,529
involves you can see it on our website

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:49,230
everything is documented and transparent

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:52,920
so an important thing is that all chrome

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:56,190
eaters have the same right there is no

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,250
leader no boss no believer o no

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,380
benevolent dictator for life so it's not

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,050
like the Linux community where you have

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,070
Linda Stahl value as yen of always the

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,800
last word it's more like a democracy

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:14,220
like the apache software foundation or

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,440
like debian so all the decisions have to

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,300
be made democratically then how to

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,459
become a committer first you have to

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,770
prove yourself by doing some poor

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,500
request and if we think that you are

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,779
good enough one of the comet or can

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,850
propose the given the status and we

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,589
organize the vote and we say okay we

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:40,110
want him to be a committer or oh no so

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:42,290
know that newcomers are welcome if you

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,430
want to contribute to this great project

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:52,130
feel free and we will welcome you are we

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:54,329
work every day we create a roadmap a

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,490
roadmap is discussed by all the

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,410
computers and the current map will

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,410
define the objective for the coming year

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,480
what we want to achieve this year so it

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,970
brings some visibility brings

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,790
we want to do for the community for all

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,589
I mean all the users know where we are

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:17,050
going to now I will talk about my

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:21,940
company not my company but the company

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:24,250
who employ me XO key SS is the company

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,180
founded by X which is creator or Ludovic

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,790
to bust it provides support posting and

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,670
services for clients interested in next

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,860
wiki and it actually found some

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,860
commuters for who is there full-time

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:42,579
jobs so currently six kilometers our

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,339
salary divx wiki SS and most of the work

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:49,240
done on the product come from this six

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:52,870
persons x week SS also provides

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,029
infrastructure or the servers etc and a

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,920
quality team who is in charge of testing

00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,199
the new version Alex wiki and

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,720
contributing to the documentation of

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:04,269
thanks to them we may need to have a

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,459
good quality as there in the product or

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:12,190
in in the documentation so what can we

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,649
say about X wiki SS is it an uninsured

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,740
photo project or a diva we want to

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:21,279
control everything so what I think is

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:24,430
ethics week SS play the game over

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,730
princess although all the contribution

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:30,760
are still open source there is some

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,750
committers we have no relation with the

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,930
company and is good we want that some

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,269
commuters are former on price will keep

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,399
the committal status and it's normal

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:45,670
it's not because you leave the company

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,370
that you lay out the project to because

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,410
there are two distinct entities so we

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,889
have some former employees will still

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:58,709
continue to contribute on the project Oh

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,709
are running business on top of X wiki

00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:05,290
also your ex week ESS and pray and pray

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,600
is proposed a roadmap but then it's

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,810
disgusting modified by all the community

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,350
by all the commuters nothing is imposed

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,220
by the company and actually x.x week ESS

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,920
will love to see more companies found

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,879
the project because it will be a win-win

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,329
situation xwiki sis will benefit from

00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,500
the investments done by other company

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:32,339
meanwhile the others company will

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,579
benefit from our investment so it would

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,160
be a win-win situation now you may say

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,290
since six who cares has found most of

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,779
the developers the company must have

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:47,189
creating free on Thunder project and I

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:49,620
will say yes of course indeed but also

00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:53,069
committer are still ABS the veto rights

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,439
it's very important and developers from

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:57,560
other companies can join the project so

00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:01,410
that it will be more balanced at the m

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,339
it was it's already arrived sometimes we

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:07,680
as at xkss we do some proposal and then

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,680
some people on the committee say no I

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,740
put the veto so either we create an

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,769
extension but not integrated by default

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,019
in the product as are we we do another

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:23,220
proposal which is going to be accepted

00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:26,040
by by the people the current situation

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,860
of being the main sponsor is not an

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:34,589
objective of the company it just the

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:37,920
fact that sukkz wiki apply an open core

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:40,680
strategy I say no because alka tribution

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,559
are free you know what an open co

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,500
strategy is is when you ever the core of

00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,750
your of your application which is open

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,480
source ok but then you have a lot of

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,939
extensions who are not open source well

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,250
you have to pay for and actually what

00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,470
you want it's a war package you are not

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,430
interested bye only the core so it's not

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,579
real open source just it's open cover

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,559
each week SS doesn't want to do that

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:11,220
they want to be a real open source

00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,709
company so the consequences of all of

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,800
this is that the distinct between the

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:19,740
project and the company is well managed

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,589
in my opinion so maybe it could be more

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,740
explicit by renaming the project and the

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:28,800
question has been asked already so maybe

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,710
by create create a name without the wiki

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,660
part because we we do so

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:39,950
Schmalz on a wiki that maybe we should

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:43,670
use another name so no this is a new

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:45,680
product that my company is doing and you

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,300
might say okay it's a controller example

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,370
what you are saying no even know if wiki

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,480
SS is creating a new product which is

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:59,060
called a quickie collaborative suit and

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,090
its distribution of X wiki package with

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,000
a collection of extensions and some of

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,580
them are extension specific to our

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,890
company for example we have an extension

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,490
for a support team which you have to pay

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:15,560
so of course this kind of extensions the

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,560
community don't want to have to have

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,590
them in X wiki by default for example we

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,260
have some links to go to our website

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:27,530
where we sell some services so it's it's

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,420
like advertising and the community don't

00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,150
want to have it by default in a quickie

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,150
so we do another project to side

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:38,300
projects we have this company with these

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:43,090
products sorry custom is that for what

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:45,980
we want here a screenshot of excess

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:49,640
excess is still not on the pin core

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,530
strategy all the extensions are free and

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,680
all the source code is available on open

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:58,160
source the only difference between pic

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,620
CS on the Manics wikidot or project is

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,890
that this project is not led by the

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:08,170
community but by the company of course

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:11,240
because it's only for all needs it's for

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:15,110
being more integrated with our own and

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,800
fresh texture etc etc so we can see that

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:22,010
ETS is definitively not a danger for the

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,589
X wiki dog project actually then it's an

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,740
opportunity because it's a good way to

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:30,440
test our instance ability since we try

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,670
to make the project moduli enough so

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,920
that a lot of different distribution

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,470
could exist depending on the user needs

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,640
it's good that we have access to test if

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,920
it is efficient or not so it's an

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,390
opportunity not a problem

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:53,040
so now is it healthy does it work for me

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:56,340
xwiki dot our is ealthy why because the

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,370
milling leads are active we do frequent

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,940
releases we have a lot of downloads and

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,600
we're serious product in the competition

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:09,900
according to our users so I would say

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,720
that 2x wiki democracy works and when I

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,940
first joined xwiki some years ago I was

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,880
very skeptical about this I was thinking

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,670
that we need a Steve Jobs guy very

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,830
brilliant with very good ideas so we'll

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,160
have would be successful thanks to him

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:28,980
but I am forced to admit that the X we

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,120
keep model works so that the democracy

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:36,750
works it works for countries maybe it

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,780
rocks for our product and maybe it's

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,860
going to work for your organization's to

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,860
