Title: OW2con'15 Keynote Bruno Dillenseger : Benchmarking Orange Forge with CLIF
Publication date: 2015-11-24
Playlist: OW2con 2015
Description: 
	At the middle of this year, Orange switched its internal software forge (so-called Orange Forge) to a completely new hardware infrastructure and a new version of the Tuleap forge software. With more than 1000 connected users daily, among 16000 registered users worldwide, working on more than 5000 active projects, this switch was definitely a critical operation.
Could this new brand new Orange Forge platform cope with such a traffic? If so, what about users' quality of experience? This is what we tried to know using OW2's load testing project CLIF. Feedback says it was a good idea to do so.
