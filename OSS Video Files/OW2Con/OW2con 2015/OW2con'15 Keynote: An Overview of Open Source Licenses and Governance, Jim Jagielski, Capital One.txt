salut and Bonjour everyone my name is

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,790
Jim jackowski and first and foremost I

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,220
want to send my thoughts and prayers to

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,570
everyone in pairs especially those

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,699
directly affected by the tragic events

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,670
over the weekend and I apologize

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,910
personally for not being able to attend

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,550
the conference whoever I hope this short

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,989
video presentation will make some amends

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,450
for my inability to attend and of course

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,510
if you have any questions or comments I

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,579
won't be able to address them

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,920
interactively but I do provide my

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,110
contact information at the end so please

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,690
feel free to contact me with any

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,550
feedback questions or comments thank you

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,770
very much a little bit about me I am a

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,289
co-founder of apache software foundation

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,409
and I assume most people know me by my

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,130
association with a SF I'm also a

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,750
director of numerous open-source

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,500
foundations out there as well as X

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,750
directors of some such as OSI I guess

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,020
the biggest thing that I am a hacker and

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,479
so everything that I've come on up with

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,470
my involvement in open-source actually

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,320
derives from a hacker background and I

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,689
am very very happy that I've got a

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,460
absolutely fantastic job as senior

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,420
director in the tech fellows program

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,939
with capital one which kind of actually

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,400
makes this presentation a little bit

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,460
about what's in your project if you're

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,490
familiar with capital one which is a

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,470
us-based card credit card services their

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,090
tagline is what's in your wallet so I

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,340
kind of like thought this was this is

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,000
kind of fun what we'll be talking about

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,500
today are actually licenses governance

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,479
and community first of all is the idea

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,429
or the question of why do we need

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:11,790
licenses the main reason of course is

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,830
that copyright is the default unless

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,860
there is a specific and explicit

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,350
such license associated with a work with

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,230
a software project it's assumed to be

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,080
under copyright which really restricts

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,300
and limits what can be done with it as

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,200
far as end-users and redistribute and

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,690
stuff like that and so to ensure that

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,600
something is open source means that you

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,520
need to have an open source licence

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,500
associated with that now the goals of

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,860
any open source license whether you call

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,790
it open source or free software is to

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,280
ensure which parts remain open and free

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,430
and to maintain some level of control

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,950
over the code and direction as well as

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,770
to build a community or a commercial

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,200
marketplace around that software project

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,690
itself and of course for most end-users

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,370
this is their only interaction with the

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,180
open source project itself is the

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,430
license which controls limits restricts

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,750
and allows how they're able to use and

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,340
and redistribute the software out there

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,410
for software to be open source as it

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,380
said before it must be under an OSI

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,750
approved open-source license there are

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,080
very very many of them at last count

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,370
over 60 of those exist but really when

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,030
you think about it there are actually

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,420
three main types of open-source licenses

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,510
out there as I mentioned before

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:44,310
especially in the European Union open

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:47,580
source is not as a phrase used the term

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,310
free software is is much much more based

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,100
in in how people are looking at the

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,750
software free software and open source

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,840
are kind of like pretty much the exact

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,050
same there's sort of like two sides of

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,680
the same same coin and so in a lot of

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,360
spaces you'll see it not called you know

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,060
free software open source but actually

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,680
false free Libre libre as in the you

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,940
know the freedom associated with that

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,850
open source software now of course the

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,450
OSI has a list of characteristics and

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,280
criteria that require or defined what an

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,730
open-source license should be the Free

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,850
Software Foundation

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,460
actually has a list of four freedoms

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,010
which must be maintained for something

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,310
to be you know characterized as free

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,230
software language or a free software

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,630
software project kind of like think we

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,840
can actually make that even easier and

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,140
just fill that down to three promises

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,080
that the license itself gives to the end

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,100
users to make this easier to understand

00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,940
let's pretend that the source code the

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,100
program are actually cookies the actual

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,260
kind of cookies that you eat biscuits if

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,190
you're if you're English you're from the

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,470
UK and so not only is it the actual

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,010
cookies themselves but the recipes that

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,880
are part of how you create the cookie

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,580
itself so the first promise is the

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,020
ability to actually use the the software

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,840
project itself as you see it's the the

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,610
promise that you can use the recipe to

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,830
actually create the cookie but also to

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:39,670
eat the cookie as well now there are a

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,210
couple of you know implicit criteria in

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,590
that with the ability to use for example

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,780
you have to be able to read the recipe

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,120
you have to be able to understand the

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,520
recipe to be able to use it to actually

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
create the cookie so of course access to

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,910
the recipe itself is is is inherent in

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,370
the idea of using the software also

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,910
you're able to use the cookie I use the

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,430
software in the expected way that the

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,890
original person created the other

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,090
software project so with the case of a

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,620
cookie you're actually eating a cookie

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,530
but you actually use it for other things

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,120
as well if for example you have a wobbly

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,670
table then you want to put a cookie

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,340
under one of the legs of the table to

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:25,900
stabilize it well that's a no and that's

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,180
an acceptable use of it so there the the

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,400
definition of the word use is really up

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,800
to the end-user itself that is one of

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,160
the promises associated with a free

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,930
software and an open-source license

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,840
another promise of the ability to modify

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,380
that cookie or the modify that software

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,560
program

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,320
again using the cookie analogy we can

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,560
see that if you have a base cookie

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,810
recipe if you want to go and add

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,990
chocolate chips or maybe make it a more

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,210
cake-like or little more doughy like

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,210
you're able to modify the actual recipe

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,790
itself to have an end result of a cookie

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,160
which is much more in tune with what you

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,580
want and not necessarily restricted to

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,470
what the original recipe defined not

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,720
only that but you can take the resulting

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,300
cookie assuming is based on the original

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,730
recipe and actually modify it at the end

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,640
of it so in this situation right here we

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,750
see the characteristic of having a

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,880
original cookie but we're actually

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,650
modifying the end result by putting some

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,930
pie see on top of it that's another

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,150
promise that the that open source and

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,360
free software provides and finally the

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,880
promise to be able to share the the

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,100
recipe as well as any modifications to

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,040
that recipe as well the one of the nice

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,010
things about you know sharing software

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,750
and programs is that unlike in the case

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,910
of sharing your cookie you're not left

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,190
with less of a cookie you can share with

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:56,290
as many people as possible and it

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:58,450
doesn't reduce your access to that but

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,540
the ability to share those modifications

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,720
as well as the original content itself

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,140
is crucial to the whole concept of open

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,460
source and free software out there

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,820
notice I mentioned previously there are

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,550
three main types open-source licenses

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,620
out there the first main type is what I

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,340
call to give me credit these are the

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:24,310
permissive licenses such as the Apache

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,960
v2 license MIT and BSD and these are

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,320
basically saying we don't care what you

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,060
do with the with the software itself you

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,620
just can't claim it's your original

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,390
creation you have to give us credit for

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,190
you know for the original thing that you

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:45,280
you received from us more way to explain

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,220
this is just imagine again using the

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,150
cookie recipe analogy that you take a

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,370
base cookie recipe and you modify it the

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,410
actual recipe itself maybe adding

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,680
some eggs a little bit less sugar maybe

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,020
a different kind of flour so you have

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,450
the original recipe your modifications

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,270
to that recipe and say you also have

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,020
this family secret recipe for chocolate

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,610
chips and you want to add that into the

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,790
cookie itself so that's a modification

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,720
that's the derivative work of that

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,760
recipe well they give me credit license

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,029
the permissive licenses do not require

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,060
you to give those modifications away you

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,560
can keep those modifications as family

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,350
secrets as something which is

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,730
proprietary to yourself you just need to

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,920
make sure that anyone who has that that

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,930
new and improved cookie knows where to

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,260
get the original recipe I but so there's

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,279
really no restrictions on or

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,710
requirements for you to give any of that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,710
stuff back of course in most cases the

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,600
the hope and expectation are you know is

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,779
that you will but it's not a requirement

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,760
up there now the second type is what's

00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,190
called a week copyleft and of course the

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,070
Eclipse public license and the lesser

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,959
GPL were great examples of this and the

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,230
idea behind this is basically you're

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,510
just required to give this fixes back

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,750
again looking at that that new and

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,450
enhanced cookie that I just spoke about

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:19,240
if you're redistributing those cookies

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,180
you are required to give those changes

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,920
to the actual original recipe back to

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,589
the original recipe owner you know so

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,990
the way you've changed and modified that

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,330
recipe needs to be given back so that

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,900
way the recipe can be you know

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,670
maintained you know improved and there's

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,589
improvements to the base recipe can be

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,839
shared with other people but the

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,920
addition of those chocolate chips those

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,450
chocolate chips can still stay as a

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,250
family ticket or a trade secret you

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:52,810
don't need to because they're you know

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,020
separate from the actual recipe itself

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:58,089
and not a modification or enhancement to

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,370
the actual recipe you just need to give

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,320
the recipe changes back and you're still

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:07,120
able to keep the the chocolate chip

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,080
recipe as a long-term trade secret and

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,210
finally we have the

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,460
the third type of license which is the

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,850
give me everything or the strong

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,340
copyleft licenses now these are the kind

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,830
of requirements that basically say

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,930
because everything else is is is free

00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,020
require everything else to be free as

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,090
well so again going with this cookie

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,030
analogy you would need you are required

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,830
to give not only the recipe improvements

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,340
back to the community but you would also

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,750
be required to share your family's shake

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,880
your chocolate chip recipe that would

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,190
actually need to be part of what's also

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,940
provided to out there so as you can see

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,170
that the GPL nature is kind of sticky

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,000
it's kind of like a little bumblebee

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,420
that goes as it goes from flower to

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,450
flower or entity inside of a software

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,640
project it actually gets combined with

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,230
with all the other things and it's sort

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,800
of like pollinates all the other

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:06,100
software components to also be GPL as

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,650
well there are also three main types of

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,770
governance and community first of all is

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,800
the walled garden type which are very

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,630
very self control by usually a

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,290
commercial entity these are very very

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,320
restrictive as far as what patches are

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,670
provided in a central agency serves as

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,770
the the choke point for these kinds of

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,600
patches and improvements and in general

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,880
the entire open-source community has

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,340
very very limited control over the

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,040
direction and future of these software

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,010
projects the second main type is what's

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,720
called the benevolent dictator for life

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,030
this is kind of like a walled garden in

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,480
the very case that there is a single

00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,850
entity that that controls where this

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,980
goes but in this situation it's the

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,680
community that assigns that power or

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,020
authority to to the entity it's not

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,060
assumed by the entity the community

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,840
provides that and a great example this

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,710
of course is the the Linux system itself

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,230
where lena's has basically total control

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,630
over what goes into the the Linux kernel

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,500
and the third main type is what's called

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:20,080
meritocracy in which it's really much a

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,610
community-based effort the community

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:27,070
itself controls and defines the process

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,740
the future the enhancements the

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,320
direction of an open source project it

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,300
really is government by the masses out

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,010
there and finally we'll talk a bit a

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,010
little bit about how you're able to

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,140
build community we like to use inside of

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,300
the asf mailing lists because they are

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,670
asynchronous they don't disenfranchise

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,190
people from different time zones so

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,660
again you may not need to use mailing

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,590
list but just make sure that you're not

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,510
requiring any sort of development

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:58,030
process or methodology that requires

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,220
people to be face-to-face in the same

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:03,220
time zone or anything like that you want

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,980
to encourage involvement and activity

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,090
for people no matter where they are

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,370
another thing that's very very important

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,890
is to drive consensus make sure that the

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,920
entire community is involved in the

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,470
health and future of a project by

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,650
ensuring the health and viability of a

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,480
community you're also enjoying and

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,250
ensuring the viability and long-term

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,860
success of the project itself and

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,600
finally avoid the concept of poisonous

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,400
people people who you know create a lot

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,770
of friction inside the community by

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,510
doing so you're really restricting and

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,060
limiting the amount of diversity in the

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,130
community you're getting you're creating

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,790
community in which new people new

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,130
talents new ideas are not welcomed and

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,360
of course that is the death knell for

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,010
the continued support viability of

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,660
projects out there so basically the

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,760
three main things when you're creating

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:03,190
an open source project is to play nice

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:05,890
to share and to have fun merci thank you

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,110
