Title: OW2con'15 Keynote Philippe Ozil: Software extensibility of an Open Source project
Publication date: 2015-11-25
Playlist: OW2con 2015
Description: 
	As a Business Process Management Software (BPMS) vendor, we at Bonitasoft face the challenge of addressing diversified projects from various industry sectors.We believe that the key to our success in doing so is to remain a generic solution. Yet, too much genericity may weigh on end-users and this can lead to rejection.
Because Open Source is part of our roots, we value the capability to customize and extend our solution. However, despite proposing an open source code, the problem we faced a couple years ago was that there were too few people willing or able to contribute to our core.To counter that, we have continuously developed extension points in our software to simplify the act of contributing and we have provided a platform for sharing contributions.
Adopting this strategy has proven to be rewarding and we have been able to leverage the creativity of our community. It has allowed us to avoid the pitfall of releasing a software that is generic but not flexible enough and instead, deliver tool that allows building business applications that can adapt to changes in real time.
Follow this presentation and learn about the challenges we faced and how we addressed them.
