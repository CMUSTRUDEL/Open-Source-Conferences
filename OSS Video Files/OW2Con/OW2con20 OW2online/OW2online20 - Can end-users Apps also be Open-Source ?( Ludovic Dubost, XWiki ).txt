Title: OW2online20 - Can end-users Apps also be Open-Source ?( Ludovic Dubost, XWiki )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	Open-Source is highly present. However, the competition in the end-user app space with Cloud providers is tough. A lot of proprietary solutions exist and are build on Open-Source libraries and technologies, but are not shared as Open-Source. XWiki SAS is a provider of open-source collaboration apps (XWiki, CryptPad) for now 15 years living only off it's Open-Source technologies. How is it possible to develop Open Source end-user apps ? What are the challenges to achieve this ? How do you finance the technology ? How do you sell it ? How do you differentiate your software from proprietary solutions ? This is the aim of this presentation, to share our experience and our history.

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,949
welcome to can end-user apps the open

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,520
source at the audible YouTube online

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,859
2020 conference

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm very happy to participate to this

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,830
first online conference and I hope

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:30,599
you're having a great time at home so

00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:34,649
Who am I I'm I'm Ludovic debossed

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,360
CEO and founder of X wiki we've been

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,829
developing attics wiki leaks wiki

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,129
software for more than Kenny

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,230
10-15 years and this software is a

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,660
collaborative software allowing you to

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,760
help organize your information we're

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,340
also building the quit pat software

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,649
which is an innovative software allowing

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,559
to collaborate in real time and edit

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,859
documents while these documents are

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,309
fully end-to-end encrypted it's a system

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,220
that will protect your information all

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,049
our developments in the last 15 years

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,720
have been open source and we've been

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,729
developing the business of X wiki so

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,040
that we can sustain the development of

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:19,350
this software so first I'd like to point

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
out that open source is quite strong we

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,210
see we have the feeling that open source

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,070
is everywhere open source is the key of

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,009
the Internet infrastructure it's also

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,290
full I mean completely prevalent for

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,869
development tools and libraries and we

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,000
can see that actually most proprietary

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,509
software today dual of open source and

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,430
our build on top of them however if you

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,729
look a little bit at the financials and

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,540
you if you consider that there is a one

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:55,110
trillion dollar tech industry and a lot

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,360
of them being developers well when we

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,299
try to analyze the the open source

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,579
businesses and whether it is open source

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,369
being developed by the main the large

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,110
taking giants or whether it is open

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,300
source developed by commercial open

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,560
source companies and then we

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,150
we get to some level around ten billion

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,760
and it's not easy to get further than

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,550
that and if you look at donations to

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,770
open-source developers then we're still

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,930
in the millions or tens of millions of

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:30,190
dollars and this actually represents

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:34,390
just one one store of the big tower and

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,700
that represents that tech industry we

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,790
can also actually see that there is a

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,710
ceiling for for end-user app so while we

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,000
have a lot of development tools and we

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:49,140
have a lot of of infrastructure system

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,150
that are very strong with open-source

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,900
well when it comes to end-user apps we

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,780
see that they they compete with with a

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,060
lot of cloud services which themselves

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,760
are using a lot of open source code but

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,150
are not open source themselves and this

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,000
competition show has the effect today

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,180
that a lot of these applications are are

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,970
actually provided by a cloud of

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,550
propriety providers so there is a

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:23,520
domination of the cloud and proprietor

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,520
providers when it comes to end-user apps

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,060
so I won't go too much in the details

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,239
why we need open source and your labs

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,370
we're all here convinced that this is

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,200
what we want I mean there is control

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,140
there is sovereignty there is openness

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,520
flexibility and freedom and it's not the

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,660
subject of the presentation today and

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,940
what I want to look at is the

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:51,010
differences of the business model of the

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,770
cloud and proprietary software business

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,570
and open-source ones well if we if we

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,630
analyze the proprietary software

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,910
provider and so you have a few proper

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,220
providers that are collaborating on some

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,519
open source code mostly libraries or

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:10,180
development tools and they are providing

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,660
high margin services to customers based

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,049
a lot on proprietary code or or on cloud

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,700
services that they provide you also have

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,620
sometimes open source companies that

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,450
work on the same libraries and try to

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,780
get some revenue or get some revenue

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,450
from this company

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,380
from from end-user company that are that

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,880
are using the software which which makes

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,889
that the the open-source community

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,020
around the open source code is quite

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,720
vibrant but it represents a small

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,710
fraction of the actual value that is

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,050
provided to customers when we when we

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,000
look at an end-user open source app

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,560
business model that is providing an app

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,380
directly to customers well you realize

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,419
that it's not multiple companies that

00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,090
work off the same codebase it's often

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,890
one company which is the main

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,720
contributor to the open source code and

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,780
they're not that many alternate

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,810
contributors to that code so sometimes

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,419
that company has a proprietary or paying

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,150
modules which represents a fraction of

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,680
the value-add compared to the open

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,870
source code that open source code is

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,140
also used directly by open source users

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:23,090
for free and open source company is

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,740
making revenue directly with customers

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,350
that are transforming from the open

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,570
source users well the open source coder

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,490
can also be used by other company cloud

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:38,660
or proprietary software companies this

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,090
creates four questions that that make it

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,490
not necessarily easy for the open source

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,380
company the first question is our open

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,780
source users actually contributing or

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,760
buying services the second one is can

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,010
all other open source companies join and

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,080
contribute to the same code third

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,360
question is can cloud providers be

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,860
partners or are they competitors the

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,250
first question is how big is the

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,680
proprietary code in the in the offer of

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,250
the open source company in order to be

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,930
able to sustain the open source business

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,890
so if we look at these four questions

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,570
make make it a challenging business for

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,630
Pancho's companies to compete with the

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,400
cloud services if we summarize it's

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,350
harder to get contributors and sales

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,240
services to end-user you have less

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,970
companies building on the same code base

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,039
you need to rely more on paying products

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,960
to finance the code and scale and cloud

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,090
boosters can potentially compete with

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,669
your own software how can we actually

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,740
fix that

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,100
so the first

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,050
is our open source users come to you

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,240
contributing well this raises the

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,760
questions for open source users that if

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,730
they want more open source app they need

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,280
to question themselves how is that open

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,160
source company living in and who is

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,810
producing that software and one way or

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,290
another they need to find a way to

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,360
contribute to that free software public

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,350
administration actually do because they

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,790
they help fund a lot of open source are

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,920
in these through French or European

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,650
projects attics wiki we've been very

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,780
happy both for its wiki and crib pad to

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,560
be able to have some funding from public

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,380
entities and so one way for for

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,140
end-users for users to contribute to the

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,450
to to the software is to contribute to

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,160
the community itself participate to the

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,180
community this is the sense of open

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:36,390
source open community you can come and

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,300
help with the software you can also

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,760
sponsor a teacher attics wiki we've had

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,910
a lot of sponsorship of teacher and this

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,310
is quite interesting to fund and R&D but

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,580
these type of funding they don't help

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,860
maintain a long term around long term

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,130
funding of the open source developers

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,800
and this is what support or extensions

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,440
can can help and so as an end user if

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,110
you pay support or buy extensions and

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,090
you will help fund the new open source

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,180
code and the first way which is more

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,670
rare is donate but it's something that

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:18,570
is developing ways open collected for

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:20,450
example now the second question is can

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,880
other open source software companies

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,470
contribute so is there a way for for the

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,600
different open source companies that

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,140
work together in the same ecosystem and

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,300
to potentially work together so first if

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,050
you're if you're a company and if your

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,390
service company or if you're a

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,400
development company then you can you can

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,380
pay support or you can buy pro version

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,050
or self reversion through your customer

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,420
you can also donate the same things that

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,520
apply for the end user can also apply

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,329
for an intermediary or another developer

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,149
that would work

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,309
with the same codebase um open source

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,779
companies should integrate with other

00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,549
open source app so there can be

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,040
partnerships between the open source

00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:04,350
companies so that it's possible to

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,970
provide a bigger offering instead of

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,360
potentially competing with each other

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,040
and you can contribute to the community

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,739
and another aspect is that they they

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,489
could be stricter licenses also to

00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:21,589
protect the whole open-source ecosystem

00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:24,720
from from the non open source ones which

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:27,839
which which could use the same code base

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,980
so the use of stricter licenses like a

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:35,459
GPL can help give the open source

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,429
software industry some advantage over

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,170
the non open source industry by the fact

00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,739
that each other they can reuse the

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,999
software of the other open source users

00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:48,420
another thing that hasn't been really

00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:50,730
worked on is how can you share business

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,980
towards the upstream open source code so

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,799
if it's an open source developer is you

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,389
be using another office or the tool how

00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,980
can they share and the value with the

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:07,079
different providers of the open source

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,639
code the third question was can King

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,889
cloud providers be partners of

00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,869
competitors we've seen that cloud

00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:15,689
providers can actually decide to be

00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:17,939
competitors but if they do they will

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,549
destroy the ecosystem so we need we need

00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:22,889
some some way where it's going to be

00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:24,779
more win-win between cloud providers and

00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,549
open source providers and cloud

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,290
providers need to support open source

00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:31,019
app and one very interesting way to

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,689
actually do that is to develop

00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,249
marketplaces of open source software it

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,499
would be really valuable to have a

00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:41,579
marketplace which will bring back

00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:43,290
support revenue or paying revenue to to

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:47,160
the developers of the open source

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,399
software and not only revenue to the

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,739
cloud providers through the hosting and

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,839
and and the stricter licenses and paying

00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:56,699
module here are also potentially of

00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,309
protections towards the cloud providers

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,720
that would not work together with the

00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,750
open source developer to create a

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,180
win-win situation in terms

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,890
what is being provided another aspect is

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,900
that the market phase could also be very

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,880
interesting for public administration to

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,740
provide open-source software to the

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,650
public administration and also bring

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,580
back some revenue to the initial

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,350
developer of the open source software

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,840
for the first question is how big is the

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,300
paying service box so what is for sure

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,670
is that paying services are key to fund

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,240
open source code if you only found a

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,340
software developer using using pure

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,310
services pure development services it's

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,430
gonna be almost impossible to scale and

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:45,170
it's gonna be hard to build very

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,330
advanced and use a software and and for

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,310
sure not everything can be free if there

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,440
if everything is free and all users are

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,470
using everything for free then there's

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,110
going to be an impossibility at some

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,150
point to finance the software and the

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,890
only way to finance it will be to pay

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,810
for certain specific modules but

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:08,240
maintenance will never be financed for

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:11,380
example and in here now what I want to

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,380
point out is that it's not necessarily

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,610
necessary here to make this paying

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,740
package proprietary software it is

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,450
possible to make paying packages that

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,510
are open-source themselves and this is a

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,150
choice that we have decided to do attics

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,660
wiki where all our software is open

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,880
source under the same license LGPL but

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,620
we're not packaging these these modules

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,970
and these extensions to its wiki for

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,610
free we are packaging them paying on our

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:43,670
extension repository and selling these

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,500
extensions but if if if other providers

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,360
want to come work with us on the code

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,770
and it's possible because everything is

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,870
open-source and it's important also for

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,450
the open source provided to control the

00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,200
level of nono purchase every day Rd at

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:03,350
some point if your amount of R&D is

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,730
going is going in majority to

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:12,200
proprietary software or to services for

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,110
for selling then you're not really an

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,430
open source provider anymore and this is

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,899
where transparency is I

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,779
actually quite important I think

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,420
open-source company should bring more

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,880
transparency to how they make business

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,220
and what amount of R&D they're spending

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,130
for which part of the business and to

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,779
show that there they are provided that

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,040
has the objective of sustaining the

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:40,100
open-source model what I want everybody

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,380
to to to remember is that open-source

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,910
apps cannot be fully free because it's

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,490
gonna be very different difficult to

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,180
develop them and that one way or another

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,550
users need to support them you can

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,490
contact me by email or you can also use

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,580
our software on its wiki org or provided

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,649
for and you can also support this on on

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,570
open connected thank you very much and

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,260
have a great or the will to online

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,260
