Description: 
	Open-Source is highly present. However, the competition in the end-user app space with Cloud providers is tough. A lot of proprietary solutions exist and are build on Open-Source libraries and technologies, but are not shared as Open-Source. XWiki SAS is a provider of open-source collaboration apps (XWiki, CryptPad) for now 15 years living only off it's Open-Source technologies. How is it possible to develop Open Source end-user apps ? What are the challenges to achieve this ? How do you finance the technology ? How do you sell it ? How do you differentiate your software from proprietary solutions ? This is the aim of this presentation, to share our experience and our history.
