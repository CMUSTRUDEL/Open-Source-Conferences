Title: OW2online20 OSS Country Intelligence Report
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	( Open Source Observatory (OSOR) Team - European Commission )
The objective of this presentation is to briefly present the country intelligence reports on open source software policies within the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom. Produced as part of the Open Source Observatory (OSOR) of the European Commission, the reports provide an overview of the governance, political and legal frameworks as well as open source software initiatives. We will focus on two aspects: public sector bodies addressing open source software and legal and political initiatives specifically addressing open source software. Our presentation will also include insights on key governmental bodies and strategic players involved as well as examples of the political and legal frameworks addressing open source.

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,500
hello all and welcome to our

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,869
presentation for today is ow2 online

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,340
conference my name is Claire and today

00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,170
I'll be joined by my colleague Vivian

00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,029
from the open source Observatory team of

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,950
the European Commission to talk about

00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:30,599
open source software policies across

00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:33,460
Europe thank you - Oh W - for hosting us

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,290
before diving into our overview on open

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,000
source software policies across Europe

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,829
we will start by giving a little bit of

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,950
background information about azure

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,110
and what it is that we do the open

00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,450
source observatory also known as azure

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,360
is a european commission project hosted

00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,620
on the join of collaborative platform

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,480
azure serves as a middle ground to

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,800
connect european public administrations

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,340
with other relevant stakeholders

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,260
involved or interested in open source it

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,150
also continuously supports the dynamic

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,580
community and promotes the use of open

00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,259
source software in the public sector the

00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,210
general aim here is to be a trustworthy

00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:10,960
observatory providing open source

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,640
software expertise and information the

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,400
content on Azure is quite varied

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,470
including monthly newsletters event

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,570
listings for Azure and other open source

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,340
software events and news about the

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,310
latest developments and open source in

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,920
the public sector that being said we're

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,420
not just an observatory azure strives to

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,370
play an active role in the open source

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,470
community by promoting open source

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,440
software and helping European countries

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,510
with its adoption we regularly organize

00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,760
events ourselves and attend relevant

00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,700
events in Europe such as this o w2

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,320
online conference by doing this we are

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,479
constantly working to develop closer

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,880
ties to the community and to keep asura

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,200
relevant to your needs

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,700
Asura also hosts the Knowledge Center

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,049
which has been a key priority this year

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,210
the knowledge centres content is

00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,979
continuously updated and includes case

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,869
studies on the deployment of open source

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,940
software within public administrations

00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,799
and country intelligence on open source

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,679
software policies and initiatives within

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,090
European countries it will soon be

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,069
enriched by guidelines for creating

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,060
sustainable open-source communities

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:17,739
within public administrations the open

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,330
source software country intelligence

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,060
reports are a key feature of the

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,490
knowledge Center the reports detail

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,620
governance medical and legal frameworks

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,480
and any major ongoing initiatives

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,760
pertaining to open source software in

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,390
the 27 EU Member States and the United

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,849
Kingdom

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,470
our initial desk research findings are

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,659
being validated by national contact

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,549
points providing expert feedback on the

00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,370
status of open source software policies

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,840
in their home country at present the

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,670
publication of their reports is ongoing

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,840
but we are happy to share our findings

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,879
from all 28 countries today let's move

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,799
on to the core of this presentation a

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,260
brief overview of open source software

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,450
policies in 20 euro peein countries

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,480
please bear in mind that this is not a

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,180
full analysis rather an inventory of two

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,430
aspects public sector bodies addressing

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,530
open source software and political and

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,930
legal initiative specifically addressing

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,280
open source software across Europe we

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,760
will publish a more detailed report

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,500
within the next three months when we

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,750
look at the map we can see that nine

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,700
countries in total ranging from dark

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,680
blue to light blue have one or more

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,140
public sector bodies that address open

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,540
source software explicitly from a

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,370
policymaking perspective the country

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,470
shaded in gray did not have a public

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,470
sector body that addresses open source

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,209
software explicitly the role of these

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,639
bodies with regard to open source

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,380
software responsive very encompassing

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,760
broad ranging functions like

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,579
coordination implementation supports

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,410
endorsement and policy making there is

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,359
one country with three public sector

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,430
bodies which is Belgium where we

00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:56,919
identified the Flemish role une and

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,930
central entities the singular body in

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,849
each region has the responsibility of

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,269
acting as a torchbearer in addressing

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,340
open source soft in countries where -

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,560
public sector bodies address open source

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,680
often these bodies may have varying

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,690
roles in Sweden for example the agency

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,639
for digital government is responsible

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,380
for the functions related to policy

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,349
making and adoption of open source

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,389
software meanwhile the Swedish national

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:25,060
procurement services with various

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:28,240
initiatives endorses and promotes the

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,550
use of open-source software in Denmark

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,229
the UK and France one body is

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,449
responsible for open source software

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,490
playing a leading role working to

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,320
implement and support open source

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,440
software and their public

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,100
administrations

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,530
for instance the French

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,320
within the inter-ministerial directed

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,610
for digital services or denim works to

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,770
implement open source software

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,640
throughout government administrations

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,110
and coordinates these efforts a research

00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,210
found that while some countries have

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,190
multiple bodies responsible for open

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,040
source software the functions of these

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,870
bodies do not overlap rather the clearly

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,890
defined role of each body seems to

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,420
ensure that their work is complementary

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,070
we have just looked at the number and

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,350
roles of publics like their bodies with

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,210
regard to open source software this

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,410
slide shows the specific breakdown of

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,900
the types of entities that we identified

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,790
so there are six agencies in total all

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,710
of which are responsible for the

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,330
oversight and administration of all

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,180
policy matters pertaining to the

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,570
digitalization of government opens our

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,650
software falls within there women's

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,230
ministries are comprised of various

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,840
offices directorates Secretariat's and

00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,850
others within ministries we identified

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,190
six entities addressing open source

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,740
software when looking more closely for

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,300
instance within the front denim a table

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,250
is active in supporting French

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,470
administrations in the opening of their

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,470
source codes and the use of open source

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,420
software it Arab also hosts a repository

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,510
of open-source software that can be used

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,780
by public administrations in Italy the

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,520
Ministry of technological innovation and

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,860
digitalization has entrusted the digital

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,290
transformation department responsibility

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,790
for open-source software one core

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,460
project of the department is the

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,620
developers italia website run by a

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,480
community dedicated to the development

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,020
of open-source software solutions for

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,510
italian public services a research

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,900
identified for services in Belgium Spain

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:29,030
Sweden and the UK for example the

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,460
Spanish Technology Transfer Center is a

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,950
directory of reusable applications and

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,120
solutions available to all Spanish

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,980
public administrations now I would like

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,590
you to take a look at the two post-its

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,290
clarifying our definitions of legal and

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,270
political initiatives legal initiatives

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,210
are parliamentary resolutions

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,590
laws directives and decrease and all of

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,530
them are legally binding

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,450
political initiatives our guide

00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,460
declarations governmental programs and

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:03,050
strategies which are not legally binding

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,060
the map offers an insight into the

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,580
country's legal and political framework

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,190
for open source software we identified

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,560
14 countries which have political and

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,870
legal initiative specifically addressing

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,520
open source software 11 further

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,190
countries were found to have political

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,830
and legal frameworks that address open

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,420
source software within the broad

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,820
digitalization initiatives aspera

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,830
research 3 countries did not seem to

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,400
have any political or legal initiatives

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,830
addressing open source software we

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,040
identified a total of 94 initiatives

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,590
which 26 focus specifically on open

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,050
source software which represents 28

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,230
percent these are in the countries shown

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,300
in dark blue the countries in light blue

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,030
were identified as having published

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,370
national strategies for digital services

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,450
acts that include the promotion of open

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,420
source software and public

00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,370
administrations among others based on

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,200
our research these political and legal

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,960
initiatives are usually part of the

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,980
general digitalization efforts of

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,780
countries here we have clustered the

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,510
most common domains that the initiatives

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,600
address for legal initiatives we have

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,790
identified two main clusters the cluster

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,490
under development and use of open source

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,560
software solutions consists of the legal

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,570
initiative that we identified that

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,550
encouraged public administration to

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,610
create their own open source software

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:31,160
for internal use we found two pieces of

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,169
such legislation and France the decree

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,450
specifies the types of open-source

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,979
software licenses that can be used for

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,070
administrative documents that are

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,560
communicable and reusable in the 2012

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,450
aro circular defined general guidelines

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,690
for the use of open source software and

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,010
public administrations a cluster on the

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,560
adoption of open source software

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,020
includes specific solutions that public

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,030
administration should adopt for specific

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,210
guidelines on how this should be done as

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,070
part of their policies or action plans

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,900
based on our research we consider this

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,030
to be a key cluster for open source

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,010
software because the initiatives in this

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,020
call cluster : public

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,860
regions to implement open-source

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,930
software as an example in 2013 the

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,970
Italian code of digital administration

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,890
made it mandatory for Italy's public

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,290
administrations to use open source

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,760
solutions as well as the phrase consider

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,660
reusing already developed solutions

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,600
let's now look at the political

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,160
initiatives based on our findings there

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,840
seem to be many more political

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,910
initiatives now legal ones as

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,100
demonstrated by the numbers next to the

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,590
clusters these findings lead to the

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,570
emergence of two new clusters we chose

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,480
to showcase some of the most recent

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,760
initiatives the open source software

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,520
procurement cluster highlights national

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,800
documents dot based on our findings set

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,480
guidelines on how to firmly include open

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,580
source software public tenders and

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,390
fairly consider open source against

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,940
proprietary software for example in 2019

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,320
Italy's agency for digitalization

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,480
published guidelines on the acquisition

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,850
and reuse of software and public

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,800
administrations these guidelines provide

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,530
instructions on the reuse of open source

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,820
software solutions and standards

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:17,210
incorrectly choosing them according to

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,740
meets the cluster under promotion of

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,690
open source software includes the

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,600
various political initiatives that we

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,760
identified by : public administrations

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,670
to use open source software without

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,460
however providing a specific program on

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,160
how to achieve this for instance

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,650
the open source software policy of 2019

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,170
was published by the Mata information

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,240
technology agency it encourages the

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,770
adoption of cost-effective open-source

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,080
software solutions throughout the

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,820
Maltese public administrations and I

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:52,040
something under EU PL is also favored

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,290
within the development cluster the 2018

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,210
French contribution policy for free

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,920
software of the state defines the

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,900
conditions for public servants looking

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,660
to contribute to open source software

00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,040
created by third parties and encourages

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,310
the publication of new software

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,230
developed by the government looking at

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,940
the cluster and the adoption of open

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,370
source software we see that Denmark

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,790
source municipality published an action

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,310
plan in 2013 the municipality adopted

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,450
this action plan as a continuation of

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,709
its efforts to the

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,529
open-source policy after the overview

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,110
from Vivian you might well be wondering

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:31,730
what's going to happen next

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,589
firstly we will publish all country

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,230
intelligence reports by the end of June

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,300
2020 and gather additional feedback by

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,800

additionally we aim to publish the full

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,699
consolidated overview on the status of

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,680
open-source policies in European

00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:48,920
countries so keep your eyes peeled for

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,630
