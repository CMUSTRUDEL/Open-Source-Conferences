	( Open Source Observatory (OSOR) Team - European Commission )
The objective of this presentation is to briefly present the country intelligence reports on open source software policies within the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom. Produced as part of the Open Source Observatory (OSOR) of the European Commission, the reports provide an overview of the governance, political and legal frameworks as well as open source software initiatives. We will focus on two aspects: public sector bodies addressing open source software and legal and political initiatives specifically addressing open source software. Our presentation will also include insights on key governmental bodies and strategic players involved as well as examples of the political and legal frameworks addressing open source.
