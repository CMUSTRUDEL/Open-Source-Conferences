	Software Development at Scale: Lessons learned from a pandemic lockdown and Open Source Ecosystems
( Jose Manrique Lopez de la Fuente )
2020 has started intense for many countries. It's been just a few months, but the things we have lived make us feel like it's been years. Covid-19 pandemic has hit everywhere and forced many people to work from home. If you were lucky enough to be in one of these modern companies that have adopted digital transformation years ago, would that be a problem? Many people have thought it wasn't, but it has really been. And what about the rest of the software developers involved in companies not ready for remote work at all? It's been said that nothing has boosted more companies' digital transformation than covid-19. But, are their managers ready for such change? Managing software development at scale is not an easy task, and this pandemic has disrupted the way projects are being developed in many companies. During this talk, I would like to share lessons learned from open source development at scale that might help companies to adapt to these changes. But more specifically, lessons about how software development analytics help managers to understand collaborative remote work.

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:17,460
so thank you very much allow me allow me

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,920
to present to you today in this house w2

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,740
online conferences I think it's the

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,220
second tenant talking here this time is

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,680
online I hope also to join in the all W

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,500
to community meeting it's going to

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,290
happen in November this with the best of

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,210
all I'm going to talk today the topic

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,760
for today for today's talk actually is

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,059
about several development at scale and

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,129
the idea is to talk about how we could

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,010
we kind of loose lessons we can learn

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,590
from open source software to apply in

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,770
our open in our organization whatever is

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,219
so far that's been development and let's

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,219
see we can be more resistant and release

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,140
resilient to this lockdown and pandemic

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,589
situation that we could be facing in the

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,439
future as we said that the internal

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,119
formation is here to stay when this this

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,890
was from originally from had Twitter I'd

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,080
see I saw some time ago and it was

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,790
interesting to the answer about who is

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,960
leading the digital formation in our

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,840
companies it has been his CEO the CTO or

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
not he has been the cop in nineteen has

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,840
just new reality that means we have

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,280
changed and now everybody in East yeah a

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,180
digital company to face all these

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,710
situations so let's back to what stated

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,000
the formation and the thing is nobody

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,799
has it very clearly so I been taking the

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,860
Wikipedia that is usually the source of

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,560
information I use and I have found that

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,750
the person they say basically

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,360
deformation is about using IT to solve

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,659
problems by problems I understand that

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,909
is huge problems I understand they are

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,890
basically my problems my company produce

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,560
my customer problems any problem

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,649
the or any situation I face on in my

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,360
lifetime is basically would be developed

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,459
by ourselves using technology at some

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,480
point so that's the detailed information

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,800
DX or DT situation so how companies are

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,170
adopting this

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Etan transformation for many of them is

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,530
basically means more technology more IT

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,290
environment companies are becoming IT

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,030
companies or even developing or

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,030
customize existing software for their

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,680
own needs that means that IT teams are

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,530
becoming more and more important for

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,090
these companies you know this has been

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,120
said a lot of basically software is

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,300
eating the world and now everybody any

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,120
company is becoming an IT company and

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,610
that again this means okay my IT team is

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,350
one of my most important asset or

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,740
resource in the company so if we should

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,510
taking care of it so first question how

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,340
do we measure IT teams delivery

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,890
performance how I know that they are

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,900
working how they are working but there

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,970
some set of metrics that are well-known

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
light delivery metrics that this one

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,620
example of methods we are providing for

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,650
some customers in our case using open

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,390
source basically to deal with ok two key

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,390
aspects that are important for companies

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,280
and people that is stability we want to

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,280
release stabilize with quality code and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,130
the throughput I mean I want to release

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,260
new features and bug fixes without with

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,720
pace just to be sure that everything is

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,070
is done with enough frequency to

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,350
innovate and have new features in the

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,600
market but again the question keeps

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,970
there is basically these new metrics

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,160
that help me retain and talon and have

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,080
committed IT teams because here is just

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,080
measuring performance what about the

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,660
people allotted the relationship of the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,900
people do they really help to face

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:56,130
Kovach 1910 issues like burnout stress

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,610
and all these situations well the sad

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,340
news is this economic form from 20 this

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,130
working on big form report from 2016

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,730
said that 70% of employees say they were

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,040
disengaged at work and that's a lot next

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,720
question how to my organization look

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,519
like because probably the issue is there

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,970
and I have realized that many

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,640
realization to play silo they are silent

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,710
organizations things working in

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,930
different business units both

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,120
geographically and even under different

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,570
sectors of business sector

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,570
vitamins so discreet this feeling of

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,360
silent rainy season and inside outs are

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,880
quite bad for companies because they

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,330
just destroy trust basically people who

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,550
spend time with the same kind of people

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,370
on the same amount of people they start

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,830
to get the rest distrust with other

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,229
people or other teams of course they

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,810
could any communication because you are

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:57,960
more easy to talk with people close to

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,660
you and that through the foster of

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,600
complexity blocks in any innovation in

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,280
the company so when we are looking at

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,380
what open-source software

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
look like how these projects how they

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,680
look like

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,630
ok first of all they've been there for

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,419
more than twenty years working remotely

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,449
and distributed and basically this DVD

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,729
in the sense of diversity of people with

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,979
a culture of collaboration creating

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,690
things and here you have for example the

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,010
mudsill a foundation environment with

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,240
all the projects there and all the

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,010
people participate in them

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,349
and it's not only of course you can see

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,320
the big bubbles like Firefox or mdn or

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:36,450
Thunderer but you can see all of these

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
small dots that are connecting all these

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,120
projects and our people are

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,979
collaborating in several place at the

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,039
same time those circulating so instead

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,349
of I would say knowledge across the old

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,090
organization allows the organization to

00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,500
innovate faster because basically you

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,940
can take the knowledge of this player

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,930
and not play them and build something

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,250
new and I mean the way there and

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,349
specifically we look at ok how these

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,169
projects this important place has been

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,510
before and after Covey 19 I mean how

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,970
they were one year ago for example

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,280
whether they were the patterns on what

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,990
they look like now if we look at the

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,210
Linux kernel we can see that basically

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,680
they are performing the Centers of

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,520
patterns that basically people is

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,530
working weekly and there's the same

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,430
amount of commits per week so basically

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,699
this is no big change kubernetes I would

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,620
say quite similar all the place in the

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,360
patches over foundation altogether are

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,250
performing quite similar there are some

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
spikes probably because specific theme

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,080
but not ready with the common probably

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,930
or even develop as an organization that

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,830
is doing this develops EE or develop see

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,420
project

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,450
basically they are performing about the

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,980
same so live rate is another example are

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,020
here and so comparing the time to

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,550
respond something to first attention and

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,170
then you can see that the numbers are

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,270
quite similar for the last three months

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,850
or last four months compared with the

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,880
whole last year so again nothing seems

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,020
to have changed just little slides

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,360
changes prodding the time to start

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,980
working and stuff like that I would say

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,540
for deeds it has been an stressful month

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,120
probably because people husband out

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,130
interesting in this kind in this tool

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,730
for example for doing calls and then you

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,950
can see from much many new issues how

00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,250
they have been attending lately our

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,350
corner but again it seems that they are

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,660
the Cillian at some point so how could I

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,690
apply all these options or develop

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,040
methods inside my company and some

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,930
people say ok there is something called

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,030
inner source Pro you can apply that this

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,700
is this is what it would be and you know

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,730
what what is this inner source thing and

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,190
it was Tino Riley on 2000 that coined

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,830
the term energy sources to use open

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,380
source development techniques within the

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,510
corporation and what does it mean what

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,670
this is about - open source is about

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,340
releasing code what what what does it

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,950
mean so I will explain this - what is

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,980
not inner source from our experience and

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,990
this means we have in our company well

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,730
this isn't source is not open source I

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,380
mean it's not releasing publicly your

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,830
code and there are licensed and read in

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,930
a community bad it's mean transparency

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,790
internal in your company it means that

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,340
you need to allow people to work in

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,500
different plates inside your company it

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,060
means that people will have this kind of

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,280
governance models and all the stuff so

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,560
you need to understand more is how how

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,960
could be the issues to do this of course

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,390
is not agile scrum or your favorite

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,550
Development Authority even waterfall and

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,960
I mean it's not against any of them

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,630
basically it's something completely

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,000
different and it's morally the culture

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,430
and the values you want to provide build

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,040
on your company but it has also some

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,440
principles related with agile screw and

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,220
like that principle like culture

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,110
communication transparency collaboration

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,760
community and meritocracy basically you

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,260
can read about them in the pathway that

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,110
is the way a petition from the Sun

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,660
defined the

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,490
of their projects of course it's not

00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,960
easy you can imagine all the situations

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,160
you need to face like okay what about

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,440
NDA's with my employees what about what

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,450
kind of code I can show to anyone in the

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,900
company what kind of Cobra is not ready

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,090
for that

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,920
well what is the governance model all

00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,390
this stuff how I gonna allow people to

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,270
work in different employees how it's

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,950
going to work and it's not easy there is

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,900
a foundation a community is the energy

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,020
source common foundation is an European

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,060
foundation that the aim is to create a

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,590
body of knowledge around inner soft

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,330
practices so I would recommend you to

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,940
look for it because they are doing a

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,120
great job and it's not new as I said

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,950
because the Turkish is from 2000 but the

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,540
companies in the foundation are very

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,520
well known and this these people are

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,100
applying inner source internally and

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,600
it's not only about IT company one

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,300
nowadays everybody should be an IT

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,520
company but you could recognize some

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,560
trained German North American companies

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,680
that are clearly not known because they

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,990
are an IT company like Marlene I don't

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,080
know surrond Oh

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,640
Comcast boss they are doing quite

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,700
different things there and it's not only

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,950
just go yeah so how do I know if any of

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,450
these practices are working if I put

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,340
them in place in my company and I will

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,260
Suzy ok let's start by something simple

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,820
is more player I would like to let

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,890
people work on it because it's something

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,820
that it would be interesting for the

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,860
company so how do I know if I'm sorry my

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,240
phone I work in a data analytics company

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,570
and I believe we strongly believe that

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,240
without data you are just just having an

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,100
opinion and not real me real fats and

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,450
again you we have all these metrics that

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,060
we explained in the beginning about the

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,440
delivery and stuff like that so that

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,540
should be something the other we can

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,410
case and we can use to know if this

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,290
thing is working ok for for that we are

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,210
doing usually as material with companies

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,400
friend partners is basically applying

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,840
this analytics metrics strategy they

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,220
basically start with the strategist

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,990
understand what the goals of the company

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,450
what do we want to achieve when doing

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,790
this inner source software and then

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,950
let's go to the analysis phase that we

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,960
basically build the questions we want to

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,600
solve and then once we have these

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,819
questions now where we can get the

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,160
formation from we've got the

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,740
customization of data analysis tool that

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,230
is free of all in the case of Italy

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,209
other one we are using from there we are

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,550
reporting all this information to the

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,110
many years and the sea level that are

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,139
interesting on knowing what's going on

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,819
there and read with what can be measured

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,949
ok there are a lot of things that you

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,870
can measure but I will focus on at least

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:33,180
the questions you can answer like how

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,699
many people are attracting attracted by

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,959
deployed Zion building in my company how

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:40,170
many people are you starting to

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,870
contribute how these people number of

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,069
people is growing in terms of is the

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,829
company or the project sorry the price

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:48,480
wrong in terms of contributors what's

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,790
the role of these contributors are their

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,980
core developers regular developer as

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,480
well developers what's the level of

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,639
engagement they have with the pride and

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,130
again was the relationship just to see

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,019
if I am really really in the side loss

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,630
that was the inning of this initiative

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,850
for sure and there are some iterative

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,759
with the processes like okay once the

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,870
engagement I saw what the world lot who

00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,759
is been put there

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,589
how many commits how many to how they

00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,019
are involved all these all these things

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:19,410
of course the lifecycle of the price

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,380
they prayed just active is young

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,060
declining or it's just a new player is

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,459
getting out of hype internal in the

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,019
company is their fair play between the

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,000
people when they are working different

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,550
teams just how the things are being

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,949
soulful deal with I've been in the same

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,259
way these are matters that I think I

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,540
interesting to have and again it's about

00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,730
how we are played in applied and in this

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,389
process I explained before it is a cycle

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,180
and a set of cycles they end up using to

00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,490
approach the goals of my company or my

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,269
priorities this again is the way to

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,730
proceed some conclusion just to end so

00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,189
worried teams are from my point of view

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,680
one of the most valuable resources in

00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:04,079
modern organizations and they may be be

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,500
measured by part of the metrics that

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,319
matter

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,269
salute organizations block people to

00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,269
reach their potential and we need to

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:15,779
allow three people to to let them grow

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,899
and it has all the potential open serpro

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,040
yet seem to be resilient to this copy 19

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,430
situation are merely

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,079
with any of these situations so energy

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,459
source could be the pattern I think is

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,490
the path to apply open-source culture

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,889
inside organization so once we have all

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,649
of these again we believe that the

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,110
data-driven risk I mean so data-driven

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,600
energy source management is possible

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,529
under these risk fosters innovation and

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,050
of course Foster's organization success

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:48,420
so that was all from my side it's more

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,709
slide about bit idea what we do and just

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,389
some soon information about all the

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,519
charts that have been so in the in this

00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,680
town has been done through an open

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,329
source tool that you are free to use

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,910
that is called on the dial you can go

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:01,730
there and start playing with it if there

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,470
is any question on time for questions

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:08,389
discovery this is our my details for

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,389
