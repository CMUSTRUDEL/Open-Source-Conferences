	Software Development at Scale: Lessons learned from a pandemic lockdown and Open Source Ecosystems
( Jose Manrique Lopez de la Fuente )
2020 has started intense for many countries. It's been just a few months, but the things we have lived make us feel like it's been years. Covid-19 pandemic has hit everywhere and forced many people to work from home. If you were lucky enough to be in one of these modern companies that have adopted digital transformation years ago, would that be a problem? Many people have thought it wasn't, but it has really been. And what about the rest of the software developers involved in companies not ready for remote work at all? It's been said that nothing has boosted more companies' digital transformation than covid-19. But, are their managers ready for such change? Managing software development at scale is not an easy task, and this pandemic has disrupted the way projects are being developed in many companies. During this talk, I would like to share lessons learned from open source development at scale that might help companies to adapt to these changes. But more specifically, lessons about how software development analytics help managers to understand collaborative remote work.
