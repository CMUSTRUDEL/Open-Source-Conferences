Description: 
	FOSSology is an open source license compliance software system and toolkit. As a toolkit, you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and Web user interface provide you with a compliance workflow. License, copyright and export scanners are tools used in the workflow. FOSSology is license under the GPL, it is therefore available for anyone to facilitate license compliance tasks. While FOSSology provides the license analysis for individual OSS components, the Eclipse OSS project SW360 is a software catalogue to provide a central place for managing and sharing license information about software components used by an organization. It is designed to neatly integrate into existing infrastructures related to the management of software artifacts and projects by providing separate backend services for distinct tasks and a Web application to access these services.
