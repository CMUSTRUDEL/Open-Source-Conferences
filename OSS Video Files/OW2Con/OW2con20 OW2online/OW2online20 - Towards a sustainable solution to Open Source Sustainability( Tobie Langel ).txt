Title: OW2online20 - Towards a sustainable solution to Open Source Sustainability( Tobie Langel )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	A few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M. It was soon revealed that the root cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based. In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,680
are you familiar with this logo

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,520
it's the logo of the heartbleed bug the

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,560
heartbleed bug

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,920
a critical bug to open ssl the library

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,199
responsible for

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
cryptography for a huge portion of the

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
web

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,760
this bug by itself um cost

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,640
um the industry roughly half a billion

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,079
dollars

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,000
among other issues like um compromising

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,960
the confidentiality of over

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,120
4.4 million u.s patient records

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
it was a pivotal moment for the tech

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,920
industry

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
where it realized that open source was

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
ubiquitous

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,399
critical and grossly underfunded

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,359
at the time of the bug

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,119
openssl had a single maintainer

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,040
operating on the shoestring budget

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
of two thousand dollars per year

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,320
this led the industry to really

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,320
consider sustainability of open source

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,479
infrastructure in which it depended as a

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,840
critical issue

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,960
and in order to do to try to fix a

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
problem a number of

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
efforts were launched one of the first

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
one was the core infrastructure

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
initiative

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
that was organized by the linux

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
foundation it was a multi-million dollar

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
fund

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,840
whose goal was to harden the security of

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,000
key open source projects

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
um the focus of um

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
the core infrastructure initiative

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
however was very much to prevent a new

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
hard blade

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
and not to make open source as a whole

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,840
more sustainable

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,159
so maintainers took manners in their own

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
hands notably avenue

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
who leveraged patreon the site

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
originally aimed at artists

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,680
musicians and writers to create a

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,040
meaningful revenue stream for himself so

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,800
that he could work on vue.js

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,720
full time he was able to make roughly

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
seventeen thousand dollars per month

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,239
from

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,720
uh patrons um but unfortunately this

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,800
model

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
hasn't really been reproduced by other

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
maintainers

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,640
or at least not successful at that level

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,920
of success

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,959
uh another initiative um uh uh

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,879
that you know tries to make open source

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
most sustainable is get coin

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,200
so get coin is first a github issue

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
market

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,959
that allows project owners to add

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
bounties to github issues

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,280
um and devs then get to submit their

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
workers pull request

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,400
it has distributed in 2018 half a

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
million dollars of bounties

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
and what's interesting is it's a whole

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,599
ecosystem which includes an

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
ad network called code fund

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,599
the point of code fund is to allow open

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,000
source maintainers to

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,840
add contextual ads to their open source

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
projects

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
essentially focused on hiring other

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,560
developers right

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,440
um the code fund has been making making

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
roughly ten

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,680
thousand dollars in monthly revenue and

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
um

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
and has been able to redistribute about

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
of those

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,879
open source um is also has also been

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
taken

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,440
notice by venture capitalists and

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
there's even a dedicated fund right now

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,680
called oss capital

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
that funds companies that are building

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
their business

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
on top of an open source project

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
another really interesting initiative is

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,920
open collective open collective

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,920
is a startup that provides non-profit

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
status to open source projects which

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,400
otherwise don't have a legal status and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
also helps

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
providing transparency as to how funds

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
are used

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
uh its biggest success story to date is

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,720
webpack which has reached

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
in 2018 four hundred thousand dollars in

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,239
early funding has

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,560
has that increase uh ever since um

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,199
it does however suffer from a long tail

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
project in 2017

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,919
a quarter of total funds were actually

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,720
given to webpack

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,160
and so to fight that open collective has

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,479
created backyo stack

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,720
a software that lets companies not only

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,800
understand what open source projects

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,199
they're directly relying on

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,680
but also the recursive dependencies of

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
those projects

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
that's very similar to what tight lift

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
yet another

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,880
project is trying to do tightlife is

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,160
essentially red hat business model but

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,639
for the long tail

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
it provides security updates maintenance

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
and legal insurance for all open source

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,280
projects in an organization's

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,160
stack and it does that by actually

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
paying the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
maintainers of these projects to do the

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,479
work

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,720
it's a lot newer though so we don't have

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,160
a good success story to share

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,720
yet um

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
warning ahead though all of these

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
different

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,919
efforts really

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,800
can't by themselves address the whole

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,360
issue of sustainability of open source

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,479
um and that's because there just are

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
limits

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,360
to what we can do with funding alone

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,360
um and you know to we'll look at four of

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,600
those key limits the first one is

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
whether funding actually scales all of

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
the way that we want it to

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
the second one is whether money is

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,039
actually the problem

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,080
the third one is whether we're

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,160
funding to work would

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,319
and be able to fund open source by

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,440
itself would that be a desirable

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,800
outcome in itself um

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,000
and lastly we'll look at what the real

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,720
value of open source

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,720
actually is and whether um

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,400
we're not really leaving money on the

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,520
table

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,240
by focusing more on code than

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,800
on every other aspect of open source so

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
let's get started with scaling first

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
this is a hundred dollar bills a hundred

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,639
dollars bill

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,360
if you um stack a hundred of those

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,080
uh together you get ten thousand dollars

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
which is the

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,520
monthly revenue of code fund the ad

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,720
network i mentioned earlier

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,360
um a hundred of those and you get a pile

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,280
that's worth one million dollars that is

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
the amount collected by open collective

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
in a year

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,080
roughly and is also the amount that

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,880
titleit has committed to pay back

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,440
developers off of the 20 million that it

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,560
received in funding

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,280
let's compare that to open source

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,479
developers

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,599
and sorry to the worldwide population of

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
developers

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,080
um roughly speaking we have 12 million

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
full-time developers

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
about six million part-time and roughly

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,599
another four million

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,479
that are non-professional if we do

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,440
quick back of the envelope math uh we'll

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
realize that

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,599
um you know if we amount if we account

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,880
for 65k

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,919
for uh 65 000 for um

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,039
annual salary um for the

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,919
12 million full-time developers and 35

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,880
000 for the six million uh part-time

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,599
developers

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,599
uh we're roughly at an envelope of one

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
trillion dollars in

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
wages only not accounting for anything

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
else

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,479
for developers worldwide

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
now let's compare that to the one

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,039
million dollars that we're actually

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
spending on open source

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,360
and put those two in perspective so if

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,560
we um

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
take a hundred of times one million

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,879
dollars

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
and put that on the palette we get a

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,639
hundred million dollars

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,240
take ten pallets together and when we're

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
now at one billion dollar

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,680
build a ten by ten square of

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,800
uh pallets and we have ten billion

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
dollars

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
to get to one trillion dollar and watch

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,479
the truck for scale

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
we actually have to stack a hundred of

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,000
those

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
on top of each other

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,440
and that gives us one trillion dollars

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,360
you know if we go back to compare it to

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
the one million dollar that opened so

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
open collective is giving open source

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,920
for example that tide lift

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
is committed to give back to maintainers

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
we realized a huge discrepancy

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
that there is between the money that's

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,440
spent on open source

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,320
compared to the money that is

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,320
um used to pay developers worldwide

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,399
let's now look at the second question is

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
whether money is even what's missing and

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,279
there's a really interesting chart here

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,279
that shows us

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
the percentage of

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
linux kernel developers that are

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,279
employed full-time to work on on linux

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
kernel

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,880
and we realized that you know this is

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
more than the vast majority this is like

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,040
close to everybody and so this is

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
extreme for the linux kernel but this is

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,480
a data point that we can see

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,000
across the board the problem

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,480
isn't money the problem is time

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,240
spent by developers working on open

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,880
source

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
all right let's uh ask the third

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,760
question which is

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,959
would that even be a desirable outcome

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,959
right do we want a future with charity

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
funded open source developers on one

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
side and corporate developers writing

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,240
glue code on the other

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
and i think there's a really interesting

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,360
answer from dhh

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,640
uh the creator of ruby on rails on this

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
and i'm just going to read

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,959
an article part of an article he wrote

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,040
in 2013.

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
part of the reason much of open source

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
is so good and often

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
so superior to closed source commercial

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,560
projects

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
is the natural boundary of constraints

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,480
if you're not being paid or otherwise

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,399
compensated directly for your work

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
you're less likely to needlessly

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
embellish it

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,519
you're solving the problems for you and

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
your mates likely in the simplest way

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
you could

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,920
so you can get back to whatever you

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
originally intended to do before

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
starting to shave the yak

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
so basically what dhh is saying here is

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
that there's

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,600
um clear benefits to actually

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,640
having engineers work in open source

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,720
rather than rely on

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,800
someone else to be building open source

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,320
software for them

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
which brings me to my fourth and last

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
point what is the real

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,920
value of open source and now we're

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,720
leaving money in the table by optimizing

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,880
for the wrong thing here

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
so the way we tend to think about open

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,279
source is

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
um we look at corporations on one side

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
and open source developers on the other

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,200
and we just assume that

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
corporations are using open source

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
software

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,079
in that set and so when we have a

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,959
sustainability issue

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
we just essentially expect corporations

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,480
to

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,800
throw money at the project to fund uh

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,160
the open source software

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,519
um and you know get the developers to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,360
contribute more

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,880
so that the corporations can then um

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
leverage that value more effectively and

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
and

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
and better in practice though everyone

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
anyone that's been paying a bit of

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
attention to open source realizes that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
the

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
real value the real strength of open

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,839
source is

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,200
in the community and the relationships

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,200
and the byproducts of those

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,399
relationships and of that work

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,519
that are that happen within the

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
contributors

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
right and so in practice while

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,639
corporations believe that they're

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
actually um benefiting from

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,680
open source and really capturing its

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,480
value while

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,399
that value is going away with these open

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
source developers

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,880
bringing that value back with them to

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,800
the companies that they're working with

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
and so the question then becomes well

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,360
how do you capture that value

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
and the answer is to stop looking at

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
corporations as like

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,399
entities but to realize that they're

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,800
actually full of developers themselves

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
right and not only can those developers

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,519
contribute to open source

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,680
they can also benefit from that

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,440
incredible network and the community

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
that is built around an open source

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,320
project

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,600
and that is how they can then

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,760
bring back value to their own company

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,200
through best practices improved

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,639
understanding of the software that they

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,279
use

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,279
leveled up engineers etc etc

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,680
so in conclusion what we can say is that

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,399
charity-like funding of open source

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,040
alone is not the solution

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
the real way forward is to normalize

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
engineers

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,079
contributing to open source as part of

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,480
their day job

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,600
how do we do this we do this by making

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,160
organizations

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,160
understand better the return on

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
investment of contributing to open

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:47,920
source

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,920
