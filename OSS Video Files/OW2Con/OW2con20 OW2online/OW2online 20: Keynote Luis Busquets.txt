Description: 
	The ICT domain is certainly the fastest moving sector in the economy. The late developments in the XX century seemed to bring a world where the step to produce new innovation would become locked to new entrepreneurs and only those controlling the previous innovations would be able to produce more. However, Open Source has changed this paradigm. Today, we see how Open Source Software has succeeded everywhere but in a way that was not foreseen neither by its advocates nor its detractors. The world is now in the verge of a digital industrial change and Open Source Software and Hardware will be game changers in this (r)evolution.
