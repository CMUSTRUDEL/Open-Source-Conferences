Title: OW2online20 - XWiki: A web development runtime platform( Vincent Massol )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	When developing a web application, the traditional way is to develop the application from scratch using a general purpose language such as Javascript, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, etc. This presentation will show that a next generation wiki (examples based on XWiki: http://xwiki.org) can be used as a web development platform to develop applications on top of it, providing a strong infrastructure scaffolding to building web applications. The advantages are similar to those of using an application sever. However whereas an application server offers technical services only, a wiki platform offers higher level services such as content management, rendering, storage, WYSIWYGeditor, user management, and a lot more. Not only are these services offered, you can develop using them in your traditional IDE or in the runtime, directly in wiki pages. This allows developing web applications extremely quickly, collaboratively and with a fast turnaround time, which is perfect for adhoc web application development.

[Music]

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,580
talk about ex wiki as a web development

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,000
runtime platform so I'm Vincent myself

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,300
from the XPS ice company and I'm also

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,779
one of the open-source Committee on the

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,109
ex weekly project so today my goal is to

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,329
try to present XP in a different light

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:35,579
some of you may know it as the wiki as

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,950
an advanced wiki but I would like to

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,660
show you and demonstrate that you can go

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,290
further than that and that you can use

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,020
it as a development platform so let's

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,000
start so what do we have for today so I

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,190
want to first to show you that xvt is

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,890
not a wiki it's a lot more than that

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,020
then we'll see what we can develop with

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,699
ex wiki then we'll talk about the

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,430
development model to see how it's done

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:05,280
in practice and we'll conclude with some

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:07,650
pros and cons of using it so why is ex

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,590
wiki not a wiki so actually it is a

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,780
weekly of course but that's just one

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,350
usage so what you see on the screen is

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,729
an example of using X wiki as a standard

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,189
wiki this is what you get if you

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,900
download it so by default it's a

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,900
structural open-source enterprise wiki

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,490
that is ready to be used you don't have

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,040
any development to do you can just use

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,220
it as is but but and that's important

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,590
but it's also a platform for developing

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,060
any type of content based web

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,270
applications so under the hood it sits

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,860
on top of a servicecircuit container and

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,790
XP key exposes a lot of services more

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,460
than 700 actually and those are business

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,960
services they're not technical services

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,009
like a logging service but they also

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,439
business service like a WYSIWYG editor

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,090
the ability to do configuration the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,099
ability to have a blog application

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:12,360
scheduler watch lists skins attachments

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:15,450
store etc custom metadata and

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,560
more so all those services are exposing

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,600
api's that you can actually use yourself

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,580
you have access to them but and they

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,360
also exposed for some of them they also

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:33,360
expose you is so wiki pages and you is

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,350
then your own application can add your

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,570
own services developed either in in Java

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,360
for example or inside wiki pages

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,850
themselves and of course your

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,300
application can also provide content

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,830
pages as wiki pages but you sit on top

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,880
of this platform and if you have access

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:58,230
to those 700 types of services and api's

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,870
so what can you develop with xwiki

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,780
knowing this so I'm going to show you

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,270
some example of things that were done

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,880
using those API dimension so first one

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,150
is collaborative website so this is a

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,610
you see it doesn't have a look of a wiki

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,010
it looks more like a website however

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,440
when you go on some pages like this one

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,590
the one you see you can there's a little

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,280
pencil button or several actually here

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,280
and you can I click on edit for example

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,190
and if you do so then you are actually

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
editing the page to a wiki page with

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,780
some structured data as you can see it's

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,049
not just plain plain text data so there

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,850
is a D the detail part is the plain text

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:45,420
but then you've got also the themes who

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,709
got the the video apart etc so this is

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,430
where you find it with the engine

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,239
underneath but it's completely even as a

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,820
website and with a custom UI another

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,310
example of what you can do that wiki is

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,519
this and others website called quickie

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,410
and which allows to write courses

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,450
collaboratively several teachers can

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,519
group together and write a course for

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,799
students and again you can see on the

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,950
screen when you edit a page the

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,870
structured concept where you can have a

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,169
lot of different type of metadata and

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,560
there and then having some scripts and

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:26,210
some UI to present this metadata

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,860
scream another example is an intranet so

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,590
you see yet another look that's very

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,790
different ability to search on the

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,220
homepage to list the last items and then

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,840
go on a specific page it doesn't look

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,290
like a wiki but they still have the Edit

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,960
icon for example the pencil the pencil

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,720
button and if you edit it again you can

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,960
edit things using a form view for

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,770
example here so those are three examples

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,080
of use cases but they are a lot more you

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,590
could use you could use XP key to do to

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,229
write a CRM contact application and HR

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,440
recruitment app some project management

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:11,270
are for product documentation meeting

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,580
notes blogging calendar etc the sky is

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,010
the limit and really and what I would

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,169
like to show you is an example so this

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,810
is a list of screenshot of what users

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,990
have done with ex wiki so this is found

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,020
on xwiki dot or website it's I just

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,570
wanted to show you the variety of us and

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,120
and use cases that users have done and

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:36,530
this is because of this capability of

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,100
the runtime development platform so

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,770
let's see how it works underneath so a

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,280
standard application that you develop

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,000
normally using a traditional traditional

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,370
way that means using Java PHP node.js

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,110
etc is that you've got libraries so

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,560
building blocks plus all the blocks on

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,020
the left and you're writing code to a

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,090
sample table block together to do

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,100
something and to generate an executable

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,030
and the binary that is your runtime that

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,479
you can then run and do something and

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,210
you iterate over this there's a steps to

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,860
produce your application so this is

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,389
traditional way but with like sweet

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,200
leaders that it's a different paradigm

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:23,870
is you start with a runtime this is the

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,210
EDX wiki that you download and it

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,760
already offers those building blocks

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,919
that are stitched together to make

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,380
something that works and that runs and

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,290
then what you can do is you can read

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,750
place any of those blocks or add your

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,670
own blocks to it so that it matches

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,920
exactly the application you want to have

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,990
that means you don't start from zero

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,680
you start from having something that I

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:52,160
love authentication that has ability to

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,030
edit to edit content and ability to have

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,190
for example his history of the content

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,310
define store but I can store any type of

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,680
data in the database etc so those are

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,690
the blocks and you can remove or add

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,510
blocks till you get your application

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,340
that you want to have so let's see what

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,870
you can change now what are the blocks

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,950
what are the types of blocks that you

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,340
can change so capabilities are so you

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:22,190
are for example the ability to create

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,620
your own metadata inside the wiki so

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:28,630
let's say you want to represent a

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:33,470
customer for example with no function

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,240
name etc so you can create those in wiki

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,850
pages we'll see a little bit later how

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,960
to do that and then you can use them in

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:45,020
various places in other pages and then

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,670
you've got scripting a very strong

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,280
scripting that you can use in wiki pages

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:52,490
themselves we support a lot of scripting

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,070
languages like velocity groovy Ruby

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,500
Python etc and you've got access to the

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,600
food API you remember I was mentioning

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,320
at the beginning that you had like 600

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,260
or 700 so this is an API so those are

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,900
all the API have are accessible in

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,100
scripting from new wiki pages no

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,170
actually a lot of them I'm saying oh

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,780
that's partly true but the majority of

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:20,750
them are accessible you can of course

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:23,380
also create Java code that access them

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,330
and then make this code available from

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,430
scripts in wiki pages I'm not going to

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,780
go there but that's that's also possible

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,890
and then of course in term of UI you can

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,740
change completely the look and feel

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:40,039
change the skin change the theme inject

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,490
any custom CSS and JavaScript in wiki

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,440
pages directly in wiki pages which makes

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,960
it extremely easy to customize the look

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,910
and feel

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,800
of any pet or the full website

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,260
completely as you've seen in the

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,540
examples just before and we've got a

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,490
concept of extension managers ability to

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,390
load/unload

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,890
extensions in your wiki so--but it could

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,480
be though your own extensions or they

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,240
could be extensions developed by others

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,770
that you can use or remove if you start

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
with xwiki from scratch and there are

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,320
some extensions that you don't need for

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,370
your project

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,810
and you can also remove them so let's

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,970
dive into the metadata because that's

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,680
very important if you remember the the

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,959
home page of ex wiki that I was sharing

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,060
earlier so there are different parts but

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,690
what's important is that so this is the

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,580
UI part but what's important is beneath

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:33,029
the data displayed are coming from

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,120
custom metadata so typically in a wiki

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,890
the metadata you have is the title and

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,529
the content that's very typical all

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,470
wiki's do that now xwiki go much further

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:46,170
because they it allows you to define

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:48,420
custom metadata like for example the

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,450
comments here you see this is it says

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,300
hello w12 2020 that's custom metadata

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,880
all the panels of content this are

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,420
custom metadata now they've got titles

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,980
also by the way but this is all custom

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,800
so let's see how it works let's take the

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,220
example of the comment so there is a

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,720
page in the wiki called xwiki dot x wiki

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,520
comments here and it defines the

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,709
structure of what a comment is for

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,740
example so you see a comment as an

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:20,580
author of type list of user does a date

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:24,570
of type a date it has the comment itself

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,510
of a type X text area etc it can have a

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,540
number for the reply the number the

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,430
number of the replied corresponds to etc

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,890
so this is a structure definition of the

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,870
structure or metadata and then in a

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,089
witty page any wiki page you can

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,610
actually add an instance of that

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,010
structure to that page and this is the

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,550
example of the home page where where I

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,020
put an instance of that structure and

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,390
you see it is filled with the author

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,520
being the administrator the date is the

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:57,959
one set here and the comment is the one

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,300
I was reading before and then of course

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,420
so you've got

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,970
so you now have metadata inside a wiki

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,300
page and then whisks for scripting you

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,790
can access this metadata and I render it

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,710
the way you want in the example here

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,090
there is some scripting that displays

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:20,210
the comment on the screen as a section

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,250
has a part below the content on the

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,290
screen now you could also do it directly

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,030
inside the content you could have access

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:31,550
to this metadata and say whatever you

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:33,920
want in your page content so that's very

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,990
important because this is really that

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,660
allow what allows to develop those

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,730
applications because what we don't see

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,440
here is that this metadata that you

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,220
create it's automatically saved in the

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,930
database with a normalized model of X

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,030
wiki so you don't need to take care

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,070
about that all you need to focus on is

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,410
the definition of your content of your

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,810
metadata your structure and how to

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,750
access it and how what to do with it and

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,430
what to display in the UI or what to do

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,410
with it it doesn't have to have a

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,630
display you could do other things also

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:10,970
like send an email or whatever so let's

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,680
move on I mention about scripting so

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,420
scripting in wiki pages I wanted to show

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,880
you what it looks like so this is an

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,500
example using a velocity script so

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,470
velocity is a templating language very

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,540
simple one so this page is written in in

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,420
a syntax in xwiki syntax and with markup

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,420
syntax so if you really very quickly

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,480
what I've highlighted are the the API

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,510
calls for example here if we follow it

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,340
it says so it defines a variable X wql

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,200
that says we're all dot content like

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,730
something welcome so that and then it

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,220
calls services that query that

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,830
excitability execute so this is actually

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,870
running a query on the whole wiki on all

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,730
the pages and it finds all the pages

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,780
that have a content having the welcome

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,590
string in it

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,660
okay then request so that's asking the

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,570
request if there is a confirm

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,420
query string parameter that is equal to

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,800
1 ok so when we when we execute this

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,020
page the first time it doesn't have that

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,060
it goes to the else so it is blow a

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,910
bullet list

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,130
the all with a list of all the pages

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,420
that welcome in in their content and

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:23,540
then it it creates a link this is the

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:27,140
link syntax with a typed with a label of

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,820
replace welcomed by the Avenue and when

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,160
you click the link when you click this

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,660
link sit course the same page passing

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,399
confirming called wall as the core

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,529
string so that means the second time

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,260
this page executes it goes to the if

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,830
here inside so it gets the yet sweetie

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,899
that get document it gets the document

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,870
for each of the item that ask welcome in

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,760
them in their content it modifies their

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,580
content gets the content replace all

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,130
welcome by the afternoon so to translate

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,230
it in French and set it as the new

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,370
content and then saving the the page

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,830
with a message replaced the Avenue and

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,890
then it displays a bullet Steiner and

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,010
saying replaced off for this page so

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,920
that's a simple blast to show you about

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:15,800
what it looks like of course I'm showing

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,230
only if you are course API code course

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,910
here but you've got access to to

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,620
thousands and tens of thousands so

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,570
actually hundreds of thousands of api's

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:29,390
you've got the full power at your

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:32,690
disposal here now in terms of UI you can

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,970
also inject anything in a wiki page you

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,310
can inject any type of CSS on it at any

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,740
type of JavaScript you can inject that

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:43,510
for the current page you can inject that

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:47,680
for all pages in the wiki or on-demand

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,930
etc so you've got a lot of options

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,750
incidentally if you look here we

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:56,329
actually using twin shot of custom

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:59,240
metadata so it's the same injecting CSS

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:02,540
is using a custom data metadata defined

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,270
as a stylesheet extension page that has

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,670
the structure and then so you just need

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,310
to add this object to your page of this

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,579
type and boom suddenly you've got the

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,339
CSS injected for this page or all pages

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,709
on the wiki etcetera through the the use

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,620
this extension parameter below plane for

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,540
example in same for JavaScript

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,690
so this is the this is a very nice and

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,690
simple way where you can can inject

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,940
arbitrary CSS and JavaScript very easily

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,540
in the wiki because you just save the

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:40,070
page and then boom it's applied very

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:42,290
easy last that I want to show you in

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,199
terms of the development model was the

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,300
extensions I mentioned 700 extensions if

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,760
you go to extensions that xpeke it out

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,560
or you've got access to all of them you

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,079
see as of today there are seven hundred

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,790
and seventy six of them and they can be

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,040
anything could be a blog application

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,490
meeting manager application form and

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,579
LDAP authenticated JIRA macro etc there

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,990
are they are really really a lot so

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,959
those extensions are done by the

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,250
community and the accessible to you if

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,339
there is one that you need to develop

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,329
your your app we can use it but of

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,860
course you can develop your own

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,380
extensions you don't need to publish

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,149
them there but they are available to be

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,010
installed directly inside your wiki

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:29,990
through the extension manager of X wiki

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,459
so conclusion with disability we can

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,959
actually code a lot of different

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,140
application in next week and if you look

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,750
at the old some of all the applications

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,970
that exist in the world this is infinite

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,209
because every day when you come to work

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,920
you want to do you repeat things like

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,570
you want to take data from one side

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,940
combine it with a mother do something

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,680
and you keep doing this manually but

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,510
through X wiki you've got a very easy

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,670
way to automate that and create a very

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,800
small application very quickly because

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,779
you've got the runtime running and you

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,459
just need a few concepts to learn a few

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,040
concept and boom you've got an

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,740
application that does things that are

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,250
custom to you and if you had to develop

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,459
it with standard development process

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,400
like from Java from scratch or PHP or

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,470
whatever you will need a team of

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,860
developers and it could take quite a

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,839
while to do it and what we what we're

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,140
saying is that with next weekís model

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,970
the the morphing application model you

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,030
can very quickly reach your goal much

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,870
faster and with a lower cost and this is

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,270
actually an

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,340
enabler to developing the very small

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,050
application that maybe our one-time

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,450
application to develop and that you

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,309
wouldn't develop otherwise so this is

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,030
why we call X wiki the excel of the web

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:49,940
because X Excel is a very versatile tool

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:52,850
that we've all used with the macros etc

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,340
so this is X 6 PT is really the excel of

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,930
the web in the sense that with it you're

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,150
able to do the same thing that Excel is

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:03,380
doing with data but this time with web

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:06,890
applications so what are the main

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,630
advantages by by doing the things the

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,640
way I've mentioned with wiki pages and

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,530
reading pages you've got an iterative

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
lead based development that means you

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,750
start from day one with adding something

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,080
and iteratively you modify your wiki you

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,660
move it to do things that you want so it

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,080
keeps working every day as you progress

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,270
and you progress along your application

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,980
that you want to have

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,650
it's neat base because of course it's

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,850
you don't need to make big plans from

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,610
the beginning and wait a long time

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,530
before seeing something you can decide

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,660
as you progress about what you want to

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,580
have it depend and get the feedback of

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,470
people using it and suddenly you realize

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,360
that ok people are using this way so I

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,990
need to do that and then you refactor

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,340
and you modify and it works and you've

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,770
got your application that is a little

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,940
bit better and different than before

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,500
they know it's that's why it's

00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,000
continuous delivery it's version because

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,040
you based on the weekly engine so

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,450
everything you do is version that means

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,450
you were bringing the concept of

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,700
versioning content to application

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,530
development you can see the changes in

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,200
the application in this in the script

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:17,540
for example do a diff see what has the

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,760
lowest on what revert etc yoke so you

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,500
also can work collaboratively because

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,260
you can be seven to eight different

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,120
pages and work on the application the

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,990
developers can work on the JavaScript

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,820
and all the CSS while the the advanced

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,040
users who are developers are not set

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,960
developers because you don't need to be

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,690
a full-fledged developer just advanced

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,530
user is enough can create the logic and

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,760
reuse it you can use the existing api's

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,290
that's how it works from the one I

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,460
mentioned that so you got immediate

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,710
feedback it's orange

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:54,259
of course and completely open source and

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,899
community-based development so we I'm

00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,149
not going to enter here but we've got a

00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:02,330
governance that allows equal opportunity

00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:04,669
for anyone on t --xv kid on tour website

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,950
so if you want to know more just go to

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:09,259
