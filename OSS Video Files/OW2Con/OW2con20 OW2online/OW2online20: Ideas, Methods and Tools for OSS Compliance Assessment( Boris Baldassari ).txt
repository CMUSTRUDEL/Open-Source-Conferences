Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	While Open Source Software has become mainstream, the understanding of its key principles, from ethics and collaboration to governance and community management, is gaining more interest and attention. There is a comprehensive volume of studies and reports backing up our individual and collective experience, yet we still cannot reliably measure these characteristics, and even less clearly define or assess them. In an attempt to build up confidence and foster maturity in this area, this talk will look at the various existing models and metrics related to OSS compliance and governance, and build upon them to propose methods and tools for their evaluation and analysis. We will discuss the requirements and essential questions to ask, offer guidelines for implementation and suggest efficient ways to present results.
