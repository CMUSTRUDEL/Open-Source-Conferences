Title: OW2online20: Ideas, Methods and Tools for OSS Compliance Assessment( Boris Baldassari )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	While Open Source Software has become mainstream, the understanding of its key principles, from ethics and collaboration to governance and community management, is gaining more interest and attention. There is a comprehensive volume of studies and reports backing up our individual and collective experience, yet we still cannot reliably measure these characteristics, and even less clearly define or assess them. In an attempt to build up confidence and foster maturity in this area, this talk will look at the various existing models and metrics related to OSS compliance and governance, and build upon them to propose methods and tools for their evaluation and analysis. We will discuss the requirements and essential questions to ask, offer guidelines for implementation and suggest efficient ways to present results.

[Music]

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,389
hello good people thank you for joining

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,029
this talk about ideas methods and tools

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:22,830
for open source software good governance

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,570
assessment since this situation is quite

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,359
new for most of us I'm going to

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,269
introduce myself quickly so my name is

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,759
Bob is baldessari I live in Dijon in

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,680
France where these stork is recording I

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,440
work as a software engineering

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,450
consultant for castelia solutions and

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,460
I've been working in the field of

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,539
software development methods and tools

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,210
for more than 15 years now I had the

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,520
opportunity to work on several software

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,989
quality and maturity assessment projects

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,879
including the process maturity

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,090
assessment initiative for the Eclipse

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,520
Foundation for 5 years ago and also a

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,989
couple of research projects like mezcal

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,210
or cross miner in this presentation we

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,580
will discuss good governance for open

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,549
source software projects and what it

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,509
means in our context from OSS core

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,220
principles to community and process from

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,790
there we will define a set of quality

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,040
attributes corresponding to the various

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,780
principles of good governance and we

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,049
will organize the screech attributes

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,750
into a quality model then we'll propose

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,020
an implementation of this quality model

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,780
that goes from the quality attributes to

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,210
the metrics that we use to assess it and

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,689
then we will conclude and give a couple

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,689
of references

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,740
as an introduction we need to set the

00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,930
goals of this talk our main goal is

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,409
simply to note our discussions on the

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,970
topic provide a couple of references but

00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,759
more than that we want to be practical

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,070
we want to propose a consistent semantic

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,909
framework as a starting point for a

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,450
proof-of-concept we will propose simple

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:13,599
yet effective measurements and a way to

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:17,470
really implement them but that needs to

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:21,750
be improved and extended of course in

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:25,150
order to achieve this we are looking for

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,299
practical solutions even if the scope is

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,060
not complete even if we know that the

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,890
measurements we do are not the best but

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,650
we want to simply start something and

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,750
then improve it in order to do that we

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,330
will also rely on existing existing

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:44,580
technologies and tools that will enable

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:48,010
us to start an immediate implementation

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,709
our first step on this journey is to try

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,239
to define what good governance is for us

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:57,100
in this context a good first step for a

00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,810
good governance definition is probably

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,340
to have a look at the OSS core

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,570
principles because there are a

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,739
foundation for all the OSS projects and

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,600
the community that surrounds them the

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,970
three key factors that we have

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,120
identified for that in our context is

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,450
firstly openness and transparency of

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,340
course the project must have all the key

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,200
tools and processes publicly available

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,930
there must be also documented easily

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,139
accessible

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:35,170
the second key factor is ethics at the

00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:38,470
core of the open-source community there

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,840
are a set of guidelines and rules things

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,870
like a code of conduct or the presence

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,430
of escalation procedure which allows

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,889
people to easily report toxic behavior

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,440
things like diversity inclusion

00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:56,360
initiatives both at events and in the

00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,350
day-to-day life of the of the projects

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,150
factors - finally a good practice of

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,160
open source of the project is to provide

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,620
the documentation to help people adopt

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,880
the product and project documents like

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,250
the user guide

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,570
Renea getting started or development

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,060
guidelines like contributing file

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,980
another major area of voices good

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,859
governance is the community of course

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,340
because it really is what will make the

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:28,400
project successful and sustainable we

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,220
defined three major characteristics for

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,650
the community of open source projects

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,390
firstly the diversity we need people

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,419
from different backgrounds and companies

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:40,940
if if some company of some individual

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:43,100
want to pull off the project then we

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,120
need the project to still be able to

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,730
have commits pull requests accepted

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,680
ducts corrected and so on so this really

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,680
increases the sustainability of the

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,050
project and it's also a founding

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
principle of open source software let's

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,729
say is given enough eyeballs all bugs

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,100
are also that really also increases the

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:09,770
reliability of the products another

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,590
characteristic is the activity we need

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,310
activity because activity means that

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,960
there will be more bug fixes more

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,600
evolution more new features put into

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,410
into the product another characteristic

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,880
we want to measure is the support our

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,830
responsiveness of the community

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,550
regarding ants pharaohs to posts and

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,880
bugs and the time to resolve feature

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,010
requests bug fixes and so on it's a

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,169
defining criterion for participation and

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,540
engagement and it's also defining

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,940
criterion simply for the adoption of the

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,510
products the community growth and the

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,310
sustainability of the projects now let's

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,490
have a look at the processes of good

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,830
governance which is the politics and how

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,919
decisions are made to drive the project

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,210
to its success or failure we want to

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,419
notify three key areas regarding

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:08,479
processes the first one is about IP

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,590
cleanliness that's very important to our

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
users

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,090
especially at the corporate users we

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,460
want to have license checks third-party

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,620
dependencies checks IP cleaning

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,650
procedures like individual contributor

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,360
agreements and things like that secondly

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,640
how decisions are made in the projects

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,790
this one is tough because how can we

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,290
tell if the the process is democratic is

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,200
it a good thing it can be either

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:41,660
meritocratic or it can be a benevolent

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:44,150
dictator or model so we want to know how

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,790
decisions are made and we want to make

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,810
sure that the decision-making process is

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:54,380
transparent last but not least it's

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:57,500
about engagement which is how we enable

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:01,160
people to collaborate and participate in

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,100
the projects this is a two-way street in

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,650
shape we need to let the people in and

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,120
make decisions for the project and we

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,580
also need to listen to their requests

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,980
but there are many quality models and

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,920
initiatives about product quality or

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,280
process quality in the literature not so

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,340
many of them target the good governance

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,740
we have identified two groups working on

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,410
this very topic the first one of course

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,860
is the W to good governance working

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,450
group which is quite new but very active

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,370
initiative to develop and promote the

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,540
use age and sharing of free and open

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,930
source software government best

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,530
practices the second one is the Linux

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,230
Foundation calls working group it's an

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,020
older mom nature and very active

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,540
community working on community health

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,120
metrics they have several working groups

00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,560
including common metrics diversity and

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,540
inclusion evolution risk and value as of

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,430
today the debate and reflection within

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,400
these groups proves to be really

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,550
interesting but the results can hardly

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,600
be put at work mainly because most

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:18,350
metrics actually need human assessment

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,530
judgment of things now that we have

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,610
defined our measurement course we need

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,949
to organize the quality attributes

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,630
in a quality model and link them to

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:33,479
metrics why do we want a quality model

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,060
well there are several benefits to using

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,909
a quality model firstly it provides a

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:42,570
common cementing framework so people can

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:46,070
discuss it improve on it secondly it

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,800
almost instantly provides direct key

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:52,230
indicators to the user and if someone

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,190
wants to drill in some specific details

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,339
they can easily do so finally it's a

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,230
good way to put the model at work by

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,350
linking the quality attributes to the

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,060
metrics we can apply this assessment to

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,000
a real-life software project and

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,380
aggregate the mirrors and populate the

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,300
model it must be noted however that the

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,640
quality model needs to be thoroughly

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,070
documented from quality attributes to

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,800
metrics the goal here is to provide a

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:26,820
semantic foundation to all users to

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,990
start elaborating on the concepts and

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:34,020
the murderers and the quality attributes

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,720
regarding the OSS core principles what

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,130
we essentially wants to do is to make

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,040
sure that we can easily get the

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,990
information and then actually retrieve

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,740
the information which means that it is

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,630
directly available so for the openness

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,480
and transparency we want to make sure

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,690
that we have access to the tools needed

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,579
to collaborate with the project to is

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,560
like configuration management tracking

00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,899
system which she knows integration

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,600
mailing lists we also want to make sure

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,270
that the values documents related to

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,970
ethics and collaboration are available

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,399
things like code of conducts escalation

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,720
procedure readme license contributing

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,520
guide and so on the community of an

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,010
open-source software project is a bit

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,589
unknown quantity since we have a lot of

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,380
metrics and tools available to extract

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:28,440
these metrics towards like grimoire lab

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,650
or anomic as an example regarding

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,620
diversity we are the number of actors

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,200
involved on the - tools for the projects

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,950
regarding the activity we have the

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,500
of contributions made on the specific

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,750
period of time say three months and

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,170
regarding the supports the number of and

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,690
direction and responsiveness time

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:55,980
transfer on the main lists or books and

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:58,470
so on can be used as well the process

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,660
part of the quality model as expected is

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:05,639
a bit harder to assess and measure we

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,920
can check the IP cleanliness with tools

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,470
like scan called dependency checker for

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,519
Saleh G or we can even use commercial

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,279
tours like Pallavi da for for that and

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,230
then we would reuse the results and

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,170
incorporate them in the in the quality

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,680
model in the aggregation the

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,300
decision-making and engagement

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,800
characteristics are the real tough guys

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,930
here as a first shot we can try to see

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,660
if the governance model is documented

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,850
and if it's accessible we can also check

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,320
if the minutes of the meetings and

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,269
committee is publicly available for the

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,790
engagement and participation of the

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:51,029
community we can analyze the repetition

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:55,260
of activity and use value statistic tool

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:57,779
to see how well the activity the

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,980
contributions are spread among the

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:05,130
contributors this quality model has

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,709
actually been implemented in Olympic on

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,589
this picture we can see from left to

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:13,130
right the main quality attributes which

00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,050
is a project good governance maturity

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,470
subdivided into three main categories

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:22,019
OSS core community process each of this

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,050
category is tends to divide it into our

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,569
quality attributes information openness

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,569
it takes collaboration activity

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:34,589
diversity support until your property

00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:36,389
management decisions and engagement then

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,730
for each of eight of these quality

00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,930
attributes we have a set of metrics that

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:47,250
will be aggregated from the roads to the

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,680
top to build up the quality model

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,930
anomic is an open-source data management

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,350
platform for software development

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,689
projects for each project we will define

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,329
a set of plugins that will target the

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,879
various areas and tools of the project

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:06,300
who want to follow for each of these

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,339
tools Arabic will create a bunch of

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,949
metrics that then will be used to

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:14,069
populate this collision model I don't

00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:16,379
make also provides analysis and reports

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:22,079
about the various areas and tools that

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:24,569
it analyzes the first draft of what good

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,899
governance report could look like is

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:32,730
shown here we can have a list of checks

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,889
that are done on the device tools we

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,730
have a link to the various documents

00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:41,939
that have been found we could also have

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,819
tables and graphics showing how the

00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:53,579
project is major or not regarding the

00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:56,699
good governance okay let's conclude this

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:59,009
torque is a naive attempt to build a

00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:02,279
workable proof of concept for OSS

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:05,329
governance assessment nevertheless it

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,579
works the quality model is definitely

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:12,300
incomplete and could obviously be

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,759
enriched with new metrics new

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,879
measurement goals new key areas of

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:23,519
concerns probably also better assessment

00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:26,430
tools using natural ingredients in the

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,860
new novel technologies we could also

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,899
enrich the reports because it's not only

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,600
about providing numbers on the quality

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,269
model it's also about providing a link

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,579
to the documents and providing learning

00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,059
to the various results that can be

00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:44,699
exploited the result of this experience

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,279
has been implemented in Colombia and is

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:50,430
freely available online please check it
