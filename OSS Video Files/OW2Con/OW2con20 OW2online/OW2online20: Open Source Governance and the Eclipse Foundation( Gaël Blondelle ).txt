Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	In this talk, we will cover two complementary topics: * The different Eclipse projects related to Open Source governance, like Eclipse SW360, SW360 Antenna, and Eclipse Steady, as well as the opportunity to leverage SW360 as the core of a larger Open Source governance initiative. * The Eclipse IP Process that has been applied to hundreds of Eclipse projects for more than 15 years and is going through a modernization process that involves both simplification from the developer point of view, and openness to new sources of trusted data like Clearly Defined.
