Title: OW2online20: Open Source Governance and the Eclipse Foundation( GaÃ«l Blondelle )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	In this talk, we will cover two complementary topics: * The different Eclipse projects related to Open Source governance, like Eclipse SW360, SW360 Antenna, and Eclipse Steady, as well as the opportunity to leverage SW360 as the core of a larger Open Source governance initiative. * The Eclipse IP Process that has been applied to hundreds of Eclipse projects for more than 15 years and is going through a modernization process that involves both simplification from the developer point of view, and openness to new sources of trusted data like Clearly Defined.

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,429
I'm bein on there I'm managing the

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,080
European activities of the Eclipse

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,250
Foundation and I'm Vicki Christin

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,240
development at the Eclipse Foundation

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,060
and thanks to Michael Shawn Corbit our

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,529
manager in church for faculty who was

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,730
instrumental in preparing this

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,769
presentation and let's jump into what we

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,380
do as if this foundation in terms of IT

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,989
management since the inception of the

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,620
Eclipse Foundation in 2004 IT management

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,070
is really one of our core services our

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,660
main goal is to allow adopters to use

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,140
source code download it from their

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,020
servers in their commercial contexts

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,629
including in their products that relies

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,149
on a rigorous due diligence process that

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,989
checks both project code returned by

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,600
commuters and contributors as well as

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:07,170
third-party libraries and of course this

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,990
process involves several legal documents

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,240
including the IP policy and several

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,060
legal agreements for Co materials etc I

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,799
will not describe that and details now

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,689
but you should know that it's well

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,130
documented and that you can access all

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,310
the documentation at the Eclipse

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,340
severals and VT what I want to discuss

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,810
more is that in the last 12 months we

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:38,850
have improved our process to make it

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:44,700
more agile and to stay to still focus on

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:47,880
the risk induced by bad open-source

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,000
compliance but the point is that

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,390
previously we could not support agile

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,350
development processes because the full

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,149
due diligence process was too lengthy to

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,430
give an answer to the developers and

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,719
they had to go through this full due

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,860
diligence process before they got in

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:15,040
order to get the green light

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:19,120
who to use a third party sub party

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,920
library for example so we wear to some

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
extent to blow terror in their wardrobe

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,550
now we have more lightweight and

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:33,150
automatic process and also we will

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:36,250
faster project project velocity and

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,410
everybody is happy that we managed to

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,280
reduce or the administrative stuff how

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,480
does it work

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,560
so first the point here is the focus on

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,380
self party libraries and in terms of sub

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,690
party libraries we want to check the

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,610
compliance so that the licensed

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:05,290
companions of those sub party libraries

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:08,739
so we identified whitelist of licenses

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,440
that can be safely integrated in Eclipse

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:15,940
project and this list has been approved

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,370
by myself Kidd Board of director and we

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,299
provide two projects so capability to

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:26,560
self validate the IP during the

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:29,530
development process and so they they can

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,459
include new sub party in their in in

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,630
their development and and don't need to

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,640
go through the CIP process to do that

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,010
but when they want to do a formal

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:47,830
release then they need to go through a

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:50,080
full IP clearance process so that's that

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,160
really we are not in the middle of the

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,100
development process but we put the focus

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,390
on the on the release because that's

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,040
that's when we we know that project will

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,829
create artifacts that will be

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,310
redistributed by adopters so that's when

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:12,150
it's more important to check your IP so

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,989
something new is that in

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,660
- our Zilla database and come back to

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:24,810
that we we use more sources of of

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,699
licensing information and that's that's

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:32,639
what's described on this on this side so

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:35,940
high PG da first that our own database

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,539
with more than twenty thousand records

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,240
and that's that started back in two

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,350
thousand four and that set contains a

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,139
world history of sir party dependencies

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,960
analysis from the beginning but in

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,240
addition to this database we are so used

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,940
clearly defined which is an OSI

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,180
initiative so clearly define worlds by

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,419
collecting license information from

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:08,030
different means like maven and PM etc

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:12,060
and and and using a curation process

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:16,830
with crowdsourcing to make sure that

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,570
this data is can be trusted and the

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,060
Eclipse Foundation is a proud

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,610
contributor to contributor to clearly

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,199
define in especially in the context of

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:32,970
the unsaturation process in Eddie in

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,780
order to to apply those sorts of

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,570
informations we created a specific

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,630
command line interface tool that is

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,190
available on github and as he gives

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,940
public license and what this tool does

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:53,940
is that input it takes description of

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,690
your dependency graph typically the

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:02,190
output of modern dependency plugin and

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:03,919
it will check from each dependency it

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,340
will check the license information

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:11,490
available in IP Dilla available in

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,460
clearly defined and in this case we we

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,650
select only we accept only when the

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:22,590
screw is more than 75 and if it if the

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,430
dependency is license is part of the of

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,559
the whitelist

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:30,539
approved by the board of director

00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:33,809
and if everything is okay then that's

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,359
okay the the compliance has been checked

00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:39,299
automatically and in some cases can be

00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:41,869
checked fully automatically if there is

00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:45,889
some unresolved license information or

00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:50,309
some of the dependency has come with

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:54,199
restricted usage which is defined in our

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:58,049
rules it's like okay this component as a

00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,329
dependency as as a license that you you

00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:02,159
cannot use it in case of for

00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:07,049
distribution but for example you can use

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:11,909
it for for testing so if this is the

00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:14,129
case then the Eclipse IT team will go

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:19,169
through with both shows list and check

00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:22,289
it and in their due diligence test they

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:24,959
use some some tools like scan code and

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,599
foss4g and that's typically when they

00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:37,829
use clearly-defined or contribute to to

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:40,949
carry a file so just to conclude on this

00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:44,849
on this topic I will say that there are

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:47,219
some best practices in terms of open

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,219
source project management and license

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:53,999
compliance is mandatory that's that's

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:56,909
really something that must be at the

00:07:53,999 --> 00:08:00,839
core a core concern for open source

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:02,789
project leaders and from our protection

00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,729
that's that's really a collaboration

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:09,479
between the Eclipse Foundation staff and

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:13,289
the Eclipse project committees what you

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:16,709
need to do in order to to manage that is

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,169
you need to know your bit of material so

00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:21,859
you need to create your bit of material

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:26,939
to identify all the dependencies and

00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:30,689
also to maintain this this bit of

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,490
material and also you need to document

00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,760
license information

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,850
so using SPD X using nice

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,600
failures copyright and nice and setters

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:45,840
using copyright and license files in

00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,540
repositories finally I mentioned clearly

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,100
defined several times we we all believe

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,570
at the Eclipse Foundation that it's a

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:58,200
great initiative because that that makes

00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,630
the world more the more the world more

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,440
trustable for for the greater

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,180
open-source community in terms of

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,800
licensing information you know we have

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:13,380
to find it and you know the level of

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:17,120
trust we can expect as a conclusion I

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:21,150
would like to say that yes open-source

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,830
compliance is one of our core services

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,000
and wonderful duties at the actual

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,620
foundation but we also host some

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,140
interesting projects related to

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,020
open-source compliance I would like to

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:38,540
mention software 360 which provides a

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:41,580
free 360 vision around your software and

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,880
provides the capabilities to manage your

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,790
catalogue of your of your of your soul

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,370
of your own projects with your Bill of

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,830
material and the licenses and to

00:09:50,370 --> 00:10:01,020
identify license compliance issues

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:03,900
software specific antenna which puts it

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,170
in the continuous integration to chain

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,740
so that the developers know sooner

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,440
rather than later is introduced some

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,780
issues in terms of compliance in in the

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,570
process so we could software 360 was

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,000
started by Siemens and Bush is now one

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,510
of the contributors and software 360

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,560
antenna was started by by Bosh and the

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:34,260
last project is a Eclipse teddy from sa

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,750
P which as a focus and open source

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,110
software vulnerabilities so it will tell

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:44,540
you in all your dependencies which one

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,920
unknown to to bring you some some

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,660
security vulnerabilities

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,269
and in addition to that it will also

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,369
tell you how to fix those

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:57,509
vulnerabilities because they identify

00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:59,489
which commit fixed the security issue so

00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,279
they can tell you that if you move to

00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:05,639
the next version then it should solve to

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,889
solve the issue so that's three

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:12,779
interesting projects you can you can try

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:14,970
and thank you for listening I think that

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,279
open source governance is a key

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,730
component of open source adoption that's

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,040
a topic on which we are proud of what we

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,290
do to support our projects at the

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,720
Eclipse Foundation and that also topic

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,379
about which we think that we need to

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,869
collaborate with other foundations and

00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:36,299
especially otherworldly to created the
