Title: OW2online20: Open Source contribution Policies that don't suck( Tobie Langel )
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	Open source contribution policies are long, boring, overlooked documents, that generally suck. They're designed to protect the company at all costs. But in the process, end up hurting engineering productivity, and morale. Sometimes they even unknowingly put corporate IP at risk. But that's not inevitable. It's possible to write open source contribution policies that make engineers lives easier, boost morale and productivity, reduce attrition, and attract new talent. And it's possible to do so while reducing the company's IP risk, not increasing it. In this talk, we'll look at the general structure of contribution policies, examples in the wild, and tactics to make them suck less. We'll also look at how to turn these policies into self-service software, preventing the tedious email back and forth between engineering and legal in most cases and making open source contribution a breeze.

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,710
welcome everybody to this session about

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,560
open source contribution policies that

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,289
don't suck my name is Toby Langella i'm

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,720
the principal and unlock open a boutique

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,449
consulting firm that i founded a few

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,920
years ago and that focuses on helping

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:33,329
companies and organizations was their

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,030
open source strategy I usually start

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,129
this talk by asking the audience what

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,100
their open source contribution policy is

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,480
and whether they have one and obviously

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,980
today this is going to be a bit

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,190
difficult for me to do because this is

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,719
pre-recorded so here's data that comes

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,699
from a survey done in 2018 by a

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,789
collaboration between the new stack in

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,980
the Linux foundations to the group

00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:03,480
asking that very same question and

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:08,040
surprisingly for such a savvy group of

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,140
respondents close to half 48% exactly

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,540
that not know whether their company

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,670
actually had an open source policy or

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,990
not and that gets worse if you actually

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,210
ask you know segment the data and ask a

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:29,329
smaller companies like was some less

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:33,570
than 250 employees of course it gets

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:36,600
sorry way better and not more clear was

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,869
completed or you know large corporations

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,939
was over 10,000 employees but even then

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,220
I find it kind of surprising to to

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,490
figure out that a quarter of employees

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,890
of those don't know on whether they have

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:55,259
an open source contribution policy or

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,909
not and you know it's it's even more

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,360
concerning when you actually realize

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:04,350
that this is a super bias simple right

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,570
we've asked essentially developers

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,670
through channels like Alex foundation

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,900
the new stack which are you know very

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:15,569
open source savvy very tech savvy

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,360
um anyway that begs the question as to

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,330
what not having an open source policy

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,690
means you know you know that's best

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,450
answer them in my opinion in the words

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,690
of Heather Meeker one of the most famous

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,440
open source attorneys out there who

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,360
wrote you have a policy whether it is

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,220
written down or not right and that

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,069
policy could range from no open source

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,100
at all to anything goes what's important

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:48,090
to know is you know this policy exists

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,420
in any cases right so we well you have a

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,280
good sense of what not having one means

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,070
it actually means that you have one but

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,320
then it's not done explicitly now let's

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,470
look at what actually having a policy

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,940
means um and you know I'm sure you all

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,190
felt kind of proud to know that you're

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,989
completely there to have a policy well

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,450
it turns out that that's a good

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,400
condition but not a sufficient one right

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,500
you can have a policy but this policy

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,540
can be super restrictive it can be

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,769
highly bureaucratic it can be super

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,019
opaque and none of these are fun you

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,840
know so having a policy is not enough

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,380
right you want a policy and you want a

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,500
good one and I think the best way to

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,690
flow of looking at that is to graph

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,799
where you stand on them on a graph on

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,720
which the y-axis um you know in a four

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,870
quadrant graph in which the y axis goes

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,640
from implicit to explicit and the x axis

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,530
from restrictive to permissive if we

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,250
place a couple of like company types in

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:57,030
there we'll find small and medium

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,989
businesses to be in the permissive but

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:05,579
implicit sector right startups will tend

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,680
to be less explicit about things than

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,480
the small businesses and also less

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,100
permissive right which is normal occurs

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,130
they won't tend to be more product

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:19,590
focused non tech enterprise will be and

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,639
highly restrictive and generally sort of

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:27,810
like implicit a quadrant in

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,639
and that they will tend to just reject

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,039
up and twisting the block and not even

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,469
bother writing about it anywhere if you

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,650
move to the fourth quadrant this is

00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:40,289
we'll find the old tech companies you

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,889
know Oracle would be their old Microsoft

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:46,650
would be there and if you go with the

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,259
extreme top left you will find patent

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,229
trolls right extremely explicit about

00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,650
their you know what they're trying to do

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:57,689
here and super restrictive and of course

00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,849
the good place to be in the first

00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,740
quadrant which is explicit and

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,550
permissive this is where you will find

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,009
modern tech companies and at the top

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,120
right hand corner you will find

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:16,379
trendsetters let's have a look at the

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,879
life cycle of a company for example a

00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,330
start-up so what happens is a start-up

00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,240
well as I said it starts to be sort of

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,680
like implicit and restrictive and as it

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,699
grows into a bigger company well bring

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,310
in engineers from outside that were you

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,219
know that start to work on things that

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,699
are not essentially the core product

00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:43,589
anymore for example tooling or

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:47,029
infrastructure right in these engineers

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:54,830
will tend to be lots product focus and

00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:59,839
more focused on general engineering

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:04,649
practices and as a result we'll probably

00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,539
have a stronger open-source culture and

00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:12,569
it will tend to contribute contribute

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:17,069
more so whereas policy might not really

00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:20,539
become that more explicit um it will

00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:22,979
clearly become more permissive and then

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,870
there's going to be an event in the

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,469
company and that is going to

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,319
dramatically change the way that open

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:34,740
source is done and perceived at a

00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,470
company and that is could be a merger

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,860
could be an acquisition could be

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,680
a seed round it's an event that requires

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,080
the company to the startup that has

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,300
grown to put to make you know to clean

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,780
this house up and for that it's going to

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,860
hire its first IP council oh its first

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:59,580
council um you know the trend here very

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,610
unfortunately is that this will create a

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,780
ton of explicitness in the company but

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:11,730
will add a ton of restrictions around

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,320
practices this is unfortunate that all

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,860
too common what you'd like to see

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,310
instead at that point is more

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:26,670
explicitness absolutely but not at the

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:28,620
cost of permissiveness let's now look at

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,160
old tech companies like Oracle or

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,360
Microsoft from 2010 or so right these

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,560
where um restrictive explicit companies

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,190
in terms of open source and as they sort

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,180
of modernize and adopt inner source and

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,750
then more open source practices and in a

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,990
strong open source culture they will

00:07:50,750 --> 00:08:01,080
make their orbits woes policies more

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:03,660
permissive now tech enterprise which now

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,370
just you know has figured out over the

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,630
last decade that it actually has to

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:12,780
become tack or be displaced won't tend

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:17,040
to become more explicit with their

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:19,020
policies as they start building their

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,790
engineering engineering department and

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,530
in changing the engineering departments

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,110
name from IT to engineering yeah here

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,020
again you know the ideal path is not

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,690
just going up it's going in diagonal all

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,560
the way to them explicit in premise of

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,789
first quadrant alright so I think you

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,610
got the message the first quadrant we

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,760
have explicit and permissive open-source

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,680
policies is usually the best place that

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,610
you want to go to if you

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,250
or trying to build a strong open-source

00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:02,230
culture and an innovative engineering

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:06,279
driven organization all right let's now

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:09,130
look at what exactly is a policy that

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,470
doesn't suck and it turns out that the

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,570
perspective of what that means is going

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,330
to vary between engineering and legal

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:23,290
and business and so we're going to

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:27,040
briefly look at each one of those from

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,980
an engineering perspective a good policy

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,890
good open-source policy is one that is

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,470
permissive explicit informative and

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,220
frictionless and what do we mean by this

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,320
well permissive it has to allow open

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,230
source contributions to be part of

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,220
day-to-day work right it has to it has

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,890
to allow an open source practice to be

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,529
part of the engineering culture part of

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,040
the DNA of the company right and for

00:09:53,529 --> 00:10:00,160
that to work it means that engineers

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,740
need to be trusted and have autonomy

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,430
around this so the rules have to be

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,930
explicit so that they can make the right

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,360
decision when faced was for example

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:17,560
wanting to or having to patch an open

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:22,440
source project that they rely on um but

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:25,690
a explicit open source policy by itself

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,900
you know isn't enough we also want it to

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,020
be as informative right not only does

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,360
the policy have to tell you why you're

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,209
not you know what you'll have to do it

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,790
has to tell you why because that helps

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:42,930
educate engineers who are then able to

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,270
make better decisions next time and

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:50,040
bring that knowledge into the

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,990
decision-making process around you know

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,630
architecture for example what project

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,610
should we use knowing whether or not

00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,320
won't be allowed to patch it is an

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,890
important decision for an engineering

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,870
team to be able to make lastly of course

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,910
you want and

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,380
think to be as frictionless as possible

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,570
right avoid red tape back and forth over

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,660
email was way you'll just make it that

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,420
easy and super fast for engineering to

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,930
get an answer can I use this or do we

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,330
need to rely on something else from a

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,880
legal perspective things have been

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,279
different what is a legal thing to do

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:35,850
well essentially they want to minimize

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:39,390
risk right and what that means depends

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,810
on the project but and and the company

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,779
right but you know common concerns are

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,270
giving away competitive advantage giving

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,630
away IP that can be used defensively

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:54,420
right or even offensively avoid

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,670
reputational damages accidentally

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,370
infringing on the copyright of someone

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:04,560
else by including you know a copyrighted

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:09,390
image for example in the repository the

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,550
yogurt source the second aspect that a

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,130
company will companies illegal team

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,320
won't care about is that it is

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,410
consistently fold across the company

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,950
right there is nothing worse than having

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:27,810
a number of contributors being following

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,900
the policy in one part of the

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,640
organization and another set doing

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,880
something completely different somewhere

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,620
else right so what you want is to know

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,570
what's going on so that you avoid

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,230
compliance issues and the risks I

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,360
mentioned above as a legal team you'll

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,250
probably want to be savvy but written

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,990
information so you know some of the

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,480
things you'll want you don't want to

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,279
have in written for example have a paper

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,740
trail for compliance reasons and others

00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,600
you want for example to avoid tripping

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:03,470
damages for patent infringement and I

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:08,160
think most importantly of all what a

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:10,740
legal appointment will want is to avoid

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,380
drowning critical problems in a sea of

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,160
menial issues right some licenses can

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,440
kill your business

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:24,300
if you realize suddenly that your whole

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,550
business is based on a copyleft license

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,000
it's a critical piece of the software

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:33,180
you really you're relying on and you're

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,519
selling a software and you want to do

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,620
on-premise well you have a really really

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,439
big problem do you have that you have to

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,300
solve them suddenly right and you don't

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:47,550
want to be focusing on answering 25

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,069
questions around about permissive

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,240
licenses of the in developers are using

00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:58,199
for tool and I lose sight of like the

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,480
critical problem of like a more complex

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,480
license in a key part of your business

00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:09,120
what does business want well it once

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,970
essentially engineering to be happy

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,949
productive and innovative it wants the

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,470
risks to be minimized and what

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:18,240
understood it wants good communication

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,889
between the different organizations

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,079
especially legal and engineering in that

00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:23,670
case because good communication is

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,759
always better than no communication of

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,310
bad communication and of course it wants

00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,360
the open-source policy to be aligned

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,899
with business goals why is this so

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,730
difficult

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,850
well because at the heart of all of this

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,360
conversation is a huge tension between

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,880
legal they wants to minimize risk in

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,029
engineering that wants to maximize

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,459
velocity right legal that has an oral

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:54,209
culture engineering that has a written

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:56,519
and asynchronous culture legal that

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,920
tends to fully manage with schedule

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,550
whereas engineering tends to be in the

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,819
makers schedule legal that has more of a

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,649
spectrum thinking right in law

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:10,769
everything is in the gray area it's

00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,860
never yes or no right and that you know

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:16,230
is a real distinction was sort of like

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,300
though very binary thinking they often

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:25,559
see in engineering and lastly illegals

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:29,110
roll is conservative whereas engineering

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:33,720
is in innovative

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:38,620
and so how do you make these two really

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,830
conflicting cultures come come to

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,540
agreement well first of all you have to

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:47,440
acknowledge that this tension is normal

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,730
wait it's checks and balances it's great

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,770
to have these two in your in your

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,380
organization you need these two these

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,030
two different perspectives they help

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,020
drive your business in the right

00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,580
direction and so as a business leader as

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,300
you know as an organization we then what

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,220
you want is a listen to both sides you

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,570
want to remind both sides that their

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,920
role is to achieve common business goals

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,200
legals were always to minimize the risks

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,960
sure but that cannot be at the expense

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,970
of innovation likewise Engineering's

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,550
needs can't be fulfilled the expenses of

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,110
the company's survival so what you want

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,600
to do here is really find a common

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,400
ground and a good policy would actually

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,230
improve the life of both sides

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,870
um and lastly I think you have to to

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,870
also really understand that your policy

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:42,700
has to be aligned with business goals

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:44,590
you can't have a very premise of policy

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,090
if you're essentially a path control

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,100
that doesn't make any sense right and

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,110
your engineering department has to

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,610
understand that this is the company that

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,410
they have signed up for um and lastly

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,560
you know as part of that you have to

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,960
understand that your policy won't change

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,230
with your business if you are startup

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,390
and you end up an incumbent you know two

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,089
decades afterwards while you open source

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,490
policy what I have seen many many

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,230
revisions and will be really really

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:20,949
different from what it was two years and

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:23,459
five years and ten years in etc so what

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,870
is an open source policy really about

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,270
well it's essentially about two things

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:31,930
it's essentially about using open source

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,360
and by about contributing back to open

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,450
source right open source that comes into

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,870
the company open source that is produced

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,670
by the company let's have a quick look

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:47,230
at using opens

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:49,060
first so it turns out that we've been

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,160
using open-source for over two decades

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,860
at this point and so it's a well

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,590
understood problem which is essentially

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,900
about using software was licenses that

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,200
are compatible with your current

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:06,040
business model but also your future

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:10,570
business model right what might work now

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,640
as a SAS for example might not when you

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,490
want to do on promise in the future so

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,210
think about that and then the second key

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,380
aspect of using open-source of course is

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,770
making sure that you comply with the

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,550
licenses if you're chosen outside of

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,590
that there's not much to it really and

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,980
so I don't really want to spend more

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:36,220
time here because the really interesting

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,270
the really valuable part of a policy

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,490
from my perspective today as the part

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,690
that lets you engineer is contribute to

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,700
open source so let's dig into that a bit

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,860
and real quickly we notice that it's

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,640
actually way more complicated than we

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,530
initially thought as a start we have to

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,560
make a distinction between contributions

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,260
that are made at work as part of your

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,160
job and those that are made outside of

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,910
work what's that let's start with those

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,920
and you know here this is another

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,520
question that I often ask my audience

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,380
which is whether the contributions that

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,220
you make to open source in your free

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:25,720
time or actually yours to make can you

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,610
actually do that and you'll get a you

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,070
know a whole bunch of different answers

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,330
when you ask that question they usually

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,810
fall into those four different

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:39,850
categories which are yes I may but I'm I

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:41,800
must ask for permission yes I can and I

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:49,750
do not have to ask for permission

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:52,900
I don't know and no there was a study

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,150
that was done by github in 2017 which

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,130
asked a similar question

00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,650
two contributors of their open-source

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:03,280
projects and it turned out that a good

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,350
50% had really open and permissive

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,880
contribution policies and the world

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,490
basically allowed to contribute to open

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,150
source as they wanted to much more

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,950
concerning however was the fact that 37%

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:20,200
like more than a third of contributors

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,960
actually didn't know whether they were

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,160
allowed to contribute to no write and

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,260
think again that this is a super biased

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,910
sample it's actually folks really

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,280
already contributing to open source

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,850
projects on github was an open source

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,860
license right and even you know despite

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:44,559
down that bias well it turns out that

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,390
you know you know some folks really

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,330
weren't sure whether there were a lot to

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,550
do that or not and that begs the

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:55,210
question why is there so much confusion

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,790
about this right you know and it turns

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,860
out that it's this really depends on the

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,150
jurisdiction go in France it's going to

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,400
be different and then it is in

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,320
Switzerland it's going to be different

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,390
than it is in the US right and in the

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,780
USA it turns out that a lot of companies

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,570
own their employees production 24/7 this

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:17,290
is not the case in every state however

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:21,130
for example in California IP developed

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:25,059
outside of work belongs to employees

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,850
unless it's on company equipment and it

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:31,090
was pretty much every engineer in

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:35,020
Silicon Valley using a company issued

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:38,920
laptop you can imagine that this is

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,450
still very commonly a problem right and

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,360
of course like the consequence of that

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,160
that this makes it way more difficult

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,000
for employees to contribute to open

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,130
source so the common solution to that is

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,990
to get employees to ask for permission

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:58,210
and most complete I'm a process for this

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:01,120
the problem is that process will tend to

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,610
focus on releasing open source software

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,640
or working on a limited set of

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,420
pre-approved projects as soon as you

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
want to

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,080
tribute - OH - work with some bigger

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,590
projects like nodejs for example which

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,510
rely on so many small modules so many

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,830
separate dependencies this whole process

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,890
tends to break down really really

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,560
quickly so there's a better solution to

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:31,480
that which is called paper for balanced

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,880
employee IP agreement there's the whole

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,130
textile on on github it's a project that

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:42,130
was created by github actually based on

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:46,600
its own IP agreement um and it it has

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,570
really restricted ways in which IP

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,150
created by engineers belong to the

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,580
company basically unless you were

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,520
purposefully building something for the

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,400
company or that well that relates to the

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,320
company's business then the project is

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,120
yours and that makes it really easy for

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,370
you to contribute to open source on your

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,680
own time

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:16,030
alright let's dig into contributing at

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:20,200
work now right away we see here more

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,030
complexity because contributing at work

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,790
can be split up into two different

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,250
points one which focuses on releasing

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,680
new open source software and the other

00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,160
one which is commonly referred to as

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,860
patching ie contributing up streaming

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,890
bug fixes let's look at releasing

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,170
software first what you want to do here

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,540
is first of all you want to distinguish

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:47,080
large open source projects that you want

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,960
to promote and organize and get approval

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,850
around from smaller day-to-day modules

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,610
like one of the rules for example that

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:58,240
Google uses for this is to say you don't

00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:00,280
really need to get a legal approval if

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,110
you're really seeing something that has

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,840
less than 100 lines of code for larger

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,750
projects what you want to offer are

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,520
well-oiled and well documented processes

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,280
checklists templates tool links etc

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,700
right you'll find a ton of really good

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,429
advice on the to do groups github

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,809
count in the policies represent or

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:25,950
there's great stuff there use it

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,580
thirdly what you want to do is actually

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,529
offer help to engineers doing the work

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,559
guide them around your process make sure

00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:39,169
it's easy for them learn from the

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:42,769
friction points and improve it and

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:47,460
lastly one of the things that you can do

00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:51,600
instead is to promote working in the

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,960
open from the get-go right it is way way

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,480
way easier to open-source a project than

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,700
as an empty repository then to open

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,159
source a project that has had thousands

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:06,480
of commits from you know hundreds of

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:09,539
different engineers internally so that's

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,610
something that you want to consider and

00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:14,880
also it is way easier to build a

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:18,090
community around it alright so we looked

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,929
at releasing let's look at patching now

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:25,019
so this is by far the most common

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,809
activity that an engineer in 2020 and

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:31,289
Beyond will do and it is the most

00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:33,659
important one that is what makes them

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,000
part of the broader open-source

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,490
community this experience must be as

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
frictionless in as easy as possible

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,740
right so what do you want to do you want

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,639
to surface the process by which

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,760
decisions are made right and trust

00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:53,370
engineers to do the right thing again

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,500
make it easy for them to know what

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,720
they're allowed to do and trust that

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,570
they will do the right thing this lets

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,419
folk legal focus on the difficult cases

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:07,169
as I mentioned before right and of

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:09,630
course once you make decisions you want

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,750
to cache those you can even catch them

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,399
up front right but you want to make it

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,220
you know you want to build a proven the

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,529
nine lists so that you know every time

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,250
someone comes up with more questions

00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:25,049
you know wants to work a new project

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,669
you've you know what to answer them more

00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:31,100
quickly because you've done them you've

00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:35,130
done that already and you've done

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,870
so today we'll look at what an

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,110
open-source contribution policy looks

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:43,860
like right it split up into using open

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:47,210
source a1 on the subproblem and actually

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:51,660
contributing to open source which itself

00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:55,440
has outside of war contributions and

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,450
contributions on the job which again can

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,400
be spread up between releasing and

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:05,270
patching so that's it well not really it

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,710
turns out that you can actually create

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,220
applications or services out of your

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:15,390
policies right and make everyone's life

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,000
way easier in the process so that allows

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,680
you to an automatically approve request

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,160
that meets pre-established guidelines

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,410
right so for example let's say that you

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,020
want to approve your engineers to work

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,420
on anything that has an MIT licensed and

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,160
that isn't github right so you could

00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,050
just have that as a policy in your

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,600
service you don't even have to be a

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,880
legal team look at it anymore right that

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,730
also allows you to automatically reject

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,260
requests that don't meet your criteria

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:46,140
and if you do that you want to make sure

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,050
that you have a way to allow motivated

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,790
appeals so that your team can go to your

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,200
legal appointment and say well listen I

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:56,970
know that you have a policy against GPL

00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,270
for example but in that particular case

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,210
it makes sense here's why and then you

00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:07,230
want to manually handle all of the other

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:10,890
requests that don't meet them block or

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,410
allow lists and you want to cache those

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,710
decisions so you can get more automation

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,390
over time

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,460
Adobe did that a couple of years ago

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,000
right you know that allowed them to

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:28,920
shorten their review time from basically

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,880
a week to half a day for all new

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,640
requests that were not cached right and

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,400
you know after a few weeks I think over

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,670
95% of requests were cached and the

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,860
answer was immediate

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,400
and what's really really interesting

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:50,730
about turning your policy into an app or

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,490
service is that you're getting you start

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,620
to collect data about what your

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,620
developers and engineers are working on

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,870
right and this helps you understand your

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,420
open source activity better it helps you

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,640
promote it it helps you connect

00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,590
engineers that are contributing to

00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,930
similar projects but that don't know

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,580
that that's what they're doing right so

00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,920
there are tons of benefits to this

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,990
please feel free to reach out if you

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,480
want help selling something like that up

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,710
or discussing that I think it's a

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,070
fascinating topic and I'd love to help

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,270
folks get better systems here that

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,370
simplify and their engineers life

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,050
simplify they're legal teams life and

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:35,970
make everyone happier and make it easier

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,480
for their companies to contribute to

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:43,230
open source all right yeah the was that

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm done was my talk here if you have

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:50,430
questions please feel free to email me

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,410
at Toby at unlock open comm I'm happy to

00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:55,910
help you up thank you so much for your

00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,910
