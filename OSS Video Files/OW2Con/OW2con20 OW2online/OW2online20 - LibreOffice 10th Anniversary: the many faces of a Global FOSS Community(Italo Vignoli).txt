Title: OW2online20 - LibreOffice 10th Anniversary: the many faces of a Global FOSS Community(Italo Vignoli)
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	LibreOffice was announced in 2010 and will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2020. During these 10 years, the global community has grown from a small group of volunteers - mostly based in Europe - to a large and diverse group of free software advocates active in most countries. The presentation will discuss the challenges faced by the community during its incredible growth over the past 10 years.

00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,310
hello this is it 11 early from the

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,560
docking foundation today I'm going to

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,990
talk you about the 10th anniversary of

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,349
Libre Office and the story of the global

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,990
force community on July 19 2007

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,989
announced openoffice.org 10 years after

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,840
September 28 2010 the open office or

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,950
community announced Libre Office at the

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,100
time open office org was acquired by

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,469
Oracle within the acquisition of Sun

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,410
Microsystems and it was clear since day

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,050
one that it was not a strategic product

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,989
from Oracle's so the community decided

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,379
that it was time to create its own

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,120
project and its own foundation so we

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,489
announced the document foundation

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,990
because we wanted to drive the product

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,310
ourselves as community members we wanted

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,450
enterprises within the community but we

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,180
wanted a community to be on the driving

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,450
seat we chose the brand Libre Office

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,060
because Oracle and IBM at the time

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,630
refused to give the community the

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,860
openoffice.org brand we relaunch the

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:35,310
innovation exactly what is portrayed in

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:38,340
this graphic open office was under the

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,030
risk of abandon we relaunch the software

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:46,590
we decided to innovate it and improve it

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,630
over the years this is a researcher from

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,399
a Swedish University and it shows on the

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,759
Left what happened

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,250
10 months before the the fork and on the

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,840
right a 10 month after the fork in term

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,500
of contribution as you can see the fork

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,380
was originating diversity in the

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,250
community that was not there before as

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,830
son was really in control of the entire

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,040
project not only in terms of the

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,340
but also in term of managing the

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,890
community so we decided that our

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,540
founding principles were the copyleft

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,520
license no contributor agreement

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,340
meritocracy community governance and

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,430
vendor independence after 10 years we

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,650
can say that these were a very good

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,230
choice because they have allowed

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,090
LibreOffice to grow the document

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,190
foundation to grow this is the first

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:51,060
website of the document foundation it's

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:57,150
a little bit old according to current

00:02:51,060 --> 00:03:01,080
visual habits but it still valid in term

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:04,140
of contents we wanted a self-governing

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:09,300
meritocratic entity created by the

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,940
community and of course without the

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,680
developers we couldn't have libre

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,550
offices so let's see what the developers

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,700
have done over the years first of all

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,910
they've created the concept of the easy

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,060
acts the libreoffice code is 7 million

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,090
lines of code so it's not easy to deal

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,790
with especially for a newcomer so

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:38,390
developers have fractioned the

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:41,760
challenges in small hacks that were

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,670
accessible even to young developers and

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,840
this is allowed as you can see from this

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:52,620
chart a fast grow of the number of

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,350
developers each month we were able to

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,290
attract new developers of course in

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,300
October 2010 as you can see we attracted

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,140
a very large number of people that were

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,989
excited by the announcement but then we

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,610
were able to attract them over the years

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,769
every month for 10 years and this is an

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,580
extraordinary achievement if you think

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,940
that in the past the code of OpenOffice

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:25,590
was thought to be very difficult to deal

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,540
with developers have created unit tests

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,060
to improve the quad

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,460
of the product as you can see there has

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,090
been a growth in unit tests and answers

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,610
over time they have and not only

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,430
developers but also volunteers have

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,010
translated German comments in the source

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,460
code to English to make the source code

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:52,230
more accessible to one in a global

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,960
community of developers so in general in

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,780
ten years the we have achieved their

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,680
reduced footprint of the software we

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,010
have renovated the code remove the

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,860
useless lines of dead code

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:13,170
deprecated libraries translated German

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:17,400
comments to English and also used a

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,290
better C++ construct which are more

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,970
modern than in in the past

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:27,260
in general we have paid a substantial

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:30,750
technical depth that was there in 2010

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:35,310
in term of organization over the last

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:39,450
two years this is the split of commits

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:43,800
on gates as you can see there there are

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:46,940
a couple of companies contributing a

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,930
significant amount of code but also a

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,890
significant amount of code is

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:56,900
contributed by volunteers and this makes

00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:02,070
the project healthy because we don't

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:08,610
rely as in the past for over 60% to a

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:11,910
single company we use automatic security

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:18,360
and quality tools when possible

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:24,960
so this is the scanner of Coverity when

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:30,030
we achieve the record zero defect we we

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:35,250
still are at a 0.00 defect density which

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:39,480
is extremely important because you you

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:46,650
have a solid source code to build on

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:51,060
we also use fuzzing tools this is Google

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:54,000
or Esparza but we use others as you can

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,570
see from this chart over the years we

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,530
have used different fuzzing tools to

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:04,350
discover vulnerabilities to discover

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:08,310
weaknesses in the code and of course

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:12,180
without the community developers would

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:17,190
not be able to bring the software to the

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,160
global community of users so this chart

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,910
is from the dashboard the libreoffice

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,930
dashboard and shows the number of

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:31,350
questions and comments on ask

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:33,050
libreoffice there is a over the last two

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,390
years over the last couple of years

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,150
there is a continuous flow of questions

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:45,080
and a continuous flow of answers this is

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:47,790
all been managed by volunteers and this

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:53,540
always from the dashboard gives you an

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:59,240
overview of the community activity the

00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:02,550
the bar on the right is about the core

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,280
committers then you have the regular

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:09,440
ones and then you have the casual ones

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,330
as you can see the there is a stable

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,290
number of contributors over the months

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:20,070
of course there are fluctuations due to

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:24,800
the seasonality in some cases in terms

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:31,020
of numbers the the core contributors are

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:36,270
producing around 80% of the code and the

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:42,990
regular one around 15% and the casual

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:48,000
one about the remaining 6% so the in

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:51,810
general the community is Lt we are able

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,130
to produce a software which is backed by

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,580
a community

00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:01,320
and the community is really global this

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:04,170
is a map of where in dark green you can

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,180
see the community member that countries

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,430
work on there are community members and

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,570
unlikely in the countries where there is

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:16,650
a community active on libreoffice but

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,920
not specific community members we we

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:24,510
have now some additional countries where

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:28,370
there are members but the the situation

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:32,910
is evolving and the number of members is

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:37,020
increasing localization teams are

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:41,910
growing we use web light we move from

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:46,160
poodle recently we have 145 active

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:53,490
languages and around 120 are shipped

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,780
there are over 4 4500 users and over 400

00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,350
thousand translations

00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:03,210
this makes Libre Office as probably the

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,170
software available in the is number of

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:12,090
languages and it's important because

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:14,760
this also is protecting some native

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,760
languages that are under risk of

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,040
extensions in these cases we try to

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,720
provide a localized version of

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:28,890
LibreOffice in terms of users these are

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,940
estimates based on the global number of

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:37,800
PC users which are - between 2 and 3

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:42,540
billions 90% Windows 8 % Mac OS and 2 %

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,990
Linux we have 100% of Desktop Linux

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,540
users 10 percent of desktop Windows

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:53,790
users and 10 percent of desktop Mac OS

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:58,940
users in general this makes these

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:03,000
accounts for over 250 million users now

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:07,560
but we consider 200 million to be

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,680
conservative in terms of of numbers

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:17,460
the the increase that with the recent

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,760
situation of the virus spreading around

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,280
the world we have seen an increase of

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,340
downloads is probably the number of

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:31,290
users has increased because many users

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:33,870
that were not using an office suite at

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,840
home have probably decided to download

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:41,010
LibreOffice for their personal and in

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:45,870
some cases for their work activity these

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:50,750
are donations the project is backed by

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:55,860
donations we have a number of over

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:59,490
60,000 dollars per year and we are close

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:03,330
to 1 with 1 million euro in terms of

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,780
amount donations also have slightly

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:12,480
increased with the current unfortunate

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:15,660
situation LibreOffice is the product is

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,820
available in two versions LibreOffice

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:26,340
fresh which is the latest version we

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:30,030
suggest it to power users to people that

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:35,270
are willing to test and use the latest

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:39,720
feature of course might be in some cases

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:42,690
slightly less stable than the brofist

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,720
still which is the previous version is

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:49,850
also available in a long-term supported

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:53,030
version we suggest it to enterprises and

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,980
it's bathed by professional support

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:59,970
provided by certified individual

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,580
