Title: OW2online20 - Redefine Corporate CyberSecurity Frameworks under "COVID-19" Situations(Jesus Escolar)
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	Elevator Pitch: This talk is about the redefining the existing frameworks on CyberSecurity used in corporate environments to explain and prove the needed changes to apply in order to comply to with unexpected situations, as national confinement. Description: How does look like the existing corporate cybersecurity ecosystem from user to endpoint to perimeter to cloud to SaaS ? What was the existing security situation in terms of capacity, resources and scaling? What were the blind spots we missed in our existing frameworks? What security flaws happened (so far) in the corporate ecosystem? Now, How can we mitigate them going forward? But, How can we mitigate for the future unexpected situations? The Solution: An Unified CyberSecurity End-to-End Framework Lessons learnt (as per today's feedback).

[Music]

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:17,800
hello and thank you very much for

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,360
watching this recording about how to

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,669
redefine corporate cybersecurity

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,669
frameworks on situations like kovat 19

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:34,379
I'm Cassidy scholar and I will conduct

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:41,110
you through this little journey about

00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:45,460
the redefinition of those frameworks so

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:48,100
we accelerate our an organization that

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,559
it's been active in the open-source

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,610
ecosystem since a long time providing

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,070
and promoting plenty of integrations and

00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,570
solutions we operate in the

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,519
cybersecurity and seven intelligence

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:07,600
across amia and our goal is actually to

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:11,470
participate evangelizing and promoting

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,890
our knowledge across the ecosystem the

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:20,080
whole basis is educate help build and

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:24,480
repeat again I'm the CEO of accelerates

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,470
and I have a large experience on the

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,460
different fields related with

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,440
cybersecurity and sever intelligence and

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,510
one of the goals is that this

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,140
presentation tells you about all of

00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:41,320
these frameworks that we worked during

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:45,130
the last years and how when this

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,460
situation happened across the world we

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,940
were not ready to respond properly and

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,630
this is what we're gonna see now what

00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,610
are the moment cybersecurity frameworks

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,150
well when we talk about security you

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,530
talk about all the different solutions

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,690
that you need to put in place and all

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:09,310
the different elements and objects and

00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:15,069
procedures that you have to construct in

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:17,019
order to be secure for us it's a process

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,680
of harmonization we have to level the

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,810
same level of understanding between the

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,569
different

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,670
groups and business units in the company

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:33,590
not in an organization in order to be

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:36,860
able to provide a full view on the

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,650
overall security frameworks build those

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,550
best practices that the organization's

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:48,380
use to have a vision and strategy over

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:52,010
the years to come and establishing a

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,280
well known cybersecurity plans its

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,450
guidance its achieving compliance it's

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,000
getting to the level where organizations

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:07,570
want to be in terms of maturity in

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,680
security the purpose they serve is to

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:15,320
actually integrate all the risks that

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,630
are inherent in an organization which

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,640
are related to the people the processes

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,660
and the technology used which all

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,769
combine together

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,700
they define a business this business is

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,880
a risk all the time

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,739
and the people that are at risk and the

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,150
information of the company is always at

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,250
risk given the information of the

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,250
consumers of the users of the customers

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:42,640
so it's very important that we have an

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:47,690
actual element to establish a baseline

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,980
across all the different security

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,290
methods that we use in the different

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,750
areas to put them all together and to

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:58,280
harmonize that for the US this is going

00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,310
to be a cybersecurity framework and it's

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,250
going to be there to maintain a

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,829
relationship between compliance security

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,900
incidents and resolutions which

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,900
basically it's what we want we want you

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,700
to be compliant not having any security

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,340
issues of any type and when we had them

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,620
we have to be able to respond and then

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:23,840
to resolve them and make sure that we

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,789
don't have them again and again how many

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,220
cyber security framework exists there

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,990
are too many but if we if we Center

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,690
ourselves into the most important ones

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,310
we can look for example at the National

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,060
Institute of Standards and Technology

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,000
NIST

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,310
we can look for example at pci-dss as

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,220
one of the cybersecurity frameworks for

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,400
payment card payments we can look at the

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,610
ESO models 27001 of 0:02

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:58,450
we can look for example at C's which is

00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:00,830
mainly um broadly used across different

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,690
organisations and especially those who

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:08,120
actually are tied a lot with for example

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,760
cloud of containers we have a plenty of

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,790
open source solutions behind that the

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,650
helps will help us achieve C's

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,320
compliance and make sure that we are

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,840
aligned or per example we can look into

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,320
the beautiful CS a cloud control matrix

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,650
ECM which is very interesting when it

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,770
comes to cloud solutions cloud providers

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:35,710
to be actually compliant certified so

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:39,169
the goal is that we have to look into

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,570
into the frameworks and understand that

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,780
they are actually related to process

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,550
where we see a poster with the scribe

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,530
who's gonna be the target for the

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,580
security posture that we take in we

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,500
improve the posture we assess it the

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,229
progress and see how good are we at

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,310
deploying a framework and then we make

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:04,729
sure that we will communicate internally

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:08,960
against the findings and the resolutions

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,580
of that particular assessment with the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,490
security posture that we wanted to apply

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,880
and then we go as I said with keep on

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:22,639
looping the same process again and again

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,620
and again the problem is that those

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,450
frameworks are very good when we are in

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,970
an ideal world and in an ideal world

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,620
everything happens that we wake up in

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,010
the morning at 9:00 we go to work

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,260
everybody goes back at home at 5:00 like

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,440
in an ideal world we are not in an ideal

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,380
world so we see at the moment plenty of

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:46,430
changes in in the way that the world

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,000
tends to evolve especially when it comes

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,890
to technology and then when it come

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,660
so technology means cybersecurity how do

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,410
we apply this every security elements

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,270
into or our organizations and the

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,330
situation like a pandemic for example

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,350
which was totally unexpected it was an

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:07,160
example that we were at risk of

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,140
disrupting all our activities and all or

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,720
[Music]

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,820
potential standardized processes with

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,750
several separate acts that we were not

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:22,490
expecting with changes in technologies

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:26,760
with accelerations in decisions

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,880
everything came to to be accelerated and

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,710
force it at at the moment that the

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,310
pandemic exploded and nobody was ready

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,870
for that and the world worst thing about

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,630
it is that when you make the wrong

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,180
decisions you actually impact cyber

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,400
security because you're not taking in

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,810
consideration what are going to be the

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,770
consequences of those decisions

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:55,169
especially in IT a lot of companies we

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,580
saw it in first hand they accelerated

00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,500
all the processes that you call the

00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,790
frameworks and they said ok well these

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,890
are the frameworks that were using at

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,070
the moment and it happens that we need

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,760
to put 3,000 people for example in in

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:13,970
remote in in remote office given them

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:16,200
Hardware non-classified non-certified

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,090
non-validated with solutions that were

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,250
not in place in the beginning the word

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,169
deployed usually would take one or two

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,880
years to do a proper deployment and fit

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,030
into the into the proper cybersecurity

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,620
frameworks and have everything all the

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,330
boxes tick the ticked and having

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,370
appropriate a lot of companies just went

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,180
crazy and they decided just to deploy

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,979
everything because the business must go

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,849
on and this is something very important

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,680
if we follow the musical group queen

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,000
they say the show must go on and this is

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,040
the first amendment that happens to be

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,690
present on the companies you need to

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,240
keep on business when the business goes

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,480
first and that implies that a lot of

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,270
elements like for example on controller

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,260
devices rock devices Rock accesses were

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,030
given

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,700
a lot of fun control harder was

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:09,000
distributed permissions were assigned

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,670
without control and data was open to

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,070
people without even considering and all

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,630
of that was totally against all of those

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,310
framework but nobody could do anything

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,550
because we had that particular problem

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,440
how we were going to change the paradigm

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,540
but here we go

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,210
the way to change it is and this is what

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,530
we need to redefine in the several

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,320
security frameworks for this type of

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,690
situations is that we can do it the hard

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,400
way which is ask all of this

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,570
organization to rewrite the frameworks

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,930
can restrict of them and actually

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:45,690
rewrite them for all possible situations

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,100
like an exercise which is going to be

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,300
very difficult and it's going to be

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,640
nearly impossible to achieve they will

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,830
have to revise to revisit their models

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,480
and actually reassess themselves and

00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,600
think that probably the Newtonian right

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,760
if they're not doing it properly that

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,970
also means that potentially the model is

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,120
not working and they have to accept it

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,130
and it will be have it they will have to

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,020
rebuild the model again and again for

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,330
every different situation which is a

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,010
very difficult case rewriting or

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,930
rebuilding a cybersecurity framework

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,280
it's going to be very complex when it

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:26,900
comes from the organization who are

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,900
twenty manages it but

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,010
going to be the conclusions and

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,500
takeaways that we're gonna have out of

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:53,670
the redefinition referral either

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:55,930
redefining the the actual the actual

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,270
cybersecurity framework is that those

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,570
models are not canon and what they are

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,010
standards so they are not actually

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:09,640
expected to be the religion behind it so

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:14,140
they work when everything works so it's

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,630
not it's not it's not low you know it's

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,220
not it's not a definition of if when we

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,470
put it in place this is the way it has

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,350
to be when everything falls into place

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,550
they actually operate properly they are

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,040
there to be challenged we need to

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,120
challenge them all the time if we don't

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,980
challenges if we don't challenge them

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,410
there will be additional risks like for

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,020
example happen with the pandemic that we

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:42,100
had that change completely or way to

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,790
operate or cyber security operations way

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,340
to use it basically way to implement it

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,870
when something is unexpected we have to

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,990
think again we have to bring it back

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,700
again into the table and think okay we

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,450
have a situation that we don't know what

00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:02,260
to do with how are we going to actually

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:04,180
rebuild or or models to fit the

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,560
situation not the opposite how we're

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,440
gonna take the situation make it fit

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,750
into a model every time we would write

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,210
something for good it's gonna be the

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,920
best for all of us so we're gonna get

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,660
new models we're gonna very evolving

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,750
models we're gonna have something that

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,310
is built for the benefit of all of us

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,990
based on these situations and we need to

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,460
create new paradigms which means like

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,750
when we have a situation like coverage

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,510
we need to think about this somebody

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,400
thought about this actual pandemic

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,560
situation within their documents and I

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,390
thought what happens when I have to open

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,930
completely only accesses to the people

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,690
in the space of 24 hours 48 hours what

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,060
what are the steps to follow none of

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,550
that was considered before and it has to

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,820
be actually added by creating new ways

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,820
of thinking

00:12:52,509 --> 00:13:00,079
so how do we solve complex problems if

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,600
we don't have complex solutions and this

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,790
is one of the big problematic situations

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:10,269
that we have with the existing

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,970
cybersecurity framework is that they are

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:17,269
very complex and the situations that we

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,470
have are also very complex and it's very

00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:20,420
difficult to put them in place when

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,819
there are situations where as I said

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,410
before everything has to fall in place

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:27,500
in order to for everything to work

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,180
properly and in order to use properly

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,959
the framework who needs to challenge the

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,550
existing instead to school so how do we

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,529
do that

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:40,579
why don't we use a new paradigm while we

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:42,819
don't create what we have called here a

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:46,759
continuous cybersecurity framework

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:49,009
improvement which basically is taking

00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:53,480
the existing frameworks putting them

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:56,839
into place but also challenging them to

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,209
be rebuild and make them adaptive by

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,350
using serious games and a serious game

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:06,470
for example is what the department of

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,470
homeland security in the u.s. does when

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,019
they challenge a situation about rioting

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:16,220
or a terrorist attack in a certain city

00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:18,680
or pandemic situation and for example

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,759
you can actually challenge your company

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,470
with serious games establishing what

00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,589
happens if tomorrow we have a massive

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:32,149
pandemic or we have a power outage or we

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:34,550
have a terrorist attack or we have a

00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:39,670
situation where the whole businesses in

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:43,130
the whole region even with worldwide

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,899
impact gets affected and how can we

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,970
actually what decisions are going to be

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,279
made and what are going to be actually

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,410
the impact of those business decisions

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,220
into cybersecurity have them in advance

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:59,050
and actually as we say below build a

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:02,149
continuous learning model into your

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,339
framework to actually rebuild it and

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,889
rebuild it and rebuild it and adapt it

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,519
to situations that you were

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:13,299
not expecting in order to to actually

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,100
have a proper cybersecurity framework it

00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,259
needs to be challenged and it needs to

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,129
be revealed and it needs to be revealed

00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:23,049
based on elements that are not the

00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,929
existing elements that we used today

00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:28,809
neither the metrics or the controls that

00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:36,009
we have but new approaches and a new way

00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:37,959
of thinking thank you very much

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,629
all hope that you enjoyed the

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,079
presentation and if there are any

00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:50,100
questions I will be very happy to take

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,100
