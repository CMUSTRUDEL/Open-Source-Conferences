ngi pointer also has a work program that

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
suggests nine

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,760
areas for your bottom-up project

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,519
these range from privacy by design to

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,599
network optimization

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,959
autonomous network operations energy

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,080
efficiency and so on and so forth

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,159
but these are just for guidance you are

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
welcome to develop projects in related

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
areas that will contribute to the

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,879
renovation

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,879
of the internet

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,840
now as i mentioned i am from funding box

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
and we are the partner responsible for

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,799
the

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,159
open calls we have our open call

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
management system

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,440
which i will explain to you in a bit and

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
i will also take you through the

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
application process which is very

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
intuitive

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,680
and easy to use to get started with this

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
process

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
all you need to do is create a funding

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,319
box account

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
so that you can access the platform

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,959
where the application form is hosted

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
and then you will need to click apply

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,640
now

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
followed by start an application

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
so as you can see there are a list of

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
compulsory sections which you will need

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
to complete

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
we ask for basic information about you

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,360
and your team

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,480
information related to your project and

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,159
other relevant information as well

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
it is all online and you can even come

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
back in your own time to complete the

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,799
application

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,959
at a later point and importantly there

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,519
is no need to process any paperwork

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,519
until you are selected for funding

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
on top of that you can export the

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
application as a pdf

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,639
and in the scenario that you create more

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
than one application

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
for instance if you want to create a

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,520
test application you are able to delete

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
the application

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,680
that you do not plan to submit by

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,560
clicking delete this application

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
remember that only one application

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,040
can be submitted per team and it's the

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
first application that is submitted

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
that will be evaluated

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
so to summarize it's a very

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
straightforward process

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
you first need to sign up and then you

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
click

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
apply followed by start a new

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
application

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,600
you then have to fill out all the fields

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,600
and then click submit

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,120
the proposal itself should take you only

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
about a day to a day and a half to

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
complete

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,199
so we've really tried to streamline the

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
process as much as possible for you

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,240
so just some very helpful things to

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
remember

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
as i mentioned only the first submitted

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
proposal will be evaluated so make sure

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
you submit the correct proposal and

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,840
delete any unwanted proposals

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
you can also edit after you submit the

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,320
proposal

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
you can add a contributor to help you

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,199
fill out the application

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,759
so this could be a member of your team

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
you can only submit once you have filled

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,600
out all the compulsory fields so if you

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
don't fill out all the compulsory fields

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
the button the submit button will be

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
greyed out

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
and finally remember to submit before

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
the deadline because anything that comes

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,600
after the deadline

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,600
is not considered eligible

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
