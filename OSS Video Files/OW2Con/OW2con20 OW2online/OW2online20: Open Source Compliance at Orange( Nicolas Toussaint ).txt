00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,690
hello everybody welcome in this session

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,630
I'd like to talk about open source

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,210
compliance and how it happens here at

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,580
orange group as a whole so I'll be

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,529
talking about the processes we have and

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,750
the tools we use here at orange gay but

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,870
first why is sharing what's the point of

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,210
sharing that you know open source

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,719
compliance is a fairly new and complex

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,710
topic I companies are can you organize

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,370
to address the problems and how do you

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,800
tackle new problems best probably by

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,199
internal trial and errors but also by

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,379
observing and sharing out the company's

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,600
trial and errors I found myself that's

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,109
reading through the group's use cases

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,899
for example and listening to other

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,840
companies stories was a very valuable

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,430
and instructive way to improve the way

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:16,290
do it internally so I thought sharing

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,460
this might be valuable to others okay

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,860
the menu is quite simple some processes

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,860
some touring and the quick conclusion

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,909
ok so first the processes so across a

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
group we have quite a few entities the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,040
carrying very different activities so

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,210
just a few examples which the first

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,530
would be the case of the model company

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,350
doing mostly internal projects and

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,780
business to customer services so they

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,259
will do mostly open source publications

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,310
of the

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,810
internal project model entities will do

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,360
more software developments for

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,180
businesses and these kind of entities

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,829
will do software distributions all the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,049
time some others will be specialized in

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,569
cloud hosting services and of course

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,319
you'll expect them to run open source

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:15,590
software software as a service

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,730
last example would be on the entities

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:23,120
doing integration services so these

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,980
entities they will be deploying open

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,780
source software and customers premises

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,940
and in all cases that they might be

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,610
confronted to contribution to existing

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:42,620
open source projects of all sizes from

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:45,470
tiny ones to do a huge project so we

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,099
have three situations here the first is

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,900
the publication classic you have a new

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:54,349
project that's your own and we won't

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,660
release it and open source license it's

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,769
also a contribution of a certain size to

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,970
existing open source project second will

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:06,319
be distribution which happens when you

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,319
distribute your projects to your

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,799
customer either the binary or the source

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,019
code or both and considering that

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,620
customers mates in turn distribute the

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,680
project to their own customers and the

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,190
rest want to be the patches which is a

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,470
simpler form of publication managers

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:32,120
what is just a you know typo or quick

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:34,850
fix but of course a lot of projects are

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,030
just a mix of these situations for

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,030
example you have products and you want

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,459
to adapt it for a customer and

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,280
specifically and then you it's

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,359
distributed by another entity and at the

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,470
same time you want to offer the service

00:03:49,359 --> 00:04:01,069
software as a service so that leads to

00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:04,280
sometimes complex situations so how do

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,780
we get organized to tackle open source

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,669
usage validation we have a network of

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,750
open source referent across the group

00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:19,130
that are missions to follow the analysis

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:22,610
from the start to the end we of course

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,070
have a team of lawyers and intellectual

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,180
property people specialize in open

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,030
source

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,690
and we also have a team dedicated to

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:39,720
conducting scans of the source codes for

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,760
the project FTD okay so what's the

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,850
process the starting point is the

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,830
project requesting another's rights this

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,910
request is assigned to an open source

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,190
reference and then we have to analyze

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,120
the use case of the project so we need

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,180
to know if its front ends back ends and

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,770
buried mobile standalone software

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,660
because you know the license is not

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,940
apply the same way of course quite often

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:14,460
projects are mixed of these of these use

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:17,730
cases then the source code is scans and

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,510
we produce you know a factual report

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,060
that has to list all the source codes

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,270
that is available under an open source

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:32,960
license so there's no interpretation at

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:36,480
that point it's just a factual list this

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,160
reports is analyzed with the lawyer

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:44,550
people the project members and reference

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,310
so it's analyzed with respect to the

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,740
architecture of the projects the the way

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,230
it's distributed its how its to be

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,630
published and so on all the context of

00:05:52,230 --> 00:06:01,830
the project already in validation is

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:04,080
given or maybe not and together with a

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,860
sets of recommendations so the headers

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,230
that are missing the license text and

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,980
the bout window for example and so on

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:18,000
and so forth so this is the this is the

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:21,150
legal validation right after the legal

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,740
validation the reference make sure that

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,840
all recommendations are applied and when

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,930
everything is ready when the projects

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,169
assured that everything's been done the

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,759
reference can close the tickets

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:40,740
and that points project and publish our

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:45,960
distributes the source codes or the

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:48,779
binaries right so we need tooling to

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,389
conduct the analysis because we need to

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,360
analyze the source code that we won't

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,610
publish or distribute so what do we want

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,069
to know for each project we need to have

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,749
a list of the open source components

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,770
that are integrated in the source code

00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:06,599
as well as their dependencies ok for

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,879
each of these components we need the

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,759
name the version it's licensed

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,180
copyrights that apply a reference URL

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,749
and in some cases has the component been

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,710
modified by the project ok

00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:24,689
when it gets a bit more complex we also

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,509
need to know about the architecture of

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,879
the project if third parties companies

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,370
are involved for example what kind of

00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,289
contracts have been signed are there any

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,939
specific cities and so on for

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:42,210
publications we need to assure that CA

00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:47,939
or DC you have to be signed and make

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:51,149
sure it's done properly so to analyze

00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:54,180
the source code of the project without

00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:59,339
looking at the dependencies we use

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,270
extensively for Sorachi we have multiple

00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:05,339
instances across the group that are

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,370
built automatically mixing our own

00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:12,830
homegrown features with the community

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:17,399
version is automatically deployed and

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:19,649
running on docker so we develop our own

00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:25,759
features and push them as much as we can

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:25,759
to the community that works pretty well

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,880
so concerning the analysis of the

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:34,919
dependencies with not so goods

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,620
there are different tools and I can help

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,409
doing that and the usage depends on the

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,889
projects and the technologies I can

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,159
imagine

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:47,520
open source review toolkits that we can

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,870
use a little bit but nothing is

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,950
automated yet and/or industrialized but

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,780
that will come in the future - just a

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,150
few more words about the integration of

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,210
the tools to say that we worked for

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,460
Sarah G to get lab CI and Jenkins so we

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,400
can now track the scans automatically

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:12,240
when the products are built we're also

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,760
working on a new feature that would let

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,470
the products know that they pushed open

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,180
source files in source code their

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,710
projects so they can be alerted

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:26,280
according to the use cases I was talking

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,490
about before for example you know the

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,430
list of authorized licenses will be

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,700
different for the projects there are

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:42,270
more front-end software back in software

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,500
embedded software etc etc we also work

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,160
on KPIs

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,560
so we are sending up this new graph on

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,740
abased dashboards that collects metrics

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,980
produced directly by fast ology so here

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,510
we track the number of projects we

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:03,120
tracked the number of users of groups of

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:07,500
files scans the number of different

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:11,070
licenses etc this project is called fast

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,800
- and I guess since this is prerecorded

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:18,800
by the time the conference is happening

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:22,140
that will be available on github

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,010
ok ok time for conclusion so what can I

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,070
say you know it's it works hopefully we

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,560
can scan and audits the projects and

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,430
verify the the usage of a putos

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,400
so happy but there's a lot lots of room

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,380
for improvements of course what can I

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,070
say so far we have you know a strong

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,710
working process dedicated reference that

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:50,520
are able to handle the the analysis from

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:54,930
start to end we have integrated and

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,720
constantly improving truly also the

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,830
dedicated lawyers and IP specialists

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:06,660
that carry on the analysis

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:11,930
and we have dedicated team to scanning

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,930
using physiology and soon other tools

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,690
but of course we need to merge much more

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,550
we need to improve the analysis of

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,420
dependencies in the projects to make

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,880
this very much more automatic and we

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,390
need like most other companies you know

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,350
to improve an analysis of containers and

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:38,160
when when we deploy in when distributes

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:42,180
for example docker images that's a very
