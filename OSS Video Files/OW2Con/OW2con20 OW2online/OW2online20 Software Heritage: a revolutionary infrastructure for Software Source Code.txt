	Software Heritage: a revolutionary infrastructure for Software Source Code
( Roberto Di Cosmo )
Open Source Software is at the heart of our digital society and embodies a growing part of our technical and organisational knowledge, and this raises many questions: how to comply with the obligations of Open Source licenses? how to be sure that the source code of a key module we use will be still there when we need it in the future? do we really know what source code we are using, and where it comes from? how can we adress cybersecurity if we do not know? how do we share this information across the software supply chain? Answering these questions and answering them well is quite a challenge. In this presentation, you will discover Software Heritage, an open non-profit initiative, in partnership with Unesco, and supported by major IT players, and how the revolutionary infrastructure it is building changes the way we adress these issues. With 8 billions unique source files from 120 million repositories, it is the largest archive of source code ever built. You can already access and use this infrastructure. We now invite you to help it grow, and take part in its unique undertaking.
