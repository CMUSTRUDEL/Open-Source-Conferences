[Music]

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,210
good morning everyone

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,540
and a warm would come to the other blue

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,220
to online conference thank you for

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,210
attending this special edition I

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,550
sincerely hope you all well and safe as

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,510
many others I suppose I would have liked

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,609
shaking hands

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,000
sharing a coffee chit chatting between

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,309
talks but don't worry despite of this

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,410
condition we have cooked an exciting

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,510
program for this special edition of a

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,290
double took own thanks to all the

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,149
speakers and our wonderful staff the

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,450
choice of going online was a difficult

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,280
one not only because we had to face in a

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,010
really short time some new technical

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,739
challenges but because it was about

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,289
finding a fair balance these balance

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,170
many of us was for to find all served

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,109
during these crises this balance between

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,870
freedom of meeting each other the

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,630
security of our health of you health and

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,990
the responsibility we can endorse all we

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,990
want to delegate there is no of your

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,320
sensor I like to code these words from

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,170
Isabella you see a famous u.s. woman

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,330
freedom security and responsibility all

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,560
the three vertices of an impossible

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,650
triangle in our everyday life personal

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,920
or professional I believe we all face in

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,040
this choice hopefully with less critical

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,920
States most of time as a free software

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,710
advocate as a member of our W community

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,659
I yet believe this is our mission to

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,829
help software users finding this balance

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,869
of course every user wants to be free

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,750
for software vendor lock-in and is

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,939
concerned about privacy there is an

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,820
example of zone privacy concerns

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,390
demonstrated this concern go far beyond

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,270
this piece the geeks community that as

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,009
an IT department manager can I check the

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,960
responsibility of deploying a free

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,379
software based solution for my users

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,070
that depend on it for the everyday work

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,810
what security can I give to the

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,540
if the community drive and software safe

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,990
who should I speak to in case of failure

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,180
of back the free software give me the

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,160
possibility to edit the software on my

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,360
own and fix it that's fine

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,580
but can I take this responsibility for

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,070
certain years now it has been at the

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,830
bootys mission to be the trustful secure

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:41,210
sustainable free software ecosystem that

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:44,240
never compromise on freedom we host free

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,950
software projects not open core projects

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,920
not digest

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,400
free software there is no discussion

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,990
about this we have developed strong

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,240
quality assessment tools for this

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,280
project as the free software user and

00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,080
developer for 20 years now I am

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,090
convinced free software development

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,300
model intrinsically brings a better

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,930
quality but this is not enough we need

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,360
to demonstrate it so do we with projects

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,550
like whiskers cross miner we are now

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,040
able to provide users comprehensive

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,560
quality metrics which projects like

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,450
stamp we're providing the broker tools

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,840
to improve the quality of their code in

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,030
a really innovative way and now on top

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,310
of these tools we are about to build a

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,310
business case that gives up arrogance

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,180
the maturity level other project this is

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,250
the market readiness level finally there

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,680
are W industry members are not only

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,050
developing free software they are also

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,750
able to take the responsibility of the

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,680
integration the maintenance and the

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,450
support of comprehensive IT solutions

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,850
thanks to ongoing efforts from other

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,740
blue community and others thinking of

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,930
open source initiative free software

00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,270
foundation eclipse foundation and so

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,180
many others free software is now

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:06,290
recognized as a credible sustainable and

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,120
secure investment in particular we want

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,820
to greet the recent adoption by the

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,860
European Parliament of a resolution that

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,560
prioritize investment in free software

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,410
this definitely acknowledged the free

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,169
software ecosystem in general as a solid

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,300
industry that complete the ongoing

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,710
support from a European Commission to

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,750
pre software development

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,199
through research projects for many years

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,120
now in this context we also want to

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,310
welcome the Eclipse Foundation that

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,740
recently moved its headquarters to

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,599
Europe this year with collaboration in

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,729
mind we are looking forward to

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:44,090
strengthen position of free software in

00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:46,400
Europe that being said let's hit the

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,889
road for this uh w2 online conference I

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,319
will let select omnipresent in detest

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,289
these two days of wonderful keynotes and

00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:58,840
project presentations thank you and

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,840
welcome again to our w2 online

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:09,970
welcome to the boutique on 20 well first

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:14,500
of all I hope you're healthy and well

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:17,140
and safe and precisely because of the

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,730
pandemic this conference is a bit

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:26,260
special with the pandemic going on and

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:29,670
travel bans and look down we had to make

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,680
the decision to take a little to online

00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,200
so we waiting into the last minute but

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,880
eventually we decided to turn other

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,910
bruticon into virtual events but we also

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,630
decided to keep the dates so this

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:52,210
virtual conference is on june 17th and

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:55,870
18th and we've also decided to organize

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,240
a face-to-face event as a community we

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,660
need informal conversations we need to

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,180
meet so we have decided to still

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,290
organize after lockdown when all this is

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,140
over in November the 3rd we hope a

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:15,610
face-to-face event which we call the

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:18,870
route to Community Day so this year's

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,040
conference is twofold

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:28,180
the online event is autoroute online

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:32,620
it's series of presentations we kept our

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,860
usual 15-minute format and we decided to

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,120
play it safe with the combination of

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:43,620
recorded presentations and live chat

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:47,290
live interactivity with the speakers and

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,890
November there will be the face to face

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:55,240
event so it will be more festive the

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:58,800
ability to Community Day will have a

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,710
program of keynote addresses run tables

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,360
the ability of best projector world the

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,260
famous what we do free beer party and

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,400
we've set aside plenty of time for

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,550
informal conversations

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,260
so this is what we have this year or the

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,640
return line and orderly to Community Day

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,500
what you brew two online rows on

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,510
open-source software it was a

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,070
requirement for us of course and we're

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,830
very proud of the platform we put

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:39,750
together in barely one month we've

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,520
totally reengineered our technical

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:49,500
environments and this is open source

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:53,520
software at the best we've used some of

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,350
our projects we've benefited from the

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,940
support and responsiveness of our

00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,200
speakers so this is again through open

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,850
source software and community

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:10,950
collaboration in action the platform we

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:16,170
put together runs on other projects rock

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:21,680
chat and ex wiki we've used pre talks

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:25,680
for the program we've used OBS for the

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,780
video operations and for the streaming

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:34,170
we've decided to play it safe and go

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:37,560
through YouTube life all this has been

00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:41,100
possible thanks to the efforts of many

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,010
people so it's time for some thank yous

00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,710
of course first of all the ability to

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:50,910
management office fortunately we are all

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:53,220
home-based and the lockdown has not been

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,850
too disruptive for us and we've managed

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,000
to spend block downtime busy working on

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,510
real engineering or the VidCon and

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,330
preparing this new platform we've also

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,700
benefited from the support and the

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:12,060
standing of our speakers to which to

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,150
whom we have communicated the new

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,790
process so they all really adapted well

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,800
it hasn't been very easy for all of them

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,620
it's a difficult exercise and even some

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,610
of them did not make it so

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,430
congratulations to all the speakers on

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,200
the program and and of course our

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,820
sponsors

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,930
their support and trust mean a lot to us

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:39,810
so thank you orange software heritage

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:45,540
engineering funding box the Eclipse

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:47,160
Foundation blue mind and Microsoft your

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,170
trust and support are greatly

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:57,720
appreciated so now we have a nice

00:09:52,170 --> 00:10:01,160
program of some thirty presentations and

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,920
speakers representing thirteen

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,720
nationalities and this is packed in five

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,320
sessions so the first session is about

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,170
ecosystem so it's looking at open source

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,920
not so much as a way to collaboratively

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,440
develop software and open source license

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,990
licenses to software but really open

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,020
source as part of our economies the

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,720
second session is concentrates on the

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,840
ability code base with some highlights

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,110
on some of our projects the third

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,620
session is concentrates on we call it

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,990
open to state of the art and it looks at

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,900
open source as a way to design and

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,550
implement more efficient and desirable

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:52,610
solutions the fourth session is

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:57,180
concentrate on collaborative research

00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:01,140
projects that are enabled by open source

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,360
software and the last session the fifth

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:08,790
session which will take place on the

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,250
second day is about governance but not

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,590
so much about compliance but the tools

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,560
but compliance it's a big coverage of

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,480
all the resources about compliance and

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,240
managing the open source software within

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,700
an organization but it's also that what

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,600
we call implementing good open shows

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,210
governance now I still have some

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,920
housekeeping instructions or indications

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:38,040
left so first of all as I said

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,509
the presentations are recorded and they

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,519
are all programmed to start on time so

00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,199
the timing is indicated in the program

00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,209
so refer to the program to organize your

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:53,609
day within session we will launch a chat

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:56,309
channel with the speaker behind so you

00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:59,399
can directly interact with the speaker

00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:01,350
and of course the chat channels will

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,129
remain open throughout the rest of the

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,139
conference we will have coffee breaks

00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:09,829
lunch breaks and of course the chat

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:13,069
channels will be open throttle breaks

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:16,919
you notice on the side there are two

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:18,989
official channels one is for help where

00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:23,459
you can ask questions if you have any

00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:26,309
difficulty or any question to ask us and

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:29,279
the other channel is about is for

00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:33,179
general announcements so keep an eye on

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,239
these channels we the management offices

00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:39,569
behind and each of us has a role to play

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:43,429
and Beaman will be monitoring this the

00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:43,429
whole conference your online conference

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:54,179
so with that I'm excited to open the

00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:55,230
ritual of audibility online it's it's

00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,249
something we've never done before

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,559
it's still learning with the trial so we

00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:04,499
hope you will understand if things are

00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,449
not as smooth or seamless or you would

00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:10,499
expect them to be but we've done our

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:13,049
best and we hope you're going to enjoy

00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:17,929
the experience as much as we've enjoyed

00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:22,350
working on it so without further ado I'm

00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:26,089
happy to declare all of you online open

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,089
