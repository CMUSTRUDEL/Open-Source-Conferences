Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	Digital twins concept can be summarized as the association of a real entity with a digital replica, many applications will be covered some ethical questions remains and some solutions will be presented to make this technology desirable with a privacy by design approach. The "Web of Twins" experiment will be presented as an implementation using JavaScript and WebThings API from devices to VR/XR user interface.

[Music]

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,400
hi I'm Philip Koval and I will share

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,910
some experiments about the digital twin

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,250
today

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,430
so one Murray I'm a software engineer

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,779
from Branton II in France and the

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,900
currently working as an apprentice

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,910
contributor as a modular right from IOT

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,789
projects so I've been involved in the

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,800
past in open source software for the

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,050
industry and mostly on unbidden

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,010
development like Tizen operating system

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,649
Yocto for automotive and I utility or CF

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,469
when I was at Samsung so you can contact

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,750
me at this address Borg /rz

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,219
are and I'm an available for any

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,460
cooperation or opportunities so you can

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,930
also check some previous presentation on

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,160
related subject and video and social

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,850
media and so on

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,160
so what hard is it are twin this can be

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,830
defined by this very short definition

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,220
it's a digital replica of a physical

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,850
entity with a community VT between the

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,250
pair so once one it's changing the other

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,950
is updated at the same time once the

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,460
other one is been changing it can

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,380
reflect to reality so we have a kind of

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,670
seamless interaction between the device

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,350
or its model and we can use like a

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,780
shadow object if the object are

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,060
disconnected and we can also use this

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,470
shadow object as a proxy to the actual

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,920
thing to update some properties and of

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,700
course we can view this 3d object in a

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,630
simulation and you can realize this in a

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,490
VR environment or augmented reality so

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,119
it's not not something new because it

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,939
was introduced in year 2002 and actually

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,430
a couple of years earlier I cracked some

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,490
kind of puppet show on the internet

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,920
using sensor and VRML

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,300
plugins but today is now it's more

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,250
easier than it used to be in the past so

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,850
I will introduce who's we

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,220
this concept so I have this robots and I

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,550
can control each motors of it and it

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,890
will update the robot here so this is

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,290
the crew I'm changing somewhat the angle

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,590
of the motor for the hand and the Queen

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,060
open and the same time the 3d model is

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,340
updated at the same time so you can

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,520
create some kind of smart behavior

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:41,480
between the device like this using web

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,650
sing roller and rain I can update some

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,810
properties of the robot so when I'm

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,780
pressing this approaching button I can

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,590
move the shoulder to 45 degrees and the

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,050
harm to minus 45 and turn the light on

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,910
and at the same time I create another

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,390
route which is doing exactly the same

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,580
thing but in the opposite direction and

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,310
when I press on my website dashboard

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,380
button like this robot approaching

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,920
Boonton it turn on the light as we saw

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,989
when the robot is moving in reality and

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,580
in the simulation and I have this extra

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:21,150
sensor on the CRO on my robot and if I'm

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,280
changing the color of my light from

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,010
right to green and look back to the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:32,640
sensor it's a bit it has greenish so we

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:35,820
have this behaviour so I can have so

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,040
control from a VM environment or the

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,900
dashboard using 3d element like this

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,709
switch and I can toggle it on and off

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,140
just like I did before it will update

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,310
the actual robot and the 3d model which

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,310
is a simplified version

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:58,159
so how can you that win can be used so

00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,980
it's very wide because we have some kind

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,079
of device as a service concept so even

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,349
if the device itself is not yet created

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,900
you can design it and simulate it before

00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:13,099
you have it created and then you can

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,900
deploy to an actual place and if you

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,620
have some an issue you can record and

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,810
play back what has been done so that's

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,479
one use case and the other is remote

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,849
controlling that's what I've been doing

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,620
just before so this can be really apt

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:31,460
for in a lockdown situation when you can

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:35,060
get access to you machine and this is

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,770
useful for impact analysis and improve

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,110
decision-making and it's part of the

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,300
product flight management and so this

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,430
can be using many different domain from

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,560
the industry so we can imagine it's

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,599
applied as a production chain when you

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,220
have different robots working together

00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,400
and if you want to see if they're

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,199
getting along and they are not

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,220
conflicting themselves you can do a

00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,570
simulation first and try to see if then

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,270
something can be able to optimize

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,430
without stopping the production it can

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,699
be also been used in city when you want

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,830
to have real-time visualization about

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,340
the traffic in the city or the buildings

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,349
and you can use our so robotics eyes are

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,900
shown and the interaction with humans

00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:19,940
like robotics and it can be used in

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,080
different area I know there is some 5g

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,060
experiment using digital twins so there

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,419
is many use case and you can check what

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,930
the w3c is trying to describing at this

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,210
moment why we here I want to speaks

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,849
about some ethical consideration and I

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,400
want to remind that in Europe GDP I

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,039
regression is trying to promote system

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,380
to be ending privacy by design and by

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,840
default so that's an opportunity for

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,710
open-source software because privacy is

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,360
part of our community DNA so the

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,909
challenge we have today is can we create

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,729
some digital twins with privacy in mind

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,950
and to have something which is a user

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,620
data centric and easy tries to be more

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,419
resilient

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,009
so here I'm going to want to do the web

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,280
because I believe it's a platform for

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,629
creating this kind of scenario so the

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,509
web has been created for

00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:17,240
interoperability in mind it was built on

00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:19,879
open standard and free software also and

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,849
it's this front rise adjuster I see was

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,069
the internet at the beginning and the

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:28,719
browser itself is providing a trusted

00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:31,639
environment for iterating application of

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:34,669
course the web is programmable you can

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,099
use a REST API for interacting with web

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,319
services and if you need some real time

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,500
you can use a WebSocket technology also

00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,259
and for UI on UIC's we have a lot entry

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,800
into the world using HTML but also now

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:52,279
we are targeting the 3d world using

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,830
different API like WebGL to accept GPU

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,400
for virtual reality and augmented

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,889
reality is part of this extended reality

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,270
so I will show a couple of framework

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:08,270
I've been using and also let's mention

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,539
about IOT because there is a working

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,909
group at the w3c which is trying to

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:18,080
propose some standard for dealing with

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:21,110
actual things on using the web platform

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,919
and one open-source implementation is

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,430
Mozilla web things so it's a splat one

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:31,909
platform where user can control all the

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,439
device in its own and you I can control

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,689
them from the web using a you are

00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,719
dashboard and create some kind of

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:40,610
automation using rules that's what I'm

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,279
being shown just before and the platform

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,039
itself is extensible with add-ons so you

00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,039
can support new protocols or new

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,180
services or new some kind of new device

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,789
or radio protocol whatever you need

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,339
there is no limit to this and for the

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,189
record it has been inspired by the web

00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:04,849
browsing the walk and simplify the sings

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:07,729
description using JSON schemas so

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:10,610
privacy is one of the key very feature

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,919
of this website platform because all the

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,700
devices are connected together inside

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,310
the user alone so

00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,470
each of them is a server connected to

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,220
the Gateway which is giving access to

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,040
the user

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,260
and the data stay at the edge so there

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,210
is no cloud involved because dashboard

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:32,320
is running on the Gateway itself

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,570
and all of device resource can be also

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,169
shared to other application in a safely

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,960
way using JSON web token and the REST

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,700
API or WebSocket and if you need to get

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,280
access from the internet it's also

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,710
possible using a channel provided by

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:54,120
package guide so for the UI we saw the

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,830
2d dashboard which is actually SVG and

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,810
for creating 3d application it's also

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,030
possible in a virtual reality or

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,970
augmented reality and now we are talking

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:06,640
about extended reality so that's another

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,820
word for 3d rendering in a browser using

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,760
different framework and undoing some

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,710
device center so let's set for instance

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,590
you have some orientation stand so we

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,440
can you can update the view so

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,030
everything is hundred by so iframe

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,210
framework I've been using which is based

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:28,000
on 3GS and which is based on a WebGL API

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,720
and in the end it is running on the GPU

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,790
so you have a decent performance and the

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,270
thing graph is made of different model

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,370
that can be parametrized and for from

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,150
the document object model you can access

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,810
each element in the scene and you can

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,820
for instance target one object and

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:53,310
change the rotation using as a two gs

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:57,250
objects API and you can also describe

00:09:53,310 --> 00:10:01,090
your your device using a higher level

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,620
API using json schema so for instance we

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,610
are not talking about a rotation but

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,860
let's say we are modeling like a compass

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,890
which is just an angle which is a ND

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:16,660
indicating the direction of the north so

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:19,750
the next step now is to bind so what can

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,970
be measured in in the real world from

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,250
IOT so we have let's say a compa sensor

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,740
and you can bind this to an X

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,100
one month so I've been doing this for

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,060
using a web component and why I'm here I

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,530
can show you another demonstration using

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,000
Mozilla hub so hobbies

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,420
perhaps is a social platform where you

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,240
can connect together and make some shots

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:51,340
room in a 3d environment so it's running

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,140
on a browser or mobile and you can move

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,800
in this on your own month work just like

00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,190
if you were in a computer game and our

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,500
device our client are sharing the same

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,680
everyone mountains I updating is a same

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,690
time so imma be dating here my position

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,150
on the phone and it's updated in a 3d

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,340
world at the same time but it go beyond

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:19,390
that this so I created the is a 3d model

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:23,710
in a which is a replica of my this small

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:26,680
house prototype and when I'm moving it

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:30,490
in the real world it will be updated

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,940
also in the 3d environment so how does

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,970
this work so we have here a Raspberry Pi

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,660
with a couple of sensor so we have to

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,520
control at the on this corner of the

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,089
screen one I have different sensor like

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,280
an accelerometer a gyroscope and a

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:52,270
magnetic sensor so I'm measuring here

00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:56,140
the value as younger to the north and if

00:11:52,270 --> 00:12:04,630
I'm moving my box it will slowly

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:07,270
converge to the north direction so this

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,370
is a web sing dashboard and I have

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,089
different element I can control from it

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,360
like I have are so others and so on this

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:20,380
board like humidity pressure temperature

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,240
and also the joystick one you can move

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,830
in different direction it will trigger

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,820
events

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,710
and update this Adsense oh and as you

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,570
can see there is a matrix LED where I'm

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,930
defending is a novice direction but I

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:39,810
can also control all the headed II

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:45,850
change the colors of them let's move to

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:48,400
and also I can use this message property

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:56,880
and if I'm changing hit it will display

00:12:48,400 --> 00:13:01,380
hello from iw to so I'm indeed sensor

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:08,200
had on for this web sings sensor heart

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:10,420
for was brick by so if you want to get

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,490
started there is a simple example which

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,600
is a simulation but it's also working on

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:21,250
the actual device so I'm trying to

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:25,450
indicate the value of a sensor of solar

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,880
panel and I'm changing the color of the

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:33,210
syrup and on the roof of my model and

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,620
it's matching the the voltage level so

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:38,200
that's something and you can use as a

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,890
simulator also I have it running on the

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,410
microcontroller on stm32 board using IO

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,310
TGS but you can use this oh no not yes

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,730
it's quite easy to get started so what

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:55,300
you need to understand so once you

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:59,470
you're including the web thing bindings

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:03,790
to any frame library then you can insert

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:08,080
into your document a gltf 3d model and

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:11,140
then you can find a one property of so

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,630
here this is a solo parts which is part

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:18,520
of the house model and it's connected to

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:20,980
the web thing which is a given address

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,520
so here it's a rockin address but you

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,450
can use a device address also gateway

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,180
address so just need to be updated

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,140
so here I'm sharing our so some

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,900
additional resources you can get access

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,100
to the source code and if you can give

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,910
me some feedback about how it can I move

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,970
this project forward or try to make it

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,610
bigger for any different use case and um

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:56,190
so sponsorship is welcome feel free to

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:58,320
reach me on this addresses and if there

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:02,400
is an issue I we appreciate if you can

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,550
report them so thank you for everything

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,890
and now I'm open to any question if

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,040
there is any you can also reach me

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,040
