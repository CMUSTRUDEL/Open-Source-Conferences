00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,200
hello

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,450
this presentation will explain what

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,630
Richard is all about then we will take a

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,369
tour of the rich out bitter center so

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,279
what is rich out it's a support action

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,439
funded by the European Commission front

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,289
of a focus coordinates the project and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,769
the other two partners are or w-2 and

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,329
you share soft and by the way I'm Alex

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,670
from YCJA is often very happy to be

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,480
presenting reach out in or W to online

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,520
twenty so our goal at reach out is to

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,559
help European research projects in the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,289
area of software engineering develop

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,870
market value and reach out to the end

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,710
users by developing their own beta

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,890
testing campaigns also you can note that

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,489
Richard is also open to all European

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,680
SMEs and open source projects so

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,229
creating value for research projects

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,020
means more than simply producing project

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,630
deliverables this is what we call the

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,909
delivery challenge so there's many more

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,790
project attributes which are listed on

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,549
the slides which create value for their

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,250
project results as we will see better

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,590
testing helps developing those product

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,390
attributes and thus it increases the

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,060
market value of the project beta testing

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,970
is a key phase in a software development

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,979
cycle after the initial alpha version

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,650
which is internal to the project and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,110
before the product is ready the better

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,720
version is to be tested by external

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,689
end-users over a short period of time

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,710
this is what but a testing campaigns all

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:53,220
about so beta testing has a number of

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,079
benefits it provides a focus point that

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,229
helps align the efforts and the

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,729
expectations of the project partners but

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,710
that testing also provides feedback

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,710
which can be used to increase the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,719
quality of the product but the testing

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,330
helps enforcing those other necessary

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,360
product attributes such as documentation

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,209
and packaging and thus it increases the

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,569
project value

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:19,840
and finally the feedback provided by

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,629
external beta testers is very useful to

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,640
help identify future exploitation of the

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:30,280
project results so for our projects

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
being able to develop and implement its

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,719
own beta testing campaign is an

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,540
important milestone it proves that the

00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:41,290
project has what it takes to engage with

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,420
external actors users partners to bring

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,189
value to the market and to start

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,230
developing its own ecosystem so I reach

00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,480
out we have developed a whole five stage

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,180
methodology to help you implement your

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,400
own beta testing campaign that means

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,769
deciding the objectives of the campaign

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,200
and the role of the partner so basically

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,760
the strategy of the campaign it also

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,579
means preparing the software for beta

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,669
testing the testing scenario and the

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,590
questionnaire it also means writing

00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,469
documentation and communication material

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,430
and then engage engaging with beta

00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:21,090
testers and managing them and finally

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,620
analyzing the results and sharing them

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:28,930
so the whole methodology is available in

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,549
detail on the reach out website so reach

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,229
out provides you with tools and

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,139
templates for each of those building

00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,970
blocks so this is the R or the better

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,189
Center and will we'll take you through

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,079
those tools in the better Center tour

00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:46,569
shortly first campaign managers can

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,189
register on the beta Center they are

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,349
given their own campaign manager page

00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:53,409
from which they access the resources

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:56,409
that ReachOut provides them with in

00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:58,299
particular using the forum we provide a

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,209
campaign page can be automatically

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:05,349
generated together with the associated

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,599
questionnaire for beta testers we also

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,729
provide campaign managers with a

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,970
monitoring dashboard so these are 24

00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:15,189
checkpoints about the management about

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,859
the preparation and about the execution

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,389
of the campaign this dashboard can be

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,340
used to monitor the progress of the

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:24,039
campaign together with a retail product

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,090
team can be used to communicate with the

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:30,380
partners and also communicate

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,180
with the reviewers typically but a

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,430
distant campaign would take three to

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,280
five months with the first phase of

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,490
preparation of one to two months then

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,900
one to two months of execution that is

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,300
engaging with a better testers

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,830
themselves and finally one month for

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,169
analyzing the results so how'd you get

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,360
started well the first step is to go to

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,660
the Richard website and to register your

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,070
project then we will set up a call with

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,040
you to go through the Richard

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,020
methodology in details go through your

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,810
timeline and help you implement your but

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,620
a testing camping one important point

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,530
all of this is free so let's let's now

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,700
have a look at the reach out better

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:20,539
Center so this is the this is the reach

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,800
out at the center and it offers two

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:26,240
types of experience first for the for

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,190
the campaign and for the campaign

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,630
manager himself so the project leader

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,470
you can register as the campaign manager

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,940
so it's a self-service registration so

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,000
it's all self-service you just provide

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,669
your details and then you have access to

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,830
an account which will allow you to

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,510
register your campaign we will see that

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,430
in a minute

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:56,090
the second type of the second type of

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:59,419
experience is is that of the beta tester

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,950
so the better tester can check out a

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,470
number of campaigns that are available

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,810
so here we've got some so you've got the

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,639
current campaigns and below you've got

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:13,849
the past campaigns here on the platform

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,500
so let's now look at the material which

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:18,830
is which we have developed and which is

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,380
present on the beta Center so in the

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,650
better Center method a lot

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,550
methodology page you can find a superset

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,750
of the slides which I'm presenting now

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,080
so that's the super say or the slide

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,360
which includes more details

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,569
about the different elements of the

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,250
methodology there's also the methodology

00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:47,080
as a document which you can download and

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,819
and read in detail so the the table of

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:55,060
contents shows you the different steps

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:58,419
that we cover in the methodology so also

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,030
you can find in the better Center the

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,289
tools and templates that we've put

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,009
together for you so this contains

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,289
explanation about the monitoring

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:12,370
dashboard will show you that one in an

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:14,620
example in a few minutes it contains a

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,280
section about software packaging so

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:21,280
software packaging is an important

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,419
aspect of setting up together a better

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,279
testing campaign so from past experience

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,229
especially in the past project that we

00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:34,479
were involved with which was called a

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:38,590
pub we had to assemble together virtual

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,259
machines for various software and

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,090
software projects and often it's

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,940
happened to us that we did find some

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,639
instructions which sent us to a github

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,250
repository where there was a readme file

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,500
where the compilation instructions were

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,389
incomplete we're not working anymore and

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,599
so on and so forth so it's very

00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,529
important if you have if you have a

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:05,379
project to be tested and if you want

00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:07,389
better testing users but the testers to

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,360
be able to provide you with some

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,490
feedback that they're able to install

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,120
your software so this is an important

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,740
point here and reach out also provides

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,560
you with another tool called Richard

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,839
Factory which allows you to assemble

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,430
your project if you haven't got it if

00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,490
you haven't assembled your software yet

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,460
in a way that but the distance we'll be

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,610
able to use and so if we go if we go

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,800
back to the tools and templates we also

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,279
provide you with better documentation

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,810
checklist so this checklist takes you

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,150
through the necessary documents

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,040
and and documentation that you should

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:51,770
provide we also have a page about beta

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,500
tester incentives so this is a question

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,360
that we often have is how do you reward

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,510
better testers so we've done some

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,029
research on this and in fact but Addison

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,520
is nice needs to be acknowledged

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,140
rather than rewarded so rewarding is

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,190
good if you if you can so if you have a

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,470
free t-shirt but saying thank you and

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,630
recognizing them as good so reach out

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,820
we're organizing the Hall of Fame for

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,540
the better testers and we will put them

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,460
together forward on the platform there's

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,130
also more reading material that you can

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,750
find about ideas for rewarding your beta

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,730
testers then of course we have worked on

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,740
a better testing agreement so it's very

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,290
important when you gather feedback from

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,210
people that you respect the legislation

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,020
so there's a better testing agreement

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,660
that we have here which also contained

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,520
contains informed consent and of course

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,270
the data data protection page which you

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,430
can reuse so the campaign which page we

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,920
will see in a few minutes and the

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,510
questionnaires as well and the

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,950
communication package which we've put

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,410
together for you

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,839
contains a number of communication

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,480
material to be able to communicate about

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,430
your campaign recruit beta testers so a

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,110
few words on recruiting beta testers

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,290
that's a question that we often have is

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,960
how do you recruit them doesn't reach

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,670
out recruit them for us project order

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,160
the project do it so it's a bit it's a

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,200
bit of a mix actually so of course

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,760
through reach out we have registered a

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,530
number of projects we are in contact

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,100
with quite quite a few projects we've

00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,230
already done a campaign so they become a

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,450
source of beta testers themselves and

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,540
the first source of beta testers of

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,550
course is your project partners so that

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,980
includes for example if you have

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,080
academic partners all the students that

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,459
would work for the academic partners and

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,830
the researchers so there's a mix of beta

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,050
testers that we you will have access to

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,490
through reach out and beta testers that

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:57,860
you have through your current project

00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,520
so let's have a quick look at the better

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,030
center now I will log in as one of the

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,510
users so let's log in here as reach out

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:12,260
which has campaigned about reach out so

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,960
if I now go to my home page I can see

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,380
that I have a project called reach out

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,750
with which you can click here so in this

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,850
project I have one campaign called

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,530
testing the Richer platform so I can see

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,950
the details here which is organized in

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,300
section I can create a new campaign if

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,180
you want to because of course one

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,910
project might have several campaigns for

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,020
testing different software components

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,270
and I can take a look at the project

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,070
dashboard so the project dashboard as we

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,470
said earlier has three sections for the

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,550
management preparation and execution and

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:54,080
if I edit the dashboard for each of the

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,810
checkpoints I have here a tooltip which

00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,740
tells me what I should be looking

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:04,070
looking at in terms of actions to take

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,980
so that I can self assess myself so now

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:11,150
if I go back to if I go back to my

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:15,380
campaign I can take a look at the survey

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:18,320
itself so if I if I go to limesurvey

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,770
which is the tool here I can take a look

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,440
at the survey the survey has structure

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,290
with a number of questions each of those

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,820
are customizable the wording of it the

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,070
structure of it you can add and delete

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,880
questions if you want to there's no

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,310
problem and also I can look at the

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,950
results so if I want to look at the

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,070
responses I can take a look at the

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,840
statistics for example here and I can

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,500
view the statistics in a simple mode

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,230
that will show me the different answers

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,610
that I've received so far for my

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:58,490
campaign so so you can of course export

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:03,970
those questions in a spreadsheet type

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:08,020
mode if you want to so if we go back to

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,850
the presentation now note again that

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,230
although although ReachOut has been

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,540
funded by the European Commission for

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,880
its 2020 projects it's also open to all

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,330
European SMEs and open source projects

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,890
thus of course or EE to project so thank

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,750
