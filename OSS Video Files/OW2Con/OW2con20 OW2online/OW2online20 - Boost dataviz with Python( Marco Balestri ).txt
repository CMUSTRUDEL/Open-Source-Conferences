Playlist: OW2con20 OW2online
Description: 
	The new R/Python widget allows to embed R and Python scripts directly within a cockpit filling a gap between datavisualization and datascience. With this widget, datascientists are able to integrate python facilities in a heterogeneous and multi-source environment and to present advanced analytics to a broader audience.
