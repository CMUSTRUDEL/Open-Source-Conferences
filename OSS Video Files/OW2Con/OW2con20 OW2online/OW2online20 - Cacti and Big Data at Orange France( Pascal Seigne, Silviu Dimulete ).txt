Title: OW2online20 - Cacti and Big Data at Orange France( Pascal Seigne, Silviu Dimulete )

Description: 
	We propose a walkthrough of current utilization of Open Source Software in capacity planning for the Orange network infrastructure. The objective of our project is to have a platform that helps engineers to carefully plan the resources available to them as well as to correlate different incidents within remote parts of the infrastructure. In order to achieve this we started using Cacti with the Spine collector which worked great, but Orange France is a very large company with many entities, each with its own governance, and so we began to see some limitations. There was a need to centralize some information from different parts in Orange France as well as to integrate the equipment capacity and load values into BigData Orange. In order to achieve this we developed the “Puits de donneés” platform completely based on Open Source Software. The visualization and statistical analysis part is handled by Grafana while the ETL runs on Apache Software Foundation products like NiFi, Zookeeper and Ambari with a storage solution from MariaDB for which we did extensive performance tuning and customization due to the large amounts of data.
