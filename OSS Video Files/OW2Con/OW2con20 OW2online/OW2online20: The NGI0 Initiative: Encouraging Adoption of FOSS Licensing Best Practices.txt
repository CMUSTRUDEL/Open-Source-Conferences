	The NGI0 Initiative: Encouraging Adoption of FOSS Licensing Best Practices
( Gabriel Ku Wei Bin )
The Next Generation Internet Initiative is a funding action organized by the European Commission. It is intended to provide funding opportunities to developing technologies and software that has the potential to improve the internet's potential to be a platform that supports human values, such as privacy, transparency, inclusivity, and the protection of data. The results of these efforts are intended to be eventually made available as Free Software. The FSFE currently assists this Initiative, together with several other NGOs. The FSFE's role in particular is to encourage participant software projects to adopt best practices in displaying copyright and licensing information in their software projects. We estimate that the FSFE will have had to provide advice and guidance on how to properly display their license and copyright information to around one hundred small software projects involved in this Initiative. This presentation will talk about the NGI0 Initiative, the importance of proper license compliance, as well as share some patterns that we have observed on how developers of small, independent software choose to license their projects, and how they may deviate from best practices that can cause problems
