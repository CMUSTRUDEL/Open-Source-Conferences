Description: 
	The NGI0 Initiative: Encouraging Adoption of FOSS Licensing Best Practices
( Gabriel Ku Wei Bin )
The Next Generation Internet Initiative is a funding action organized by the European Commission. It is intended to provide funding opportunities to developing technologies and software that has the potential to improve the internet's potential to be a platform that supports human values, such as privacy, transparency, inclusivity, and the protection of data. The results of these efforts are intended to be eventually made available as Free Software. The FSFE currently assists this Initiative, together with several other NGOs. The FSFE's role in particular is to encourage participant software projects to adopt best practices in displaying copyright and licensing information in their software projects. We estimate that the FSFE will have had to provide advice and guidance on how to properly display their license and copyright information to around one hundred small software projects involved in this Initiative. This presentation will talk about the NGI0 Initiative, the importance of proper license compliance, as well as share some patterns that we have observed on how developers of small, independent software choose to license their projects, and how they may deviate from best practices that can cause problems

[Music]

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,719
hello everybody to give you an

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,400
introduction my name is Gabriel and I am

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,980
the legal coordinator at the Free

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,250
Software Foundation Europe or the fsfe

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,580
for short here in Berlin in Germany so

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
I'm not a developer I'm a lawyer my

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,119
interest when working with free software

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,640
is to try to ensure that the rights of

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,640
individuals both developers and users

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,460
are upheld when they participate in the

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,290
digital society we think that the best

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,649
way to achieve this is to use free

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,600
software which promises access

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,370
transparency and cooperation in digital

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,809
tools that we all have to use to

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,610
participate in society today so to that

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,039
end I'm here to talk about the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,770
next-generation internet also known as

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,410
the NGI initiative now this is a project

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,840
launched by the European Commission that

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,650
aims to shape what the internet will be

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,860
in the coming years now what exactly

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,900
does this mean so essentially it means

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,540
that the internet must be a platform

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,750
that embodies values that we hold dear

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,380
in a free and open society these are

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,570
values such as openness inclusivity

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,259
transparency privacy cooperation and

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,240
security such as the protection of data

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,310
the idea is that with these values in

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
place the Internet can be a platform

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,259
that supports human rights democracy and

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
a more progressive and enlightened

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,060
society I think that these are very

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
lofty goals indeed that we should all

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,229
aspire to when we develop digital

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,500
technology so how does the NGI

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,780
initiatives intend to do this the idea

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,909
is to provide assistance to individual

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
researchers and developers who are

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,350
working on new technologies or software

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,390
projects that have the potential to

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,270
contribute to the values of this new

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,340
Internet now this comes in the form of

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,069
both financial assistance and technical

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,470
assistance at the end of the involvement

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:18,360
with ngi the software will be made

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,670
available as free software so in order

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,720
to provide this assistance the NGI

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,720
initiative has set up ngi zero now ng ID

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,440
zero is basically a consortium of about

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,290
thirteen ngos of which fsfe is a member

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,550
now these organizations are focused on

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:42,600
various topics such as security

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,790
translations inclusivity etc etc they

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,760
will advise each successful applicant

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,290
project on their topic of expertise to

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,030
improve the project technical

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,209
proficiency in that area so there are

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,709
currently two actions in ng i0 nicknamed

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,370
pet and discovery

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:05,370
now the NGI zero privacy and Trust

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,550
enhancing technologies known as ngi zero

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,910
pet assist projects that are developing

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,200
privacy and Trust enhancing technologies

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,410
I'll give you an example of a successful

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,200
applicant to the pet prop program we

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,360
have an app called Briar involved now

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,030
breyer is a secure messaging app

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,700
designed with activists journalists

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,280
civil society groups and also persecuted

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,190
minorities in mind now these groups of

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,730
people often disengage with some aspects

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,200
of digital connectivity in modern life

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,709
in order to avoid intimidation

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,830
retribution surveillance and other types

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,799
of dangers so briar is a dedicated

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,230
communication tool that helps these

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,049
people that allows for people like this

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,090
to relay encrypted messages that are

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,480
synchronized directly between user

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,360
devices this protects users and their

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,190
relationships from surveillance and

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,600
Breyer is currently receiving assistance

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,450
to through the NGI initiative the NGO

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,709
search and discovery program or ng I

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,720
zero discover will assist software

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,169
projects that enhance user access to

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,509
search for and to discover information

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,520
the Internet so I'll give you an example

00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:27,090
of a software project involved here

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,999
called plot it now we tend to have

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,699
limited access to papers and academic

00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:35,279
articles from universities access to

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,889
scientific research attempts to be

00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,110
limited now this should not be the case

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,930
especially when this when these

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,439
universities are supported with public

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,840
tax money so plotted is a tool that

00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,379
allows the academic community to endorse

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,629
valuable and important research it makes

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:58,469
these endorsements available as open

00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:01,590
data so users of plotted users of these

00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:03,060
this tool can more easily discover and

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,520
disseminate scientific and academic

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:11,490
knowledge so how does it work for a

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,710
developer then now what happens is if

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,409
you are a developer of a new piece of

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,599
software that can fit into the

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:21,960
requirements of the pet or discovery

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:23,909
programs then you can apply to join now

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,789
every two months the programs will

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,009
evaluate the applications and accept a

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:32,189
new batch of approved software projects

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,740
if your project is accepted then you

00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,259
qualify to receive funding as well as

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,620
assistance from the NGI Xero consortium

00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,360
now when I say every two months the

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,389
programs will evaluate the applications

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,229
that means that the next deadline for

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:52,860
the current call for probe for projects

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:55,560
is on the 1st of June 2020 and if you

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,259
miss that deadline don't panic because

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,149
there will be another call the deadline

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:05,719
of which will be 1st of August 2020

00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:09,360
now what do you get from the FSA feeder

00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:11,729
for the fsfe our involvement is

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,000
basically to provide assistance with

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,560
free software licenses in particular we

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,839
want to make sure that for all the

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,469
successful applicants to the pet or

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,439
discovery programs firstly their license

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,389
information is accurate and secondly

00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,930
that they are presented in a manner that

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,020
is in accordance with best

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,550
practices and for us this is established

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,320
with fsfe he's reuse initiative now to

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,330
help ensure that license information is

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,360
accurately presented and that the

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,330
licenses within a project are compatible

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,400
we want to help develop we want to help

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,789
educate developers about free software

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,620
legal and licensing issues in order to

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,979
accomplish this we have developed a

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,990
series of FA cues on the basics of free

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,660
software legal and licensing issues

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,120
these are not only available for the

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,780
project participants but also to the

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,360
public at large so if any of you have an

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,599
interest in reading up on legal issues

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,970
related to free software you can visit

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,889
download fsfe org slash ng i0 and

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,690
download our documents for reading now

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,910
these documents will explain to you the

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,710
concepts of copyright the rights that

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,310
you have when you own a copyright over a

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:33,130
piece of code or software how developers

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,949
can license their software and the kind

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,289
of obligations that come with that now a

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,909
little word of warning we are currently

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,699
in the middle of cleaning up these

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:45,190
documents and we are still doing some

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:47,320
edits on them so there might be times

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,060
when either the page is down or the

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,979
documents are not available for viewing

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,560
temporarily

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,780
if so then apologies in advance but

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,729
please do be patient and they'll be up

00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,729
and running well soon enough

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,460
reuse compliance now another thing that

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,030
we will do is to check for reuse

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,750
compliance or what this means is that we

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,509
check that your license and copyright

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,599
information is displayed in accordance

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:22,240
with best practices now reuse and fsfe

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,250
initiative what it does is to spread

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
awareness of best practices for how to

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,500
display your license and copyright

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,759
information in free software projects

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,579
one problem that can happen with free

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,060
software projects is that when people

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:39,349
want to reuse elements of free software

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,779
and to incorporate it into

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,370
their own projects they don't include

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,370
the copyright and licensing information

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,959
in their repositories or it's not very

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,250
easy to find the urge to find a

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,639
standardized solution for this problem

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,880
was the impetus to create the reuse

00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,040
initiative it's to ensure that you can

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,829
easily find out what a license

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,839
what license a file is licensed under

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:11,389
and who owns the copyright so reuse has

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,190
a linter tool which you can run in your

00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,509
repositories to make sure that your

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,750
license information is properly

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:20,690
displayed now if you're involved in the

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,750
NGI 0 program we will help you run this

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,250
litter tool on all the projects to check

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,589
if they are adopting these best

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,199
practices and then we will make

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:36,170
recommendations on how each project can

00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:38,480
improve so yes get involved and apply if

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,360
you are currently working on a software

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,910
project that fits these criteria that

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,040
fits the criteria of the next generation
