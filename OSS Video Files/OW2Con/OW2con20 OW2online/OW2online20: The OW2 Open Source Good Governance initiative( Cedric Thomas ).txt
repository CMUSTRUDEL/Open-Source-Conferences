00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,460
good morning this presentation is about

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,160
the good governance initiative that uh

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,520
w2 is launching today at other we do

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,670
online at the w2 an initiative is a

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,400
joint effort by members and non-members

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,439
to address a market need the need we

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,199
addressing here is that of large end

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,010
users to implement open-source

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,420
governance policies and the whole

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,600
session this morning after the great

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,879
online is in fact an outcome of these

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,610
good governance initiative and most of

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,260
the speakers today are participants in

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,250
the initiative so what I want to do

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,390
today is look at the context that

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,199
managers in charge of implementing good

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,379
governance policies are confronted to so

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,510
we will look at what is the state of the

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,210
open source industry that are looking at

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,290
and what are the key challenges and then

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,060
we will identify the main trends and

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,110
priorities of the good governance

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,590
initiative so the general consensus is

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,930
that a purchases want not so much at the

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,610
level of the operating systems but

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,500
rather the whole information system and

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,580
that's what we are to do we - we call

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,290
full-stack open source so that means

00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,850
there is openness everywhere but that

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,060
doesn't mean that open source is the

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,880
same everywhere and in fact the open

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,670
source supply we confronted to comes

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,799
from four different models that have

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,270
emerged over the last thirty years the

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,009
first model is that of the the community

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,729
open source or the free open source

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,070
that's the model by developers and for

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,380
developers that has given us some of the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,810
best and the most popular open source

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,719
components for instance the internet

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,869
would not run without opera software

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,550
developed by these communities the third

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,379
the second model is that of the

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,660
commercial open source so free software

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,180
in the 80s certainly 80s

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,470
in the middle of the 90s became

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,400
commercial open source and commercial

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,800
open source is carried by companies by

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,670
software vendors that leverage the open

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,250
source business model to compete again

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,190
proprietary software vendors so these

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,940
have changed the the shape of the

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,430
software industry and then towards the

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,400
2010 with cloud computing and everything

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,260
being interconnected and all innovations

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,170
being dependent on other innovations out

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,720
there something else something else

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,910
happened that large companies whose name

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,160
would never be identified with open

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,050
source software started to open so their

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,880
own technologies and they started to

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,910
team up together to invent new

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,630
technologies and this is the whole cloud

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,670
computing wave literally was fueled by

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:11,230
collaborative efforts by by large

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,530
companies leveraging the the benefits of

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,390
open source as a vehicle for

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,410
collaborative innovation and that's what

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:23,350
I call open source by committees where

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,740
trends and decisions are made completely

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,350
collectively the next level will happen

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,660
like a year or couple of years ago with

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,760
big money coming into open source

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,920
software open source being recognized as

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,730
part of the industry traditional board

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,310
members representing function firms and

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,350
people you would not suspect to be

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,060
open-source activists have authorized

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:51,550
the manageress to invest billions of

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:56,320
dollars in open source companies it's

00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:00,570
not so much the Microsoft acquiring on

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,209
github or IBM acquiring red hat but also

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:07,360
investments in startups and valuations

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:11,860
of approaches companies beyond the 1 or

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,140
2 billion dollar thresholds today we

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,520
have in fact four models at play

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:20,680
concurrently so as a manager in charge

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,640
of implementing a new purchase

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,980
governance policy organization it's

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,260
important to understand that there is

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,030
not just one open source which is the

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,820
community open source by and for

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,890
developers but that we also have open

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,450
source provided by the big companies and

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,760
also open source provided by commercial

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,130
software vendors that use this open

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,320
source business model and that's

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,900
something that is this

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,120
it's a tailor Genuity that has to be

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,180
taken into consideration so I would say

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,850
this is the state of open source

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,640
supplier I mean the the the high level

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,430
vision of open source of ply and today

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,270
these approaches context is confronted

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:10,240
to what I would call crucial challenges

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,200
and I identified ten of those so the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,560
first challenge is of course about

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,350
reusing those components and knowing

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,430
what is in the component that we reuse

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:28,150
so controlling the software that you you

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,370
reuse in terms of its security in terms

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,380
of its license or in terms of

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,980
functionally that it doesn't break the

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,690
the rest of the software development

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,060
cycle this is something very important

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,720
and there are tools for that the next

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,640
challenge is that posed by software

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,090
as-a-service the software is a service

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,680
model takes away control from the code

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,680
to the service and where in-house teams

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,010
we used to control the code they have to

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,820
end over the control of their

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,430
applications to service providers and

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,250
where Sasson cloud computing takes

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,980
control away from the cloud to the

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,060
services the next challenge is that

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:20,410
posed by artificial intelligence that

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:23,080
takes away control from the program to

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:27,040
the data artificial intelligence is

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,400
fueled by data and the the center of

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,990
gravity is shifted from the program to

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,440
the data and programming becomes in a

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,870
way secondary the next challenge is that

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,530
posed by IOT

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,949
the fragmentation of opportu software we

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,590
out of a comfort zone of middleware and

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:56,050
operating systems and now we are having

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:59,110
we seen open-source into into segments

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,020
that are very fragmented into very

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,229
business specific applications or into

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,990
very Hardware specific specifications

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:11,050
and that fragmentation limits the

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,910
possibilities for utilization which is

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:17,260
the basis for open source software next

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:22,050
that's what I call deviation those

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:25,110
deviations come from the opportunistic

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,700
use of operative software to create

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,290
foundations in order not so much to do

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,479
open source software but actually to

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:38,010
create technologies that would work

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:41,139
together and would take prevalence

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,090
market market positions so these are not

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,130
really open source organizations these

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,490
are really technology and business

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,990
organizations made for grabbing market

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,389
shares and now there is another

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,250
deviation from the in the open source

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,070
software which comes from a new

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,940
interpretation of those licenses saying

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,580
that current open source licenses are

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:07,630
obsolete and that now we need to get to

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:10,180
the stage where we we need licenses that

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,820
control exactly what we do with the

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,300
software and that is something that I

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:20,889
feel is beyond the scope of what

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:23,410
opposite is about next there is that of

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,590
the free right Free Riders so you know

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:31,479
the tragedy of the Commons exaggerated

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,080
used by by by consumers or uses of free

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,039
resources

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,260
he leads to the reign of these resources

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,089
now I would look at this from the

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,849
standpoint of our ecosystem and I would

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:48,790
say that consumers who don't give back

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:50,589
to the communities tend to to wring this

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,140
to wring the supply of open source of

00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,460
software so the idea the whole point

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,430
here is that of

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,460
having a sustainable ecosystem and it

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:05,050
comes from not being a free rider next

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,310
is related to the shape of the the

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,340
structure of the industry

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,130
well operative software is an avatar of

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,510
the proprieties of our industry and the

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,970
property software industry being

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,400
dominated by the North America industry

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,700
operative software is also kind of

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,550
driven by North American interest next

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,490
also we have to pay attention to is that

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,990
of thinking that a purchasers one and

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,150
that everything is going to be open

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,910
source no no no open source only

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,100
represents 15% of the whole software and

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,470
service industry it may be a question of

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,470
monetization and measuring the value but

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,380
the thing is the thing remains that the

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,180
the center of gravity of the whole IT

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,980
industry is not in open source and that

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,990
has to be taken into consideration as

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,970
well and talking about the industry you

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,370
have to understand also the structure of

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,840
this industry there are many companies

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,380
large companies small companies

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,930
it's an implication of ecosystems and

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,350
what's important here is to understand

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,900
that some companies are Keystone players

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,450
with their hands in mainly ecosystems

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,400
and that other companies may be niche

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,530
players very important but belonging to

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,290
us on the one ecosystem that helps

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,850
understand who we are dealing with and

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:26,710
help understand how we engage with our

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:31,300
ecosystems and the last one is the trend

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,230
next challenge is the trend to to

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,130
outsource

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:40,870
IT operations also seeing tends to take

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:43,450
away control and culture from inside

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,890
from the the company development teams

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:51,250
to the IT service provider or the LT

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:54,190
outsourcing service provider and to and

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,860
the thing is governance policy has

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,350
something very cultural in it and it's

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,920
difficult to have a governance policy of

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:05,260
full fledged governance policy if when

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,089
when most of the IT is being outsourced

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,889
so having said that

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,649
and looking at this context and from the

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,660
standpoint of audibility to our position

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:17,199
in the European ecosystem and our

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,269
members we realized that there was

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:21,100
something we could do there was

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,259
something you could do because open

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,529
source is there there is a question of

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:30,399
maturity you grow with open source

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:33,069
you'll learn to use it and controlling

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,350
or defining this learning curve is

00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:39,790
something that that that matters and

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,519
from our perspective attitude ability to

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,680
we wrote about a year ago that we felt

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,990
it was important to look after our

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,079
European ecosystem and that contributing

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,300
back would be on behalf of the large

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,209
changes is a good thing to do so we've

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,540
had discussions over a year and a half

00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:02,910
and these discussions led to identify

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,559
three key needs or key key drivers so

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:09,249
the first one was that there was a need

00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,819
for more large end users to raise the

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:14,860
kulluk collective level of expertise in

00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:19,179
reusing and using open source software

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,819
and that many of these were isolated in

00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:24,699
different countries and that having a

00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:28,959
way to share this expertise would be a

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:32,079
very useful thing to do the the second

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:36,459
needs identified for inaccessible

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,259
organization the the thing was that most

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,819
of our participants were saying that

00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,350
large organizations dominus

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,389
organizations are not easy to do

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,749
business with and that they needed an

00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:49,269
organization that resembled them and the

00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:52,540
third results of this that was in it to

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,839
have something that is euro centric euro

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,410
centered so for these reasons we felt

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,889
that other blue could be the neutral

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,860
ground

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:05,139
where we could develop this initiative

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,319
and where we could host these

00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:10,240
discussions and help grow the collective

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,540
level of expertise in using open source

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,459
among large European companies because

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,500
we are European organizations for

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:20,930
European DNA we have the experience

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:26,300
being fronted in 2007 and we also have

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:29,149
a global global reach and a device event

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,180
code based that would be the proper

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,520
backdrop for these discussions the next

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,890
thing to do is to identify what was out

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,750
there there was no way we would reinvent

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,810
the wheel and the whole point was to

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,330
leverage what already existed but we

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:48,350
realized that what already existed was

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:51,380
in fact centered on providing tools the

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,410
tooling level and we felt that in open

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,540
source initiative tooling was only one

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,360
of the different layers that we would

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,790
look at so we are very happy to engage

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,529
with all the initiative that exists and

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,080
especially this morning in the

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:09,320
presentations we have presentations of

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,450
but the open tool chain open chain from

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,600
Lynx Foundation and the tools by DT

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:19,399
simulation so we we are happy to

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,410
cooperate but we want also to to go a

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,360
little beyond and going beyond would

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:30,860
mean for us to leverage a this kind of

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:34,040
model that we borrow from psychologists

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,010
called Maslow that identified a pyramid

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,560
yah-tchi yah-tchi of needs and this

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,779
charity needs identify five levels the

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,050
basic needs for I mean just survival

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:47,650
living eating and being alive the next

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,860
level is the need for doing this

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:55,610
security so the security needs the third

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:59,029
level is that of being in a society of

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,730
belonging to to society and engaging

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,400
with other people the next level is

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:07,190
about being recognized so is having some

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,950
recognition for what we do and the fifth

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,670
level is that of pure nirvana is the

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:17,950
full the whole fulfillment so we are

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:20,450
borrowing from this hierarchy to

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,750
identify the different levels different

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,940
maturity levels in terms of opposites

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,250
governance policies so the first one the

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,370
first level that we need to have is that

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,130
of a using open source and using open

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,209
source means technically using it having

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,369
a certain

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,160
days of open source software having

00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,839
people able to use this open source

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,100
software so first of all that's the

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,740
first layer is that exist and often this

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,379
layer is being developed in a way that

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,389
is a bit uncontrolled so take back

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:56,389
control on this is the first thing to do

00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:59,480
the second layer is that of using open

00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:02,029
source with security securely and that

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,910
is using the tools and that's all the

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:08,300
tools that we are looking at today to

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,269
manage a security to manage license

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:15,470
compliance or to manage dependencies so

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:17,149
as to not to break the not to damage

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,279
functionally the the software that is

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:22,699
being developed now the next level is

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,519
that of belonging and there we see we

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:28,689
see that in terms of identifying where

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,660
we are where we are by comparison to

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:34,429
similar companies and identifying what

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,589
is the state of the art in governor

00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:40,249
opens with governance and developing

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:42,079
this culture and sharing best practices

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,309
and implementing them so that's

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,089
something that the good governance

00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,529
initiative would really make where

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,480
whether good goodness initiative would

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,369
like to make a difference that the next

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,149
step where we would be a little bit

00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:58,639
activist at the w2 is to make sure that

00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,189
those participant engage with the

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,360
ecosystem and participate develop their

00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:07,640
own visibility and help create and

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,970
enhance the level and the market power

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,880
of the European ecosystem and the the

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:17,839
fifth level that of fulfillment would be

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,569
that of having open source fully

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,319
recognized as a strategic asset by

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,089
companies and fully contributing to the

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,960
to the competitiveness and profitability

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,750
of the companies so with that this is

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,630
the framework for the good governance

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,039
initiative that we are organizing we're

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,080
launching it we're leveraging the

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,730
concept of open source program office ah

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,760
SPO that captures what it's a good

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,640
contact for

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,250
developing governance policies and the

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,799
priorities that we have identified was

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,190
first of all to help grow this auto

00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,450
concept or organizations within our

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,470
participants the next one is to address

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,950
developers to make sure that we have

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,130
responsible developers and we're

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,620
developing as a training syllabus for

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:16,330
that training syllabus that will also be

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:22,830
useful for opposite governance managers

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:27,370
the next priority is to identify and

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,370
create a set of resources for managing

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,919
compliance and sourcing and this is what

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,150
really the session today is about

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,299
identifying all the resources for

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:40,600
implementing governance policies and the

00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:42,190
next priority is really to to engage

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,429
with the European Commission so that

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:48,370
together with audibility to the European

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:52,419
Commission and the end-user Largent

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:55,090
users we engage with the EU open source

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,470
ecosystem to make sure that we have a

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:02,080
virtual environment that is sustainable

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,120
and provides good and secure and

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,220
reliable open source software so that's

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,140
what the good governance initiative is

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,799
about and we will be developing our

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,919
activities throughout the next few years

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
