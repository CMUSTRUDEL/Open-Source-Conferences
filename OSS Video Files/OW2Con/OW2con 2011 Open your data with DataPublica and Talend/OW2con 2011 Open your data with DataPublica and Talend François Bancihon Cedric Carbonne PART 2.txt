as I said at data pública we have this

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,529
beautiful search engine so go go there

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,570
and play with the data and find what

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,639
data is available you can rinse the 26

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,280
and so on but we also need to make money

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,400
okay so we have two revenue lines today

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,880
revenue line number one is we develop

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,220
for customers customized data sets so a

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,760
customer comes to us and say I want such

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,010
and such information okay so either this

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,019
information already exists and we point

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,829
them there or the information does not

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:39,270
exist and we develop the data okay so as

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,790
as company used to build software for

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,160
the customers now they're going to also

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,600
build data okay I want this data can you

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
find it for me so let me take one

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,030
example we're currently building for a

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,079
customer the data sets of all public

00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:00,750
tenders in France so there is we found

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,320
around 8,000 sources that published

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,650
those call public calls for submission

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,500
tenders so we've identified the 8,000

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,040
sources the idea is to crawl them every

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,570
morning to extract data to reprocess the

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,659
data to extract meaningful information

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,640
from there to deduplicate the data and

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,409
to deliver that to the customer every

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,080
morning so that's one example of the

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,470
data set the beauty of this data set is

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,450
of course that people want to subscribe

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,600
to the result because the data is coming

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,820
every day just like water is coming out

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,310
of your tab from the from the utility

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,500
company so that one business we do and

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,829
usually this discuss timaeus data set

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,470
development relies on our ability and

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,200
our knowledge on existing data and our

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,960
knowledge on the technology jointly with

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,329
talent to deliver the data based on the

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,460
set of tools okay the second thing we do

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,969
is we're building something called a

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,280
data store so so you know about the App

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,039
Store where the App Store changed the

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,660
world because it sends the way

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,970
applications were delivered to you and

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,170
application were sold to you we plan to

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,489
do the same thing with

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,760
store that will centralize all charged

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,700
for data available so that you can

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,239
access it find it and deliver it so we

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,790
are currently rounding up people who

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,540
sell data and who are ready to sell it

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,880
on the data store so so there's a new

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,630
market which is called the open data

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,700
market there's new players everybody's

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,400
wondering exactly what will happen who

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,180
will be the players what will be the

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,430
price is what will be the the channels

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,620
and so on and we're all in the process

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,290
of learning okay but obviously there is

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,220
a strong need more and more for company

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,190
so with talent we are proposing to

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,530
address three types of requests the

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,190
first one is public or private

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,530
organization who want to open that data

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:13,110
ok so today for instance in in France

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,660
there is a number of cities such as

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:21,060
Paris north west Bob dome or PDA

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,090
marseille etc who are following this

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,829
open data policy how do you follow an

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,220
open data policy you have to first

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:31,049
identify what data you have most public

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,390
organization barely know what they have

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,810
the second thing is you have to extract

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,730
the data from where it is okay and

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,579
extracting data means ETL tool for

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,890
instance in some cases if you want to

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,290
bring data which is in good condition

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,680
you have to clean up the data make it

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,320
consistent and so on so all these people

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,989
who have this problem of extracting data

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,780
making it available to people providing

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,410
search engine on them providing tools to

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:05,190
visualize the data need to need to

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,290
answer those those technical requirement

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,950
and that's the first one we plan to

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,810
address the second one is we plan to

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,850
address organizations that are in need

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,789
of a specific data set which is what I

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,880
explained you're looking for some data I

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:24,150
will find it for you or for instance the

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,650
last week west we had is this guy come

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,710
and

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,750
eh I have this list of companies there's

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,630
a better you know a few hundreds of them

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,940
I would like to find all the investors

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:39,470
of this company in these companies and

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,210
the share they all invested okay so the

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,669
first look at that and say well that's

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,430
private data actually no this is public

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:48,080
data it's publicly available data the

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,449
process by which you extract this

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,060
publicly available data is fairly

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,919
complex you have to identify it you have

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,260
to clean it up you have to extract it

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,810
you have to compose it you have to check

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,330
it that's another example so all the

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,910
technologies that talent has been

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:09,740
developing for four years are in fact

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,039
relevant to most of these steps okay and

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,650
then the last the last step is actually

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,440
helping organization to make good use of

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,570
data and we you know we are coming back

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,310
to essentially the main topic of this

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,280
session okay so technologies needed are

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,199
the following etl obviously because step

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,180
one is extracting the data data quality

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,840
all tools that help us clean up the data

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,440
even though okay let's be careful we

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,139
believe that open data very often means

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,229
give me the dirty data you have today

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,789
okay please do not tell me you have to

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:53,810
clean it up before you give it to me

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:57,320
okay after all after all if your data is

00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,470
dirty actually it's the data you use so

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:05,380
i will be happy to see it as you use it

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:08,360
no but still if in the process of

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,240
opening your data you could clean it up

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,490
everybody would benefit from that

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,740
obviously bi tools are essential because

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,389
when people look at data most of the

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,710
time they don't understand it or it's

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:24,050
very boring so if you can provide

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:28,070
interesting VI to all so that people can

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,680
understand Anna licensee when we started

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,449
doing open data at data pública we

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,580
thought we were essentially doing open

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:36,320
data we're discovering more and more

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,510
every day that we actually

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:46,090
doing big data as we are slowly moving

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:48,830
all our data into a no SQL database we

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,920
discovered that the size and the amount

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,770
of data we processing is getting totally

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,590
out of bound using traditional

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,980
technology which means that you know no

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,710
SQL a dupe and and n MapReduce are

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:08,000
technologies that are at the heart of

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:11,630
what we do we recently imported in in

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,670
the data public directory all the data

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:19,250
from eurostat it actually starts by i

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,980
think it's it's a few tens of gigabytes

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,860
as soon as you structure it in the way

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,140
so that you can search it and and and

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,060
align it it's turning into a terabyte

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,550
okay so very quickly you're getting

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,180
there directory management is essential

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,110
and data integration because the key of

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,930
making good use of this data is actually

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,870
to recognize that in this data set and

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,170
in this data set the same notions of lie

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,230
and can be converted conclusion that's a

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,820
new and exciting market I you know and

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,070
encourage you to understand what's going

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,840
on there is a political dimension there

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,690
is a legal dimension there is a citizen

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,230
dimension there's a technical dimension

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,840
there's a business one so I'm you know

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,750
it's really exciting it's fun you

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,720
discover new stuff follow us on Twitter

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,900
you will not very interesting and I

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,630
think that the joint technology of

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,800
talent and data pública will be perfect

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,800
