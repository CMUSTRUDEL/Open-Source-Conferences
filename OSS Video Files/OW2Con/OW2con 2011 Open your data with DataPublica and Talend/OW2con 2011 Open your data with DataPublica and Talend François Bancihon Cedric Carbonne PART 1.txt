	00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
so just

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,360
two or three slides about about thailand

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
so

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
our goal in fact is to develop and

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,960
democratize some markets

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,640
the first one in orange is a data

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
quality data profiling

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,279
so in fact it detects some some issue in

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,840
your in your data

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
the second one is data integration it

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,160
includes

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,079
etl extract transform loading to load

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,040
your data warehouse for example

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,040
but also to

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,000
update your data to manipulate your data

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,200
to cleanse your data et cetera mdm

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
stand for master data management uh is

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
to manage

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
uh all your master data like your

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,399
customer

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
your contract and to be sure you are a

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
good quality

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,239
inside this uh this data and if you

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
co-write

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,719
uh thanks for example things in tune

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
tools sorry uh your data

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
to distribute to distribute all the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
change to ch

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,880
to share all the change uh with your uh

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,479
information system

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,920
and the last one in green is uh esb

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,200
enterprise service bus it's to be able

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
to um

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,400
deploy and to uh and to share easily

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,520
uh service with all the pieces

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,439
in your information system so

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,799
that means for example if you create a

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,920
data cleansing job you can

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
change it as a service and deploy it and

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
it can be

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,640
reachable by any kind of application it

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,079
can be your erp but it can be also a php

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
program etc extra

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
our goal is to have something easy and

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,560
simple to use

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,719
just two screenshots uh to show you how

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,240
it works

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,560
so we have an at least base environment

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
so you just drag and drop some component

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
for example file component uh salesforce

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,720
component etc

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
you will just extract your data and

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
after you will

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
map thanks to team up uh your data you

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
will transform your data

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,920
and after put in your in your output

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
and just a quick preview of a t-map the

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
t-map is a component when you will drag

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,760
and drop

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,400
all the data and you will do some some

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
changes

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,239
inside your data so

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,040
now we have some tools to transform data

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,480
let's speak about

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,959
open data so let me explain a little bit

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,640
uh what we do at data publica data

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,760
publica is a brand new company we

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
started in july

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
we're about seven people right now so

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,599
small

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,319
and uh starting so the first thing we're

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,599
doing is

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,920
uh we are currently collecting

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,200
and building the most complete and

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
detailed

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
information about electronic data

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,800
available

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,879
in france so we're focusing on france

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
so when we talk about data we talk about

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
public data and private data

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
we talk about free data and charge for

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
data

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
and we talk about regional data national

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
data

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:27,519
european data so we're trying to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,080
find everything that's available there

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
and each time we find something we bring

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,799
it to our

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,920
directory we index it we extract

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,680
metadata information and then we index

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,640
the whole enchilada on both

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,879
metadata and data so today we've

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,239
collected

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,879
a little more than 10 000 data sets

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
so these data sets cover all kinds of

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,920
topics

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,280
demography geography economics

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,879
sociology names of people

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,040
etc etc addresses blah blah blah

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
for each one of them we've collected

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,680
metadata and data

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
and we maintain all this updated which

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,519
means

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
as the data evolves as things are

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
restructured

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,560
we either refresh the data we have

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
or we archive the data so that you will

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
find

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,320
interesting data available so

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,360
summarize we doing this we are the the

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
quote unquote google of uh structured

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
data

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,960
uh available so that you can search

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,199
and we don't make a penny doing that

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,320
because it's available

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,240
online so you can go there

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,759
you can search both on data and metadata

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
so you can find

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
everything that says something about

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
paris

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,080
and and john smith or you can find

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,080
anything that talks about

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,560
ages names and salaries and so on okay

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
so and then you'll have facets to search

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
the stuff

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
and so on so it's interesting to wonder

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
how much

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,400
data is available out there we did a

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,120
search and tried to measure the amount

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
of

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,680
the number of data sets currently

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,120
publicly available on the web

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,759
in european countries okay our

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,280
estimate for francis there is 6.5

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
millions of those

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,960
okay uh so which sounds good

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
except that uh you will quickly discover

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
the 6.5

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,000
out of the 6.5 million 5.5 is pdf

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,080
okay so it's an almost unusable data but

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,400
a lot of people make use of this data

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,520
okay if you look at purely tabular data

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,240
there's about 200 000 pieces of that

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,520
and if you look at xml data there is

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,440
about half a million of xml data

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,440
which when you search a little bit

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,600
further is disappointed because a lot of

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,039
the xml data is actually

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,600
textual data with a few flag in there

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
so you can equate that at the european

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
level

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
there is tens of millions of available

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,400
data

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,199
and a few millions of

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,199
tables the the interesting challenge is

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,039
try to do something with all this

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
open data is something that started

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,400
something like in 2009

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,160
in the us at the initiative of the obama

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
administration

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,759
and and here is the principal idea so

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
public sector

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,000
information which means the information

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
that is

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
by don't miss your training okay the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,919
informa

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,720
the data that is collected maintained

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,880
and used by government organization

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
should be made available to citizens and

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,479
businesses for access and reuse so

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,319
citizens we mean you and i you should be

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,000
able to go out there and find

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,919
what the government on what

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,319
does the government base its decision

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,720
what data does it have and so on

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
uh so that's true for citizen it's true

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,800
obviously for the press

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
and there is a whole branch steaming

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
from this which is called

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
data journalism which means the press

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,880
accessing

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,880
interesting data and and building

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
interesting analysis from that

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,360
and of course citizens group who can

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,759
gather this data this data should also

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,199
be available to businesses

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
and mainly to either run their business

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,199
or invent

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,000
new models and and uh it's true that

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,160
most of the application that run on this

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
kind of things today

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,400
actually use uh public data

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
in terms of uh maps and uh

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,560
and data available so that they can

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
build stuff transport data et cetera et

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
cetera

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
so the motivation for making things

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,440
available is numerous the number one

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,360
is uh what was paid by the taxpayer

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
belongs to the taxpayer so you already

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,639
paid for it

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
the second thing is uh the political

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,280
idea of transparency show me

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
what you have show me the truth and

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
maybe i can trust you more

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
okay and the second thing is economic

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,680
because

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
there's a strong belief that by making

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
this data

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
available you will help businesses

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,599
making wiser decisions

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
and eventually you will have new

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,800
businesses

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,919
building new business model around that

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,240
okay so all this is for

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,279
public information and there are

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,120
currently

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,320
laws in in most of uh uh

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,279
democracies on earth that that

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,200
push administration we say push okay

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
because it's not done yet it's coming

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
but the uh

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,240
the trend is obviously there and there

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
is more and more

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,040
public data available everything so the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,839
principle of open data

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,800
can be applied for entirely to companies

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,279
so it makes sense for a company to make

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,320
data available once again for the same

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,480
reason the first one is transparency

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
i can trust this company because i know

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,040
what they have i know

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
uh what they do etc etc so it's a good

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,680
it's it's bringing a good

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
image there and and uh bringing a trust

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
relationship between the company and its

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,720
uh

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,080
customers or users okay and the second

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,600
thing is

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,120
economics because it's a smart thing to

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,760
build around yourself a an ecosystem of

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,000
people

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,760
who can do intelligent things with your

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
business okay so for instance

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
the public transportation companies if

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
they are make

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
if they make their data available about

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
schedules and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,240
positions of of buses and

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,720
subways etc can see

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,920
companies building interesting apps and

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
and uh

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,279
around them and helping their customer

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,279
