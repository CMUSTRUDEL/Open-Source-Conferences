hi

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,920
i'm cedric thomas i'm the ceo for w2 and

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,080
in this presentation i'm going to

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
introduce the good governance initiative

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
that

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
was launched at aw2kcon

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,519
20 last june

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,439
at w2 an initiative is a joint effort by

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,080
members and non-members to address

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
market need and in this case it's the

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,040
need to properly develop open source

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,360
policies within large organizations

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,960
so we had three drivers behind the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
launch of this initiative

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
the first one was the recognition that

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
large end users

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
all had different ways to implement open

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
source and that there was not they were

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
not

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
sure of what was the state of the art in

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
this uh

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
in this area and we all needed to build

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,559
to raise our collective expertise

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
so the second driver was that to do that

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
we needed

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,600
a neutral ground and that aw2 as a

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
european organization

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
uh open source organization could be the

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,280
right place to do that

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,000
so the and the third goal was that

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
of the we needed a european perspective

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,479
because there is a strong connection

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,920
between using open source software

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
in order to develop some uh degrees of

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,040
liberties

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,080
and of course being once control of

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
a digital sovereignty so we were

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,680
inspired by

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,560
a model developed by abraham maslow

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
of human behavior priorities that

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
identify

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,880
different i mean priorities bottom it's

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,520
a bottom-up hierarchy of priorities

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
with at the bottom the basic uh

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
priorities which are to be able to

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
survive to eat and sleep

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
um the next level has the priorities to

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,399
do this in a

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
secure environment then to be recognized

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,600
in the group

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,360
than to be socially recognized and then

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,799
the top priorities are to be able to

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,880
control one's life

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,920
so we reused this

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
to build a model a maturity model

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
for open source usage open source

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,120
governance

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,080
with five key goals one goal being

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
the usage goal the basic one then the

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
trust goal

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
then the cultural goal then the

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
engagement goal

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,640
and then the strategic goal these goals

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
are contributed to or supported by what

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,239
we call activities

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
and these activities are described and

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,080
monitored by what we call

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,760
scorecards so the usage goal

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,879
is the goal to be able to

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,440
control but to have the basic skills

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,239
in using open source software and

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
understanding and being aware of all the

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
this technological environment that is a

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,760
bit specific to open source

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,760
the next goal the trust goal is to be

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,120
able to use operator software develop

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,519
produce integrated

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,640
software but risen responsibly

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,120
and and safely so it's all about

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,319
legal compliance about managing

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,440
vulnerabilities

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,120
and about managing software dependencies

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
and using the right tools to

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
be able to do that efficiently so that's

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
the second goal

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
the third goal is what we call the

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
culture goal

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,280
is to make sure that the individuals

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,159
don't do that in isolation within their

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
own organization

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,760
in the silo but are aware

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
that they belong to the open source

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
community at large

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,640
that they can communicate with other

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,159
developers

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,959
other organizations share concerns share

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,239
expertise

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,799
and be able to leverage the power of all

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
this

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,200
networking that the opposite community

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
is offering

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,120
the next goal is the engagement goal so

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,000
that's is more from a

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,040
corporate perspective the idea here is

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
to make sure that

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
users system integrators are not just

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
consumers of

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,000
open source software but that they

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
contribute back they give

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
back to the country they give back to

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
the communities

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,199
and contribute to the open source

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
ecosystems

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,280
and its sustainability

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,919
and the the last goal is the strategy

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,199
goal

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
the idea here is to make sure that open

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
source

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,479
is recognized at the top levels of an

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,240
organization's management

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,600
as an enabler of new process innovations

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,360
of digital transformation and of digital

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,639
sovereignty

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
so with that we have a comprehensive

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
blueprint

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
for implementing and managing an open

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
source policy

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,360
with the tools to monitor the progress

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
and also to share this progress to

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
report the progress to other met to

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,039
other managers

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,880
so how how you can get in on it well

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,960
it's easy you just go to the audible

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
website to the open source good

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,880
governance

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,720
initiative page and you join the

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
resource center that we've put together

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
there

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,880
and especially the mailing list so this

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,880
is how you can

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
get in on it and then you can access to

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,759
how we built the whole blueprint

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,600
with the different technical resources

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
that we have set up behind that

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
so with that i'm looking forward to

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,759
seeing you there

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,759
