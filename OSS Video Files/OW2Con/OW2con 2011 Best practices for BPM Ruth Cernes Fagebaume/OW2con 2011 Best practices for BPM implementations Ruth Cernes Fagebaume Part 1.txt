	Speaker: Ruth Cernes Fagebaume, BonitaSoft
Abstract:
Business Process Management (BPM) is the discipline focused on optimizing the efficiency of a business. Although Business Process Management implementation has many immediate and long-term benefits, a poor start can jeopardize the overall success of the mission. This talk will address good practice that help ensure the success of an organization's BPM implementation while minimizing the possibility of any potential setbacks.

I am however from the new yourself to

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,780
couldn't be said about a Ferengi service

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,790
officer the label

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,880
so just imagine I'm just above it and

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,660
he's taking a speaking see you is going

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,150
to write still so apart from being being

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,400
a founder of the company public the

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,149
girls in charges really all delivery

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,939
related services Anthony myself and what

00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:34,520
this has been able to have a thing and

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,620
large fees that they don't get back home

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,739
VPN project has been able to be involved

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,969
in both from open source and from a

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,280
commercial perspective which gives out

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:49,120
gives him a good vision of anything and

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,940
everything we can do with our solution

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,569
so first and foremost the agenda osb

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,559
p.m. and then use cases and then

00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:59,690
technical and business back the best

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,260
practices on how to envisage we pay

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,260
project

00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,200
what is business process management

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,140
business process management as if you

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,010
look a large number of exceptions and

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,840
census in our work going from business

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,890
analysis to business automatic

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,770
automation to a number of mixes of this

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,560
close to ESB sometimes very technical

00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:31,650
close to BPA sometimes very functional

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,650
and basically for us just make

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,580
I guess clear about what we will talk

00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,920
about for us the idea is to basically be

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,960
the link between two words between a

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,690
functional and between a technical work

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,030
to ensure that what is being sought out

00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,580
by the business is being implemented

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,460
according to technical best practices in

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,960
terms of business automation so means to

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,450
model automate measure and improve

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,320
processes that people use on a

00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,320
day-to-day basis

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:09,000
who we are we are a company now

00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,810
sponsoring and developing and nurturing

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,260
an open source project called panita so

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,380
company believe this up with 10,000

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,630
contributors between our community more

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,260
than a million download now and an

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:29,430
ecosystem last vocals and branches a

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,569
number of direction and are very various

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,569
projects so

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,790
so for us BPM base about being flexible

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,750
transparent affordable providing the

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,909
open source business model as well as a

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,280
very open architecture to be able to

00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,200
handle very technical projects and

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,519
initiatives for the modular architecture

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,640
and ensuring maximum because absolutely

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,540
operability is impossible but maximum

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,989
interoperability and making sure that

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,819
when we start a project we take into

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,790
account what exists from in a segment

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,980
from a sign perspective we have that job

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,609
during the break one of the breakouts

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,769
that is in real life you never start on

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:23,200
the ground shake regardless of what you

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,780
want to do in real life you start with a

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,420
number of constraints technical

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,400
constraints environment architecture

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,890
perspective and number of constraints

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,739
and I'm versus them in place and come in

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,459
and saying we're going to come with our

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,230
crew set of constraint and mr. project

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,030
leader mr. project team you're going to

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,120
have to adjust work and straighten

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,709
something something that

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,709
do so intero variability and ability to

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,080
merge the solution and the project we

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,769
have included into the project team in

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,120
the project constraint is compulsory

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,900
example I was good thing it would never

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,269
occur to anyone to go into a room and so

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,159
you can I don't like the color of the

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,250
walls and I don't like a color of your

00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,690
tables so I'm going to come my paintings

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,239
and change all of that before I start

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,820
working it would never occur to anyone

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,120
but it would appear to make people to

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:25,720
come in a project and say hey you're

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:28,520
using for example you're using tomcat I

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,850
don't like it I have a problem with some

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,039
of the stacks of this because I'm

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,970
running only on jboss so please mr.

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:40,100
project table Oh everybody change

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,169
everything you do do that from the start

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,789
because you have to abide by my

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,449
constraints but from a technical

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,999
perspective it could happen

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,259
it does happen very often right if I

00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:56,229
come out at all this month I see so

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,259
really from in addition to this when you

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,029
talk about BPM you talk about something

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,139
that is in the middle of many many many

00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:08,259
things if you look at the way where

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,999
we're looking and exposing our

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,189
architecture to the rest of the

00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:14,319
environment at the customer over the

00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:16,839
project or initiative were working on

00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,289
well you have a million ways of

00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:22,240
interacting at a median levels from a

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,249
business perspective from a technical

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,310
perspective from languish perspective

00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:31,550
from at any level

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,250
you put yourself at to look at the way

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,460
you should integrate or work there are

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:41,750
many different exposures in handling all

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,210
the physics is extremely complex if we

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,680
wanted to eat right ie we want to take

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,910
the constraints of the cut of the

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,150
customer and the constraints of the

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,430
project as the center as a key point of

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,230
the legal working so if you look at the

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,560
benitez architecture beneath the South

00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,320
architecture what we try to do is to

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,860
work on an architecture that is a

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,340
nutshell and that exposes the number of

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,320
services around in all directions so

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:15,560
that any project can find a way to

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,450
establish a dialogue with us if you just

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,440
look at the way we expose web services

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,900
today we are poor and we are meant to

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,630
have more because exposing the web

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,110
service isn't great having a variety of

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,150
ways to do it is even better in terms of

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,620
best practices from project now do they

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,010
get too much from the purpose of the

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,720
presentation in terms of the year the

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,640
best practices for project or food

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,640
learned is being able to communicate

00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,760
with an external application whatever

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,980
this is good being able to communicate

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,960
in the right way with an external

00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:56,669
application is a different story

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,550
you can define or decide that you can

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,500
work in with the rest api for example

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,580
what you're going to do if you do this

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,380
you're going to have to take into

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,229
account the performance here it does the

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,560
best way it is it the right way is there

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:14,009
another way to achieve the same value

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,389
from the same effect and am I on the

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,800
right level from the technical

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,000
perspective and I do and that's

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
something I'm going to come back to

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,389
later on but one of the key issues with

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,630
VPN project is defining at all levels at

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,030
all levels of detail what is strategic

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,240
what is important and what is accessory

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:40,410
what is it that you want to achieve in

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,159
real are we trying to talk to make two

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,470
databases communicate in real time is a

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,990
bad situation is etcetera etcetera

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,419
etcetera you can imagine you can carve

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,060
out many scenarios around this because

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,389
it is critical to define what skate &

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,389
Wesson

00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,880
sounds okay

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,070
so

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,810
so what we're trying to do from best

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,930
practice and from a different

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,860
perspective is to open up to many

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:21,420
different

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:24,570
variety of connectors in our system but

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:28,470
also to be able to enter a large variety

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,930
of different ecosystems so that we are

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,849
able to well this is more around

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,990
applications but you can also have the

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:39,360
equivalent around different technical

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,150
standards so that we're sure that we can

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,030
spend able as many options as possible

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:49,050
as any software in the word we have

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,990
limitations of this one but the idea the

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,550
challenge and day and the challenge

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,830
we're trying to undertake envelope in

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,790
time to take is to be as open as

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:04,010
possible to be able to give options that

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,010
are fit for any kind of and later

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:13,480
in terms of use cases BPM is useful in a

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,150
large variety of environments these are

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,790
business use cases but in terms of

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,100
objective we're talking about two

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,050
different things from a technical

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,690
perspective behind list if you're

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,520
looking at the helpdesk initiative you

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,860
will be around reducing response a

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,350
response site that is military time

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,140
military metales having real time

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,530
reporting it's a trained real-time

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,080
actionable information sales order

00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,150
management is around reducing the

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,890
processing capacity and therefore

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,940
reducing the risk associated to

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:51,730
contracts and to construct posing in

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,920
terms of a government we're looking at

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,670
reducing administration administrative

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,390
costs and ensuring better quality of

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,370
service for the citizen etc etc building

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,630
application around business process

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,440
management is something that

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,720
has so many varieties of working up with

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,280
the learning that we end up being in

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,890
completely different situations every

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,180
time and therefore what seems obvious

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,040
when we say around well making sure we

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,140
know what we want to do becomes

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,380
extremely difficult when we have

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,790
situations where people can talk come

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,440
talk you know because they don't want to

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,600
talk but console because they don't

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,600
speak the same language and because a

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,020
word a sentence doesn't have at all the

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:44,490
same meaning for one for the other yeah

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,850
i would like to integrate with basic

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,680
it's something big and that i would like

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,140
my application my process to be

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,090
integrated with a city somebody from

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,820
business saying this is saying i would

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,790
like to get data from there somebody

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,530
from architecture would start thinking

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,350
integration between two systems one

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,540
being extremely complex and difficult to

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,300
handle as well as proprietary have many

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,950
managers from architectural perspective

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,440
the DBA will stop looking and saying oh

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,110
from a response time that's a that's a

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,450
time what information do I need etcetera

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,450
etcetera and I can keep on talking etc

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:25,530
where the only thing that was requested

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,180
initially what I would like to put

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,700
together the start date for my employee

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,420
because it is the entry point of my

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,970
business process

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,190
yes a mineral having pizza is a real

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,910
life challenge on a day to day basis on

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,010
a minute to minute basis so something by

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:47,890
making sure that people can talk to each

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:51,800
other is one of the biggest and most

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:56,060
complicated challenge in BPM

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,399
in that explains the fact that we as the

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,310
desert hot designed to quit on top of

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,730
the engine that is the debate of the

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,130
court resolution to put a design concern

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,100
and the purpose of the design control it

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,880
is to get people talking at the level to

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,010
which they need to go

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,510
looks like this it's a few interface

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:25,690
that's extremely easy to work on and

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:30,580
we're functional people can start adding

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:32,980
value validating content validating the

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,910
process and say what I need there is

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:40,510
this they came right there they can have

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,570
they can get use to it so that later

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,910
therefore once we have a design at least

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,490
the first version of the design we can

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,460
take it from there and from a process

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,280
development perspective define what is

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,430
needed and how to do things that we need

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,140
to do one of the key best practices that

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,110
we've learned from the product we've

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,510
been able to be involving involved in it

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,760
that sometimes some people don't really

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,350
some people didn't really mind on

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,510
whether we go one direction or another

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:16,840
in terms of process if that is some step

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,550
here or there could mean the difference

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,310
between this and that could be really

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:25,810
nothing from a business perspective that

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:28,470
is SD is the way we get this information

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,810
like this like that in real time

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,300
from a business perspective can make no

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,940
difference however from an architectural

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,700
perspective it can be 10 because it can

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,070
have impacts completely different so

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,470
what would be in terms of best practices

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,070
they go to learn is that making

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:49,350
iteration in making architecture impact

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,410
studies as well as development impact

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,500
studies before start developing saying

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,390
going in that direction will take that

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,680
time going in this direction will take

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:04,140
this time do you really need it is it

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,640
really that easy to really mandatory for

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,080
what you try to reach people is

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,440
something that we would be done in terms

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,600
of group consequence constantly because

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,220
then if you want we had a great

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,790
presentation earlier about the belief

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,250
project if you look at I would like my

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,750
platform to be performing and have a

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,830
reported on this doesn't mean tremendous

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,320
amount of different things from

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,600
different people however at the end of

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,780
the day performance has to be in it

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,920
because they're in Sicily to begin

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:40,070
by orange juicer by any you know any

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,670
company or entity having a strategy

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,670
