Abstract:
Business Process Management (BPM) is the discipline focused on optimizing the efficiency of a business. Although Business Process Management implementation has many immediate and long-term benefits, a poor start can jeopardize the overall success of the mission.

so in terms of what you're looking to do

00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,440
here in terms of best practices design

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,310
connect to the rest of the IT system we

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,220
rent and then evidently not at the same

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,110
level of the one we were in the

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,560
presentation before we're trying to

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,440
monitor and due process administration

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,600
to ensure that whatever what's actually

00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,530
happening and that's happening to her

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,530
life the way she

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,920
in terms of best practices again

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,670
generally when we start we start from

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,670
ideas like this

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,830
we'd like to find a software to automate

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,330
all the treatment of hospitals why well

00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:01,610
because too many people are involved

00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:03,920
because people are so many rushed so

00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,500
much rest sorry during the day of work

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,570
that sometimes they're missing something

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,750
and you can have life in fact in fact

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,780
some people so ultimately organizing

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,090
standardizing the processes of anything

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,400
including including blog diet including

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,310
food delivery etc starts like this the

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,310
project parameters of projects are like

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,720
this with the general information then

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,040
it comes drill down into i would like to

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,990
interpret vote will need the information

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
from here here and there so i would like

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,030
to integrate with these days and down an

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,830
i bet that'd be fighting each person

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,110
reforming the tour of the room and ask

00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,100
what what are you thinking when you read

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:49,009
only this i will get one two three four

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,610
five six seven eight nine different

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:56,120
answers because each of you go figure

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:59,040
this out from the perspective of you

00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,790
know where they come from

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,550
it is called us how quickest and how

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,980
even what is the most security way in

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,470
terms of efficiency and perform it way

00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,680
to achieve what we need to achieve so

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,520
we're kind of I would say that in terms

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,340
of the NICUs of best practices reversing

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,380
your fencing we're looking at ourselves

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,940
as a business with where or business

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,660
that we call me to wear to ensure that

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,010
people can communicate and get access to

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,010
the right information in the right time

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,480
now this requires focus another best

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,560
practice is about each person has each

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,280
own set of skills and even if it's some

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,780
simple I can't model if it's even if it

00:02:48,280 --> 00:03:00,270
is complicated I can't develop all the

00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:03,940
execution required for the the the ideas

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,030
get having people focus on each part of

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,480
the project according to their skill set

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,570
and according to the impact associated

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,580
we all we open always focused on the

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,080
technical impacts because it is critical

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,060
to the success of the project because

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,120
you know you turn on the platform you

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,700
know it's working or not working but it

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,520
is also important to consider does it do

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,220
what it needs to do and is it going to

00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,980
be onboarding by people who are working

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,310
on it so that it corresponds to what

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,310
they needed

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,160
other risks that we see very very often

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,310
is lying circle and circling until we

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:51,680
try and kill the process that is one of

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,300
the you sometimes most common outcome of

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,290
a BPM project south hours obviously

00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,890
because they're geniuses that in general

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,280
but the idea is really to the more going

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:09,609
in circles and to keep reasonable

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,140
expectations at me when you translate

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,569
business takes sometimes it goes I'd

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,400
like to connect said 77 different

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,989
systems in the critical in a critical

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,699
process in real time and start exposing

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:27,139
and over 2,000 web services at the same

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:29,930
time yes mr. customer why not it will be

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,880
a great 10 years in later but it's not

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,770
first of all so setting expectations

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,090
right and assessing the risk associated

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,550
with a available to be accessibility if

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,130
you have you know completely secured

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,310
system but it is so secure that when you

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,560
want to call and it VI your job right

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,320
sideline to access it well too bad it's

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,080
Africa

00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:01,740
such right center

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:04,990
using prototyping that is validating

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,150
different architectures different

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,500
options before defining was the right

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,169
one what's the most efficient part and

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,770
ensuring that we can make kind of a

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:22,919
drive test or with a non critical

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,919
process first so that's a different

00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:32,239
and then use faith deployment to ensure

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:35,089
that we get where we need to go getting

00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:37,569
onboarding from everyone on the project

00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:43,569
team and

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:46,360
and last but not least apply metrics to

00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:52,059
ensure that all the metrics are right or

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:54,639
what we need Fuji I'll write for delay

00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:56,789
before we need to achieve and ensure

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,830
that both from a performance from

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,059
reliability from an adult ability as

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:06,139
well as from an efficiency perspective

00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:09,189
all metrics are there to ensure success

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,189
