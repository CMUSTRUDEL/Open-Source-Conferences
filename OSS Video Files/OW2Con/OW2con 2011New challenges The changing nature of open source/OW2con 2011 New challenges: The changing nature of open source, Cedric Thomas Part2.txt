	Speakers: Cedric Thomas, OW2
Abstract: In 2010 open source became a driver for software innovation. After ten years catching up with proprietary software in commoditized enterprise computing product categories, open source has taken the lead in cloud computing innovation. The live demonstration, by two OW2 members, of a broker interacting with heterogenous cloud computing infrastructures is one of those defining moments by which whole industries measure their progress.
