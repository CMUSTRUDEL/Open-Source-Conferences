Description: 
	Speakers: Cedric Thomas, OW2
Abstract: In 2010 open source became a driver for software innovation. After ten years catching up with proprietary software in commoditized enterprise computing product categories, open source has taken the lead in cloud computing innovation. The live demonstration, by two OW2 members, of a broker interacting with heterogenous cloud computing infrastructures is one of those defining moments by which whole industries measure their progress.

so it is a profit was Reggie why because

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,530
first of all it's not only about money

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,320
this is a quote I got last month from

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,510
the shanghai stock exchange it's a

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
second largest in the world and what

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,380
they say is we cannot take the risk of

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,510
proprietary software anymore we cannot

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,490
get the right and quick response except

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,340
we play both much more money yes we do

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,730
have money we do it meant they have

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,739
money in surveys shanghai stock exchange

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:40,290
but we can more control this is a very

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,450
mature attitude it's not just about

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,789
short-term budget it's about midterm and

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,510
long-term control and decided by

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,449
themselves and in an industry that is

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,190
totally dominated by the North American

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,910
industry and in the software industry is

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,460
like that if the other countries in some

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,339
of the large and like public services

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,640
large companies want to decide by

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,180
themselves open source is a solution and

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,220
now the billion-dollar question I've got

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,000
right in very small but how do you make

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,630
money with free software here while you

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,600
remember that site i showed you earlier

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:28,320
not that much so first of all the value

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,689
is made where it's made of the code I'm

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,770
not denying that but it's make someone

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,619
else so let me show you a generate

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,820
business model for software vendor and I

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:45,560
think you like that i would say yourself

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,880
you can make money on the product some

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,490
but you would make money on the service

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,820
and you can also make money selling

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,820
insurance

00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,310
that is the real business model for

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,880
software vendor in an opportunist

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,820
context the product is only part of the

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,979
story but then when you look at the

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,950
balance sheet of muscle / vendors you

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,680
realize that they do a lot of money on

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,220
service so in a way it's not that new

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,100
and it works look at Red Hat's pension

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,830
it is valid so Reynolds form 10-k and

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:30,819
they do something like the net income on

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:32,290
a total revenue of six 678 you will get

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,670
out this is a pretty good business

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,709
margin so if you really want to develop

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,030
a business follow you go and look at

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:45,250
what's public from some of the details

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,370
and it works so narrow what are the new

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,959
challenges for us and this is what we're

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,420
looking at for a fraud in YouTube

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,830
because we're we know that we've been

00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:00,340
developing on the window with many a

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,140
project in a disruption on the

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,709
disruption mode but now we know to

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:09,459
between the innovate first of all one

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,560
challenge is to actually leverage real

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,180
business ecosystems a business is

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,410
consistent just not a word that is used

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,350
like that it's something that has

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,440
mechanisms rules that what in a certain

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:23,109
way and that is radically different from

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,690
the traditional value chain that we can

00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:29,200
find some industries value chains are

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,570
defined by buyer-seller relationship but

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,030
the power relationship you can have

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,859
between the buyer and the seller at the

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,489
best price you can get and the more you

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:42,640
get to the end user the more you get you

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,110
wanted to enjoy I'm going to figure 8

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,980
this is the 18

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,990
venue grows up now in an ecosystem you

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,000
don't have that kind of vision you want

00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,790
to do that but you also have another

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,620
vision which is what circulator well you

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,710
realize that was good before this

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,900
neighbor when it could be good for the

00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,300
neighbors see and we'll it'll be really

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,220
good for you at some point you'll enter

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,090
into context and that's what you want to

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,630
have I mean the famous business

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:18,080
ecosystem we know is this weekend rally

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:22,700
but you can think of the watch Valley in

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,950
Switzerland where the watch

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,850
manufacturers they've invested in

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,980
developing college special trainings

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,230
that seems to be money I mean they don't

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,360
making money by just paying for

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,100
trainings no tomorrow they will get the

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,380
right the right type of confidence as

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,840
the right of people working for them

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,250
that face of this is persisting and

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,540
since we're in France I could have

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,120
mentioned the kind of business ecosystem

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,160
you find in the wine countries one

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,230
regions or you have everything you see

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,440
the rise but you have the other

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,870
companies that can provide the bottles

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,420
the those that provide their crates the

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,250
print shops that provide the labels the

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,590
lawyers don't know how to defend them

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,980
the captain's the trailers and either

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:11,360
the brokers everything is there and the

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,010
college's it's something where it's not

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,440
just a value chain what I by himself

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,090
this is very short term very narrow it's

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,400
a context and this is what we're trying

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,610
to do with other people we try to create

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,060
a context second challenge is to

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,250
actually leverage our sweet spot I think

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,980
that where the risk of some ownership

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,050
weather is valued brought directly to

00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,780
the customer by the understand the

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,900
specific understanding of the specific

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,410
conditions of one of the customer that

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,550
can that can be done on the property

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,980
it's a business solution that you're

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,370
delivering Roxy simply dividing into

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,919
that

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,020
it's very specific customer specific

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:57,380
that can be prepared on the other hand

00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:01,250
where you're talking about a technology

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,680
that can be used by two banks because

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,800
that does not bring the dif different

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,190
session not make exactly at that level

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,680
that should be done on an open source

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,720
way this is what you bet you get to get

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,090
your best leverage and that's what we're

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,240
trying to do this is why we positioning

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:26,060
whatever you do on the infrastructure so

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:29,360
as I assure this side is money we've

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,660
been following closely following proper

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,669
three vendors something happens in 2010

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,039
that turns and that took many people by

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,960
surprise we didn't know for a while

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,460
whether it was just marketing further or

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,410
we have to analyze whether it was

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,080
actually changing things and start

00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,110
computing apparently cloud computing is

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,919
the form that something very old is

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,940
taking place we need to talk about

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,669
utility computing I could way back but

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,310
now we are trying to we're actually

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:05,210
executing on this vision and the way we

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:09,010
exhibit in this vision is cocktail

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:12,320
computing out and in cloud computing

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,870
proprietary vendors don't have their

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,300
photo already provided very vendors

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,240
don't have a delete and we actually

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,740
mostly racing with them open source is

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,870
actually develop a tumorous technologies

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,289
this is a change and we this is a real

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,030
role there so from the other be to state

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,270
bonds we think that there is going to be

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,780
or good crowd for getting that or

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:41,120
caltopia requires some innovations that

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:46,340
there will be no content with our open

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,700
source software so we positioning w2 by

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,410
delivering open source for contracts

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,290
of course it's covering me this is very

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:58,190
simplistic this way but this is our this

00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,750
is our direction so there but there are

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,290
all the opportunities that were looking

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:06,380
at in areas where open source can be

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,960
developed developing in industry not

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,580
sure I mentioned that in the security or

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,400
bedded software some companies were

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,230
already sharing but we hear that we hear

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,480
that the autumn in the interpretive

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,950
industry they're already thinking about

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,630
sharing the developments because they

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,720
know that we have to maintain this for

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:29,170
the last next 20 years and this is a

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,180
burden that does not bring value to them

00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:35,360
so this is an area in the industry an

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,600
ambulance the motorized rmd and support

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,830
in government where economies of scale

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,800
or and budgets constraints are play a

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,320
big role open source is probably natural

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,500
player and then we've already identified

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,300
another area which is that of future

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,250
internet the Internet of Things or

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,110
machine to machine etc and that's

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,690
another area where we think that open

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,610
source as but there may be other areas

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,290
and installation of opportunities of

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,860
course we don't know exactly where so

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,720
that's the vision the situation what we

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,030
have in our the back for minor to do

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,700
YouTube and this is what we think we are

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:17,560
the great position great opportunities

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,560
