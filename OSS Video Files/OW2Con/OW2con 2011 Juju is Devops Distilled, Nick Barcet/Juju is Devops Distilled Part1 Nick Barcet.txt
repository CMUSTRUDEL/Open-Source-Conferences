Description: 
	Speaker:  Nicolas Barcet, Canonical
Abstract: Formerly called Ensemble, Juju is DevOps Distilled. Through the use of charms (renamed from formulas), juju provides shareable, re-usable, and repeatable expressions of DevOps best practices. Juju charms can be used unmodified, or easily changed and connected to fit your needs. Juju provides service orchestration. Juju focuses on managing the service units one need to deliver a single solution, above simply configuring the machines or cloud instances needed to run them. Charms developed, tested, and deployed on local hardware will operate the same in an EC2 API compatible cloud (which includes, of course, OpenStack). There's no need to learn a domain specific language (DSL) to use juju or create charms.
The presentation will deliver an introduction to Juju, using Hadoop as an exemple worload to deploy, and will open to discussions on how itcould be used by OW2 projects.
