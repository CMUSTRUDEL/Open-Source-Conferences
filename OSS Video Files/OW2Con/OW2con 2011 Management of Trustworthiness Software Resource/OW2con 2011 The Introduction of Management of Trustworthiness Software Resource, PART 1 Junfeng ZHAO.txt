Abstract: To manage trustworthiness software resource is important for trust software development. We will introduce a method to evaluate the trustworthiness of software resource, such as Java API and Web service. Then, we will give an instance that has been realized in the software resource library, named as TSR (Trustie Software Resource Repository). TSR can be used as a component managing tool which provides mechanism to describe, collect, evaluate, classify and manage software resources' trustworthiness, to support trust software development. The TSR has been published on OW2 on July, 2010.
