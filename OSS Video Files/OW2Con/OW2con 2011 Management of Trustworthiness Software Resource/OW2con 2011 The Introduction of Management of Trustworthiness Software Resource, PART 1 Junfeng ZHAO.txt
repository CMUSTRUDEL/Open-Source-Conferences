Title: OW2con 2011 The Introduction of Management of Trustworthiness Software Resource, PART 1 Junfeng ZHAO
Publication date: 2012-01-09
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Management of Trustworthiness Software Resource
Description: 
	Speaker: Junfeng ZHAO, Pekin University
Abstract: To manage trustworthiness software resource is important for trust software development. We will introduce a method to evaluate the trustworthiness of software resource, such as Java API and Web service. Then, we will give an instance that has been realized in the software resource library, named as TSR (Trustie Software Resource Repository). TSR can be used as a component managing tool which provides mechanism to describe, collect, evaluate, classify and manage software resources' trustworthiness, to support trust software development. The TSR has been published on OW2 on July, 2010.

	00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:12,690
now our introduced the management

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:15,420
software resources as we know from now

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,300
on we now to develop our software from

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,520
fresh so we need to find some proper

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,000
code of some proper component right

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,660
Internet to build our own system but how

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,320
can we approve that should the code when

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,840
you reuse them is the trusting in Africa

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,899
and drop them enough damage our existing

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,059
so cultural management the past

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,239
worsening of software resources it's

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,559
very important that we develop a system

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,829
to manage to such things look here is

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,140
the contents of our presentation at

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,289
first I will ensure give a brief

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,739
introduction to the timer status of the

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,350
GSR that means trusted searched

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,559
receivers software with resource

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,040
repository and I have introduced the H

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,610
last year so this part I only give a

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,409
brief introduction and the second part

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,140
of age of trust words nice resource

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,799
management management sure and this is

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,900
what I focus turn to introduce that

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,049
special means that average deals the

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,689
matter the models that we use to manage

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,930
the traffic versus the resources and

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,869
then I will introduce i think is a very

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,070
convenient concern we have just

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,409
developed for web services research we

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,399
all know that Jim advil cloud computing

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,220
and your SOA based systems we should

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,040
always sometimes the way we want to find

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,189
some services over the internet but how

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,310
can we find the services that are proper

00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:01,439
for us to build our system so we also

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:04,130
developed tools to help us to search the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,910
proper services so that's

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:14,190
contents as for the motivation a full

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:17,430
hour I want to develop the PSR is that

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,300
we all know one moment mr. development

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,870
and applications I need to trust versus

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,240
resources so how to enhance software

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,500
ecology and how to improve suffer

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:36,090
reduces that is ours our intention and

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:41,700
Chester and I sinkers better we want

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:44,070
eatontown 2005 and he has his visa data

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,950
Chester is a leaf that's the children

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,680
has in trustee willingness and a

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,320
capability to deliver a quality of

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,830
service in a given context and in a

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,010
given talents Tammy option and the chest

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,280
to software resource repositories is to

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,610
provide mechanisms to describe collector

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,820
in value H classified and the manager

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,010
software resources as witness to support

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,510
your chest Recep 12 divided of materials

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:19,080
and hearing the pre workout yes are we

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,390
can see we have three layers and the

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,120
bottom layer miss Thatcher we were

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,310
searched some code and services from

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,350
internet all there are some companies

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,470
that are they were publish the account

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:35,160
and service services in our system and

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,370
the second layer is the function layers

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,580
that you will induce sub no resources at

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,220
raster evaluation and also to the such

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,640
angel of the software resources and the

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,540
interface layer is how to access our

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,019
system we can buy web browser or by EPA

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,860
and also we give the web services API

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,350
that some systems can integrated our

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:06,030
system together that's the framework of

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:11,280
our TS arm and now we have upload our

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,470
system 20 w 2 and the evo with a turn

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,580
the address above you can see our

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,670
project

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,489
and from these returns these research

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:24,480
projects at is the 707 well that

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:28,200
included the sauce some code of that

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,810
application and a comparable for Jonas

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,110
that is the source code of ejbs which

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,430
are in charge of basic business logic

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,550
implementation and data persistence and

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,750
a third is the enterprise application

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,320
project for a place these three parts

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,550
that we are now on the third base and

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,910
the other things that we are doing now

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,830
is that we were installed OTS are in

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,940
order to endure this work is the

00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:01,670
unworkable and revenge open our DSR I'm

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:08,010
December and here is a homepage and

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:11,880
alternate approach and this is the SVM

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,880
screenshot and as for the project in

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,040
China I will give a brief introduction

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,810
from China you can make it a surprise

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,720
about and now there is our total

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,370
resources and our vegetable users we

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,310
have deployed our systems our celery

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,560
celery software parts and also we have

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,020
some companies that have has has

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,669
installed our systems to support their

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:45,450
development such as a digital China and

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:51,600
Noah and unwed add a software the

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:57,330
software company and from we can see

00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:02,580
they know our our website of our system

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:05,310
and this is the trustee level of our

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,610
resources that means the database from 0

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,550
to 5 5 is the perfect one and we don't

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,660
think that resources on the internet or

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:18,960
in our system can be reached a file so

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,590
we can see Oh a lot of are the second

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,290
and the third one and we will give them

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,560
why they are on the second level already

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:32,190
answer level and the users Monday use

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,580
this software resources they can make a

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,330
just judge how can they use these

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,920
resources and they will see the proofs

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,920
