Title: OW2con 2011 The Introduction of Management of Trustworthiness Software Resource, PART 2 Junfeng ZHAO
Publication date: 2012-01-09
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Management of Trustworthiness Software Resource
Description: 
	Speaker: Junfeng ZHAO, Pekin University
Abstract: To manage trustworthiness software resource is important for trust software development. We will introduce a method to evaluate the trustworthiness of software resource, such as Java API and Web service. Then, we will give an instance that has been realized in the software resource library, named as TSR (Trustie Software Resource Repository). TSR can be used as a component managing tool which provides mechanism to describe, collect, evaluate, classify and manage software resources' trustworthiness, to support trust software development. The TSR has been published on OW2 on July, 2010.

I'm here is the album as the worst

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,529
resource management of framework here

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,460
here are a full parts of our CC the

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,150
force is the evidence model evidence

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,250
mother is very important because the

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,560
later works that'll help can be judge

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,929
their software sorted password is based

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,140
on the evidence model so the Aptus

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,829
multi-term is what is needed collection

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,320
and to analyze the evidence and here is

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,680
them our absence models with the scene

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,789
ominous relationship why because we have

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,559
seen better our different scenarios

00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,570
submercer people we are given that was

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,210
the average lot of eight and some people

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,309
on cable evidence model p but the

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,270
evidence model a tan mala p they were

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,960
collapsed so in order to give a

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,080
comprehensive judgment of our resources

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,799
we will use these two models of three

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,540
bottles and models and we were we were

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,390
if something's who have the

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,479
characteristics to in monterey have some

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,060
tea numbers as the calculor stick one in

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,490
endless knot avi and we will get a

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,500
relationship work and in that case that

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,390
should we can have more evidence and

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,900
more average I've evidence from from the

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,810
promise this model and the second part

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,180
is the evidence-gathering model and this

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,310
one that we collect an estas various

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,729
cancer for absence for trust the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,579
worsening software and evaluation that

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,820
means the way we connect objective

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,180
evidence that means that from the people

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,119
who gave to give some to give some

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,340
Rebirth keep some feedbacks they will

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,649
say all the this component is very easy

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,350
to use though this component is horrible

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,920
I calculation that is objective

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:11,330
feedbacks and object to address

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,030
second that is the subjective evidence

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,069
and the days seven days objects to

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,709
evidence that means that we were

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,980
collected tester results of the

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:25,130
component of the services and we also we

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,680
have a monitor that came up can monitor

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,489
the service and running us into natural

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,760
we access these services them every four

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:36,860
times a day so we can we can know how

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,269
about the service that it serves can be

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,459
worked on internet so data comprises our

00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,680
absence the gathering model and the

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,760
third is the average person is the

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,319
management model that will just waste

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,340
anticipation that the collected evidence

00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,680
is false of inaccurate sometimes the

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,940
evidence informed are inaccurate we

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,940
should clean this evidence and a certain

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,340
and that is a transverse nice evaluation

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,819
and the classification and we have a

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:14,000
common standard in our systems that we

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:18,049
divided our result resources into four

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,380
into six lands at from zero to five but

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:24,350
you owe me on retainer with some

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,010
companies such as the visual chana and

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,100
they have different they have different

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:34,790
views of how to classify certain

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,150
resources because the our system we are

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:41,780
faced the ordinary questioner as

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:45,739
digitana they are water allowed in the

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,230
text management domain so from their job

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,329
from the view they think that should

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:55,370
they should divide the server resources

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:58,609
just to four levels so we can also will

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,430
change the the evaluation rules and also

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,950
the witching just specification for how

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,829
to derive the summer resources so they

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,890
can use in their company so that is

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,350
chester was

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,740
asian classification that's use the

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,049
gathered evidence and the user-defined

00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,209
expectation model to evaluate the

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,770
trustworthiness of software resources

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,870
and this is the framework as I have

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,300
mentioned about me and this is the

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,730
implementation framework of our trusty

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,490
overseas which lost many men convention

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,650
and we can see from the tears are we

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,660
have a sovereign resourceful Easter and

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,460
that should we should ascend to an

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,490
information collection for software

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,250
resources and then they they were

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,380
triggered the athletic lecture that they

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,260
were collecting evidence from the

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,310
evidence model and then they were strong

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,530
efforts model and they were used they

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,500
were used the new rules and the

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,350
regulations that defined in the heaven

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,620
in valuation model to give each

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,890
resources water was her trusty levels

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,810
that the abalone and this is our

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:16,500
implementation framework and as we know

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,000
2222 reuses up some resources so

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,870
something is very important as a little

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,300
have a lot of resources if we just the

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,700
elite defender that's the user's

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,210
published their own resources into the

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,450
system that is not enough so in that

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:37,260
case we develop such ancient from this

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,050
danger we could search some java api's

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,500
all services from internet and stop

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,040
their information in our systems that

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,330
could help our system to be more rich in

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:54,630
resources so we develop develop the

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,919
search engine folders transverse nice

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,200
the resources and we can we develop some

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,200
color to crawl the web services on the

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,370
java if he has and then we will clean up

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,949
this data

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,880
and no stop them in the database after

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,860
that we will organize the recognizable

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,490
information and then we also collect the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,340
feedback of these resources after that

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,070
over who this stage were sitting out

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:27,180
here sir and then when somebody is

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,360
asking for something they were used the

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,300
retrieval supporter and the result to

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,570
rank mechanism was according to the

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,229
requirements of the users and then we

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,229
will give him the proper results and

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:48,630
that is our framework of the search in

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:51,570
danger and now here it's a screen a

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,690
screenshot of our life services room and

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,449
from this you can see this web services

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,600
that is a level three chasa level is a

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,000
level three and this is the response

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,380
time of the services because we have

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,900
developed a monitor so from it thing we

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,900
were access these services the four

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,270
times a day and from that's the data we

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,440
can calculate the average response time

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:22,830
and also the availability of the

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,310
services and also we have a collected

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,260
the feedback of the users and from this

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,620
we can see these are the feedback of

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,160
users they will give some some points of

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,970
how bad of how good in the services and

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,520
from all this evidence way our system

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,430
check that this service is a level three

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,099
so when people as such for some web

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,720
services they can see all is well L

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,690
Street perhaps they took proper for me

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,050
to use oh isn't to know i can use nature

00:07:51,690 --> 00:08:00,870
so i can help people to select proper

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:03,870
services and from from the work previous

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,530
we also from some problems that should

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,680
along as well web service for example we

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,780
with found we found actually the

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,090
descriptions of the web service is

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,670
let me teaser that means that if you're

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,610
just want to get some information from

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:24,540
wisco our web services that is not

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:28,530
enough for people to realize this the

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,230
functions of the web services so we also

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,140
developed a bus services such angel not

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:37,919
called a comprehensive web services such

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,440
engine that means as a min time we were

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,820
in which the web service descriptions

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,690
and also we were in which the current

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,200
information of this racism and then we

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,780
were give a user from healthy view of

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,750
how these web services and how can we

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:02,670
use and this is all the framework of our

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,850
work cause and as for them as for the

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:11,520
speed of the internet I think it's very

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:14,490
slow so i just opened some some a

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,990
picture of the co web services you can

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:23,280
with you I'll go to this address is the

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:26,820
what Co web service Stockholm and from

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,330
this you can just included hewers of the

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,810
service value want to fund and then we

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:37,260
will give you the research results from

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,930
the rhombus columns that is the the

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,650
tools that is not use our ways you can

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,740
see the and the information is not sure

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:50,760
Richie natural and from this column is

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:54,120
used our our method we have english of

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,640
the web service descriptions also we

00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,330
give this the services quality of

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,850
service if you choose I or see the

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,190
details of this web services and then a

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,960
page was opened will give the

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,560
descriptions and also the text as a

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,770
collaborative

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:19,690
service the info also the feedbacks you

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:23,080
can see someone has said of the service

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:29,170
would be great if it worked something

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:32,500
like this and as follow kills you can

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:36,490
see the details of the kills battlin

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,000
this service I think it doesn't work

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,730
what will I want to show another example

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,490
Sebastian I will turn the internet for

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,860
10 minutes and it happen to return to

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,520
the results so if you are interested in

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,120
these choose you can visit her the call

00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:00,930
web services and that's the our tools

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,930
