Description: 
	Speaker: Dianxi SHI, NUDT
Abstract: Context Manage Framework(CMF) is a framework which run on mobile devices and cloud. The part of CMF which run on mobile device could fetch the context around mobile device, and send the context to cloud. According to the large-scale context which received from many mobile devices, the part of CMF which run on cloud could use all of the context to aggregate. The result of the context aggregation is used to provide better service for users.
CMF is divided into two parts. The part which run on mobile device is developed on Android, it can be used to collect the context around phones automatically. It could collect the information from eight sensors in Android operating system, CPU information and so on. Subscription of context and different frequency of context collecting are provided. The part which run on cloud is developed on Hadoop, it can be used to receive context from large-scale phones, and it also can be used to aggregate the context. The algorithm of context aggregation based on rule is implemented by MapReduce Model. And the result of context aggregation is provided for users by webservices. The feature of CMF are aggregating large-scale context, providing better services for users.

okay hello everyone I'm from school

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,850
computer awful needing the University of

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,270
Defense technology our computer school

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:26,660
is a is the biggest school in the world

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:32,369
and our school has produced the femurs a

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:38,100
supercomputer which name etl till hide

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:41,550
wind the number one in the last year in

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,360
the world today I want talk about our

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,469
work context situation really see in

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,489
mobile cloud computing first let's look

00:00:49,469 --> 00:01:00,260
at the background of our work d table

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:05,189
should total technology trends in the

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,130
terms of a gardener this year's the most

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,010
important technology is a cloud

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,700
computing and mobile application and the

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,840
media tablet today's many speakers focus

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:24,210
on the crowd beauty from this week I see

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:32,040
the forecast had become reality am our

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:35,790
focus on our in tricity aid what

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,600
happened to windy wind is to technology

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:43,649
come companies integrator and their

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,829
wheezing the result of this digital

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,759
technology companies is a mobile cloud

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,450
computing this is because the quickly

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,509
development of the mobile internet more

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,189
and more closer series that I image

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:06,180
mobile service according to the EPA

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:10,649
research in the near future the mobile

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,470
cloud computing market will be fine

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,000
point to Billings every

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:23,670
year another research show which will be

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,920
the 9.5 pds every year so we think this

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,920
is very important the computing paradigm

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,510
what is the cloud community this picture

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,550
shows are we pro we propose the

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:42,020
architecture of the mobile cloud

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:45,120
computing we sync mobile cloud commuting

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:50,760
consists of several parts the first part

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:55,020
is the mobile device the function of

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,920
these mobile devices act as a bootable

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:03,840
of computing world and the next party

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:07,920
the wireless network and internet and

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,950
this function is to connect everything's

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,459
in together and that the last part is

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:19,200
the cloud cloud computing platform or

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:26,940
service this this part provides service

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:30,630
to the user and the beside the function

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,320
of the mobile device to assess the cloud

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,730
computing service and another function

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,790
is to provide since since information to

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:48,230
the cloud I think this is a very

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:52,430
important the theater because country

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:59,310
mobile device you already equipped with

00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:03,420
with a rich sensors such as GPS compass

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,470
and the light scissors and so are a lot

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,590
of context real play kissy have been

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:12,989
developed such as a smart room single

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,910
user behaviors in singh group user

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:22,650
behavior CC and the sewer currently many

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,620
research how to do some how to do that

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,360
my work to do with the last secure

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,740
contest there

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,470
such as the pure project so the goal of

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:39,100
this project is to collect the

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,800
temperature humidity GPS location for

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,410
multiple phones to detect the

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,900
environment equal quality of the city

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:52,120
and another work is a we tricked the

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,770
malfunction of the projected to correct

00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:03,700
the GPS location of settle for device to

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:08,050
Decatur traffic stage we think contains

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:12,360
utility or any awareness included age is

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:15,669
very very important contact sack right

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,100
by thousand twelve all mobile device

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:26,350
until continued World War II for

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:30,130
missions but but how to collect larger

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:33,750
context and aggregated this information

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:38,860
is a very difficult tasks so we think

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:41,650
wimp we face many challenges this is a

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,800
because there is no efficient and

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,130
reusable middle ear to support a

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,220
contested collection and synthesis in

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,400
mobile cloud computing environment in

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:59,640
order to beauty of adoria we must deal

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:03,910
with many problem such as math skills

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:08,290
information and hit virginity such as

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:12,630
both associated device and contacted

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:18,610
this is these are heterogeneous and

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:22,930
another problem is a mobile device has

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:27,870
how many hits how many characters such

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:32,880
as a limited resource and the network is

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:38,050
instability and the dynamic environment

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,760
so piss on this research and we start

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,810
our work

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:50,280
powered easy to build context the

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:55,170
management of rework this framework run

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:58,020
on mobility voice and cloud the man the

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:03,230
main goal of this project is to in the

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:09,090
pool article contains a lecture and the

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:12,570
aggregation under this framework divided

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:16,620
into two parts the first part is a run

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,230
on the mobile device and the dis part

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,260
the function of these parties collected

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,780
context around the mobile device and the

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,760
synthes the context information to the

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:34,460
cloud and then another party is a under

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:37,350
we are on the cloud and cloud side and

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,110
the function of these parties will

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:43,500
receive the contact information from the

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,220
sultans of a more powerful and handled

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:51,020
handled days of information and

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:57,950
aggregate and gave the results to the

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:57,950
mobile device and the picture shows a

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:09,510
architecture of the framework you can

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,010
see the first part is a mobile phone in

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,080
this free work there are many mobile

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:20,880
phone and the mobile phone collector

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,730
contact sir and from the from the device

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,350
or environment and the cindy anderson

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,350
