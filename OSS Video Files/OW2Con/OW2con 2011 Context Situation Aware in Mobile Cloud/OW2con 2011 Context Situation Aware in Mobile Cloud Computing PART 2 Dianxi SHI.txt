Abstract: Context Manage Framework(CMF) is a framework which run on mobile devices and cloud. The part of CMF which run on mobile device could fetch the context around mobile device, and send the context to cloud. According to the large-scale context which received from many mobile devices, the part of CMF which run on cloud could use all of the context to aggregate. The result of the context aggregation is used to provide better service for users.
CMF is divided into two parts. The part which run on mobile device is developed on Android, it can be used to collect the context around phones automatically. It could collect the information from eight sensors in Android operating system, CPU information and so on. Subscription of context and different frequency of context collecting are provided. The part which run on cloud is developed on Hadoop, it can be used to receive context from large-scale phones, and it also can be used to aggregate the context. The algorithm of context aggregation based on rule is implemented by MapReduce Model. And the result of context aggregation is provided for users by webservices. The feature of CMF are aggregating large-scale context, providing better services for users.
