Abstract: The CLIF Load Injection Framework project was launched in year 2003 by Orange Labs (France Telecom R&D) and INRIA, in the ObjectWeb /OW2 community. Since then, Orange Labs have been leading this project, bringing  many code contributions. Why? As an integrated telco, Orange has to handle and interconnect a great variety of Information and Networking technologies, with high stakes in terms of service availability and quality of service. Testing in general, and more particularly performance testing, has become a major challenge for Orange. Among the tens of real CLIF use cases at Orange, we focus on the WSOI test case, the web-service oriented infrastructure that runs over 500 web services consumers and providers, and handles about half a billion calls per month for the Orange Group.
