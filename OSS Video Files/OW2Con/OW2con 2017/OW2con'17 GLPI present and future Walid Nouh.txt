00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,519
hello everybody I'm going to talk about

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,650
the GI project I just a quick question

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:21,779
who knows who have already heard about

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:31,500
the API project okay can I may I have my

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:35,460
slides okay perfect

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,250
so just a quick word on me I joined the

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,610
JPI community in 2006 and became a

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,469
official developer in 2007 and I'm also

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,510
one of the founder of the vision

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,879
inventory project which is the inventory

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,850
agent that we use which API to get the

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,010
inventory and at Tech lib and I'm the

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,680
GOP ID project manager I would say

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,809
project manager because we are team and

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,379
we take the decision together it's not

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,159
only about me so what is GPI it's an

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,670
open source project aiming at first

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,189
doing asset management so the idea with

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,140
Jeff bi that in one tool you have all

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,590
your data set of your company and you

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,860
try to see to have all that I needed to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,960
know exactly what kind of I said you

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,689
need to be knew when your license are

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,210
not going to be the warranty of your

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,240
asset is going to be a to expire this

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,759
kind of things we do local inventory

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,000
using agent of other projects like

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,009
fission inventory oz process inventory

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,810
we are so doing network discovery remote

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,590
inventory for example for switches

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,540
printers or other devices now on the

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,270
network and we also do software

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,759
deployment the idea with the this

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,399
solution is to be portable meaning that

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,280
we have agent for Windows platforms

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:02,280
Linux is micro a6 Solaris hp-ux VMware

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,890
Windows Mobile and Android the idea the

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,920
behind this is to inventory everything

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,050
on the network it's like big work it

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,209
never hands but it's the goal that we

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,700
try to achieve

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,849
the other big feature is the IT Service

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,040
Desk we try to follow a chi bad

00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,349
practices by providing your internet and

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,180
because management problem and change

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,640
management we also have a knowledge base

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,650
and there are some other interesting

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,379
features like a plug-in API so you can

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,469
write your own plug-in to function to

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,389
connect you with another solution or to

00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,549
enhance or change the behavior of the

00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,659
the code of the product and we also

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,030
introduced two years ago I plug a REST

00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,769
API so you can directly interact with

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,599
the with G API using this API

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,120
what is the origins of the project well

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,840
in fact everybody might be a small

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,480
association with 5pc to a large company

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,099
with the one hundred thousand PC might

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,200
be a public sector private sector

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:09,810
there's no no specific target audience

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,540
the technology is PHP my sequel notes

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,659
page opinion and by a DB because because

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,190
of because we are more fun of my a bit

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:22,669
and dynamite sequel but these choices

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,959
have been made we just explained that

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,439
thirteen years ago and for the moment it

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:33,299
shows are already in place what kind of

00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:38,639
tool do we use while we use github we

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:40,319
use atom for unit testing we use

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,340
composer well in fact we use all

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,340
standard PHP tools for developing we use

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,689
transifex for translation and with the

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,939
docs for documentation we also have

00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,519
several ways to interact with users and

00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:00,389
developers but the first is IRC channel

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,870
of course we use audible due to mailing

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:06,419
list and for idea box and suggestion we

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,669
use user echo which is quite interesting

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:13,470
to interact with user before they open

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:15,900
ticket on github we use telegram a lot

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,430
we have several channels in several

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,950
languages we also like oh great data

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,810
coming from different tools

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:30,900
and of course Facebook and Twitter the

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,200
project started in 2003 it was needed by

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,140
an association doing 13 years until 2015

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,050
to dispel the association did a

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,730
wonderful job they started from nothing

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,190
and the Builder community and the

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,900
project began successful and we is now

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,570
used everywhere around the globe

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,490
but after 13 years developers they were

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,920
exhausted and they wanted to do

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,370
something else so after some discussions

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,360
the glib we took the lead on the project

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,840
meaning that there is always the

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,420
community we always developed the

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,730
project the same way but we hire some

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:13,230
people to work full-time on the project

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,590
and we also the the company in charge of

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,920
the run method of the project so it was

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,980
like a big change we have to explain to

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,900
all people we're afraid that we were

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,640
that the project of one be open-source

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,760
an emotion no no not going to change

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,830
always it will always be open source we

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,310
are also going to add more and more

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,140
people to work on the project so we can

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,570
we can change what need to be changed

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:47,850
and in 2017 we are version 9.1 and we

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:50,640
are about to release 9.2 in September at

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,620
a clip the team is 10 people in France

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,690
in Spain and the communities based on

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,620
various kind of people integrators who

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:04,440
are doing a project for their customers

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,330
financed individuals some companies are

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,280
users and have their own developers and

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,350
they contribute to what is really

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,210
important for them and of course

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,520
translators but the project is

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,780
translated in like 45 different

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,980
languages on 20 flex when two challenges

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:26,210
is what becomes interesting the project

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,770
has started in 2003 before all

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,510
frameworks and can think so there is a

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,150
specific framework insider under the

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,630
project and for some part of the product

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,630
project people who had written this

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,480
is part of the project I got there are

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,770
not on the project anymore so sometimes

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,260
happens that we have lost lost knowledge

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,080
we have some specs but sometimes specs

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,910
are quite light and there is no unit

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,220
test so we have to rewrite progressively

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,910
the project which is quite a big task

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,090
because you have a 13 years of project

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,150
with no test and what you can you can

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,630
say I'm going to rewrite from scratch

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,120
and what will become of the community or

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,480
you you want to make some changes in

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,640
incremental changes so we decided to go

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,110
this way incremental changes and we

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,450
always have to do the balance between

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,940
adding a new feature because if you ask

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,610
you tell you users ok we are not going

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,190
to add any feature doing two years I

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,230
think that we are going to switch to

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,290
another products but at the same time

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:41,880
when we add new features we always have

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:45,480
to we write we write from part of the

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,010
decoded product add the test so it's

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:53,130
quite a big work and we have to balance

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,830
to make the balance in writing the test

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,250
for 13 years of project that was not in

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:03,420
turn to be tested is also quite quite a

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,730
challenge on the community side we were

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:11,430
going to introduce soon a new website

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:15,930
and we have a lot of users and they did

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,880
a quite work they wrote books they did a

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,050
lot of things they do a lot of things

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:25,020
but as we don't speak the language it's

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,480
sometimes hard to be in touch with the

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,880
dis community for example are one of the

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,930
biggest community after french-speaking

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,469
people is brazilians it's huge in Brazil

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:41,640
but we don't have any we have only few

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,670
contact with them so we have to talk to

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,070
the guys we speak English and they can

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,290
introduce you to us to the other

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,460
developers and we can discuss with them

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,530
how we can get there

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,470
integrate their code or integrate the

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,690
the idea they had so it's very

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:03,590
interesting work but it's also

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:07,680
time-consuming the contribution workflow

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:10,620
by switching to github and get we now

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,240
it's not much more easier for us to

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:18,480
integrate contributions coming from

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,380
contributors so now for pull requests we

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,230
the unit tests are becoming mandatory

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,480
but the problem is that for example if

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,330
someone does a pull request on the just

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,490
one part of the ticket features we are

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,500
not going to ask in to do the unit tests

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,340
for the whole feature so we first have

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,280
to write the clip on our own own write

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,440
the unit test for the main features to

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,440
be able to ask the director contributors

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,750
then to write the unit test which is

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,730
also big work we also need more

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,860
reviewers meaning that we have to hire

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,690
more people and train these people so

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,660
they get the norwich functional

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,720
knowledge of the product and we also

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,490
have to write the documentation we did a

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:10,920
good job last year to update and rewrite

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:13,800
the developer documentation and all that

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,870
is to attract new contributors we have

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,150
contributors but we need more

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,080
contributors but to do that we have to

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:24,360
show that we are willing to to rewrite

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,530
things to professional the professional

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,700
the the project so that's why it's going

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:36,930
to take more but it's project really

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:40,200
need swap it and the product well the

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,450
main issue for me is the user

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,660
documentation the user documentation for

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,180
the domain is bad really bad and mainly

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,100
in French so we have to update the

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,060
French documentation translated it into

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:57,750
English and then English is going to be

00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,050
the master language and translation can

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,050
be done we also have to rewrite the user

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:08,300
interface in JavaScript

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:11,360
and we are going to introduce I think

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,770
make sure the support for that gray SQL

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,980
and model basis but at the same time

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,500
we're working on other projects that

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,060
integrate with the GPI the first is

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,610
called five and then in the mobile

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:33,730
device management solution so it's been

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:36,529
on top of of GLP i it uses a MQTT for

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:40,010
data exchange between the mobile devices

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:44,089
and ng LPI it's also open source on

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:46,550
github and for Android and iOS so we use

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:51,230
GP I use the core of the application but

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:55,310
we have written a new interface that is

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:58,790
a forester basis for the new device we

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:03,860
want for for for children and the second

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:06,170
project for maybe next I think mixture

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,800
is Alma dito it's an open-source

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:13,130
antivirus for Linux and windows with

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,520
winter protection and it uses two and

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,050
joined

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,240
Klamath and the yarra for signatures and

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:23,209
the console for managing antiviruses is

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,730
chipiya so that's why first it's very

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,130
important to rewrite the API and make it

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,899
a modern application because in your

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:36,410
strategy we want to have more product

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:38,120
based on the idea on top of JPA so the

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:43,339
code is open source and you can find it

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,260
at github also so in fact we want you we

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,010
need more contributors in move need more

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,010
people to help us working on the project

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,820
thank you

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,820
