[Music]

00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,519
hello everybody

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,710
so yeah in fact I have two job at

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,110
Microsoft I'm in charge of disability

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,570
and accessibility and I'm also working

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,359
in the services division a 12 hour

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,070
customer moving to Windows 10 office 365

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,630
etc so the presentation I'm going to to

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,300
do today

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,849
first is focused on Microsoft

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,830
accessibility strategy just for you to

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,430
have an overview of what we are doing at

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,550
Microsoft what we are doing also in open

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,129
source with accessibility and a short

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,329
conclusion with a question and answer if

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:47,280
you need so first on the strategy so

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:50,129
when Satya Nadella arrived at the head

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,620
of Microsoft in fact he has two two

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,649
different figures that concern that that

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,020
meeting one on open-source in fact just

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,980
to be able internally first to be able

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,359
to share all the code for how everybody

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,360
previously at Microsoft there was some

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,630
some program group with very reduce

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,299
limited access to the code for example a

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,150
person in charge of Windows 10 doesn't

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,189
share of Windows sorry doesn't share the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,049
information with the office team

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,140
etcetera etcetera so it breaks the

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,720
barrier just first to be able internally

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,500
to to to have that openness internally

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,869
second

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,200
in fact Satya Nadella defined five

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,630
different wave at Microsoft and one

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,540
concern accessibility in fact as he has

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,110
two children concerned by disability so

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,060
is very focused on the subject and the

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,560
three main to TQ speak about regarding

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,829
accessibility is first the transparency

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,399
on all what we are delivering to our

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,259
customers to to everybody because it's

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,020
important for us as we are working with

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:06,360
a very large ecosystem to be able to

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,099
share that second a focused on Universal

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,379
Design sorry

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,330
Universal Design for us is the

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,360
possibility to

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,880
to start thinking about the usage a very

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,360
hurry and break the barrier at the

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,600
beginning meaning that you are thinking

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,190
of application and so on for everybody

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,580
and not just for a small group of people

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,590
so that's that quite important and the

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,160
third one is how we can be more

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,310
inclusive inside Microsoft so he has for

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,860
example last year we had a plan to to

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,890
focus on hiring a person having

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,950
visibility with Asperger for example

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,680
last year a large number of people have

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,550
been hired by Microsoft just because

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,160
they are contributing to to hold what we

00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:00,420
are they'll ring if you want really to

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,480
to be - to be performant for your

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,030
customer you need at least two - seems

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,830
like the customer and in fact when you

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,550
are speaking with a large different

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,770
company you you understand that

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:18,000
disability is very very important just

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,550
for internal needs but also for the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,790
customer of our own customer so it's

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,850
important to be focused on that if you

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,010
have just that just to sign - to explain

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,660
the difficulty regarding disability

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,150
because the first of all many of people

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,580
in charge of accessibility or in charge

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,440
of developing application are focused on

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,440
the reduce and limited part of of

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,540
disability for example you are doing

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,470
things for blind people or things for a

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,060
cognitive problem issues etc etc but you

00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:00,170
have also some duties that are not

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,030
really consider and very difficult to to

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,910
to answer as inside it's a mix a

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,459
different kind of visibility like for

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:13,350
example Parkinson or ALS or things like

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:17,130
that why it's important to focus on

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,989
accessibility first life is increasing

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,780
and the number of years you are working

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,600
in company is increasing also so I

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,190
there's much more and much more people

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,830
concerned by that

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,080
you have also a legal constraint to

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,350
manage in fact because in fact the law

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,920
are enforcing things on accessibility

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,110
and with European Allu it's going

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,400
stronger and stronger which is great and

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,810
in fact it force company to to work on

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,030
that and to be more inclusive internally

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,450
there's also huge potential of business

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,200
on that as in fact developing things for

00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,010
a larger number of people makes you have

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,540
more customers so it's important

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,760
Microsoft have also a social

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,030
responsibility because lots of users are

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,280
using Windows PC etc etc so you need to

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:15,480
consider all everybody when you are

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,910
delivering such product one very

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,830
important aspect for me is in fact

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,080
technology are changing the world we are

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:31,800
seeing lots of new things arising with

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:34,740
with for example all the different

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,520
aspect you you are you are seeing for

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,520
intelligence

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,880
we are lots of different things re you

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,430
can also be concerned because lots of

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,550
people are touch in their life

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:55,530
by disability and also it's it's very

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,690
good to 12 people inside if you are

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,300
concerning considering accessibility

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,430
inside our our marks of product I'm

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,130
splitting it in three different area

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,290
first what we are natively delivering

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,070
inside Windows on the face because it's

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,770
a basis for lots and lots of company

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,870
second which product can be concerned by

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,360
accessibility scenario if you are

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,180
considering for example cortana or or

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,880
the competition of cortana being able to

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,090
speak with the machine is very important

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,150
for some visibility you have also skype

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:35,310
for example that who lewis to to do some

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,650
some TD work for example so it's

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,360
important for people having a

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:45,180
a limitation regarding or going that and

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,580
also inside Skype you are seeing much

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,190
much more features that allow you also

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,710
to to deal with different language

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:57,810
things I get a third part concern

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,419
accessibility content because you need

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,870
to deliver content which are accessible

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:06,210
so we are enforcing that including

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,360
accessibility checker for example inside

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,789
of this or for example being able when

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,300
you send a mail to somebody that needs

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:17,400
to have accessibility mail just to

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,530
inform the person who is going to send

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,810
that may of that you need to create your

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,120
mail has a document that need to be

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,669
accessible so that things that have

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,669
arrived in in oh geez

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,940
I'm going to to pastor quickly on that

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,160
side in fact that important for us as a

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,400
company that delivers windows and office

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,770
to produce more and more native

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,870
accessibility features because it's cost

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,410
saving for our customer to to promote

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,660
that if you need to if you have by

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,169
default features inside Windows on

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,860
office then you don't need necessary to

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:02,159
include complimentary things and then

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,250
all your machine could be quite standard

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,690
and it's important for the idea of of

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,840
our our customers today you have some

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,639
product compliance things also that we

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,650
are providing just to check the

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,990
difference between what we are

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:22,620
delivering on the Thunder because it's

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,479
important to to inform what we are

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,159
covering inside there is very different

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,340
and odd

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,380
there are lots of things we are saying

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,770
also to our customer if you consider

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,190
that for example you have some some old

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:41,039
application maybe just considering to an

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,400
end the UI allow you to pay for

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,079
accessibility changer inside those

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,690
application meaning that for example if

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,270
you optimize the way you are using

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,310
application and

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,150
the way you access the feature because

00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:03,510
that's the most common feature are quite

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:06,510
quickly accessible then you you can win

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,270
time for all the users and then use that

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:14,010
time to to pay for accessibility

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:15,780
features that's the strategy for

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,500
Microsoft France it just saying that a

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,400
disability for us is inside a different

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,440
kind of subject like all what we are

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,630
considering as diversity and inclusion

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,210
so disability is one subject in in the

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,340
diversity and inclusion list and the

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,380
three first topic we are covering for

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,200
disability change perception employment

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,900
an announcement and simplify day-to-day

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,420
it's what you are seeing in all

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,840
different politics regarding disability

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:52,110
in red company we are also pushing a lot

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,060
in the way we can impact the society so

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,600
working with students working with

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:03,900
medical staff etc helping to use

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,090
technology to help on that Microsoft and

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,510
open source so we are quite engaging in

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,820
a open source I'm not a specialist of

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,800
all what is inside that slides of that

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,170
the history of open source so we have

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,390
including and worked with lots of people

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:24,000
engaged in open source and we have a

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,240
first thing to say is we have an

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,350
approach in the cloud so we want you to

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,370
adapt our cloud to be able to to

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,770
integrate and to to to use all what is

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,980
delivered by the the open source

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,900
community on our Clyde so that that's

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,770
the first the first topics we are

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:50,180
working on regarding disability we have

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:53,790
delivered what we are calling inclusive

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:57,720
design inclusive design it's in fact a

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,610
way to to think about your application

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,720
at the beginning so you need to

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,080
recognize exclusion first learn from

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,200
diversity the second

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,150
part and try to solve for one an ex-nun

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,930
too many so that is three different

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:15,610
topics we are covering inside that that

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,750
design toolkit and we are delivering

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,060
free we free in a free manner all that

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,120
patterns that allow you when you need to

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,580
think about accessibility you have some

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,310
I would say activity card that you can

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:37,180
use just to engage some exchange during

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:41,860
a session of including intuitive design

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:46,240
sorry so you can you can access to to

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:49,990
that red book just with lime so adjusted

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,390
okay boy MS inclusive design and you can

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,360
access to that book and activity cards

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,310
also I am translating that influential

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,220
so if if somebody interesting get a

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,860
second so we have a development platform

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,440
what we are calling Uwe Universal

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:15,160
Windows platform that deals is all the

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:17,050
different kind of of machine and we are

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,080
delivering some toolkit and things like

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:26,080
that just to be able to develop

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:30,220
application in a more inclusive way we

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,910
are also work working sorry on different

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,040
component as a UW zty community toolkit

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,080
so is something we are delivering for

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,940
you to build applications with some

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,810
control some different kind of things

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,990
that are accessible so it has been

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,460
published on on github so you can you

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,680
can access to it and you have also an

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,440
application that do some demos of all

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,270
that have been developed around that so

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,540
if you want to develop an application

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:03,010
with some control that are accessible

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,990
you can use it we have also ordered so

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,210
that's a sample we have also a pad

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,710
generalizer which is a tool that allows

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,790
you to improve your website

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,780
accessibility so it's also a public

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,470
publication on github

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:21,320
a very important thing is the Microsoft

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,260
community service use so it's a set of

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,910
cloud services that allow you to easily

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:32,360
integrate in your application some some

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:37,850
things related to vision speech language

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,830
etc so it's a it's a set of services if

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,870
you want for example to integrate in

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,090
your application voice recognition or

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,770
things like that you can easily use that

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,330
with reading a three line of code you

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,700
have integrated that in your application

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,550
so you don't have to deal with the

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,640
complexity of that it's some cloud

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,970
services you can use and we are we are

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:03,890
delivering a toolkit to be able to use

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:10,940
that Microsoft services services so the

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:15,130
link is written that it's on- also as a

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,120
confusion in fact if we are doing about

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,880
accessibility and open source as

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,970
Microsoft our vision is if you are doing

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,660
inclusive design you had cloud and you

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,840
had open source then you can have a full

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,610
set of accessibility things which can

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,680
deal with all the difficulty and all the

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,220
complexity of accessibility in your

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,220
application

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,109
