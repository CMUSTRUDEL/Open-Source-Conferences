Description: 
	SpagoBI joined the FIWARE project in 2014 as Data Visualization component.
The FIWARE mission is “to build an open sustainable ecosystem around public, royalty-free and implementation-driven software platform standards that will ease the development of new Smart Applications in multiple sectors”.

Following this mission and thanks to this collaboration, SpagoBI was enriched with new capabilities that can be exploited in Smart Cities and IoT scenarios, in particular:
1. capability to explore and analyze data coming form CKAN (the well known Open Data portal)
2. NGSI standard adoption (both as producer and consumer of context data)

The presentation will provide a short introduction to the FIWARE ecosystem, then it will go into more details on complex scenarios where the data visualization (SpagoBI and Knowage) is involved.
