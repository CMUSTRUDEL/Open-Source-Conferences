Title: OW2con'17 Knowage & FIWARE  the new ecosystem for Smart Applications Davide Zerbetto
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	SpagoBI joined the FIWARE project in 2014 as Data Visualization component.
The FIWARE mission is “to build an open sustainable ecosystem around public, royalty-free and implementation-driven software platform standards that will ease the development of new Smart Applications in multiple sectors”.

Following this mission and thanks to this collaboration, SpagoBI was enriched with new capabilities that can be exploited in Smart Cities and IoT scenarios, in particular:
1. capability to explore and analyze data coming form CKAN (the well known Open Data portal)
2. NGSI standard adoption (both as producer and consumer of context data)

The presentation will provide a short introduction to the FIWARE ecosystem, then it will go into more details on complex scenarios where the data visualization (SpagoBI and Knowage) is involved.

[Music]

00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,480
okay so let's start my name is David

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,260
adsorbate Oh

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,130
I work for engineering group I come from

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,130
Italy and today I will give some key

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,849
points of the knowledge and fiber

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,210
projects the development we made in

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,189
knowledge regarding the power platform

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,579
how we integrate with other components

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:39,120
equally in the power project I don't

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,510
know if you have a lot about flour maybe

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,640
some of you I will give you just some

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:50,789
key points of the father platform so

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,399
today Internet of Things big data and

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,960
cloud are the major technology drivers

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,530
of a new era or smart solutions but

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,589
actually what makes an application

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,830
really be smart if you want your

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,310
application to be IOT enabled and to be

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,299
smart the key point is the application

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,360
should be context aware and the meaning

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,500
of being consumer is provided by this

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,869
slide this guy is washing his car while

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,930
it's raining and of course it doesn't

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:33,990
make much sense so context matters the

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,880
application should be contest aware the

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,130
application should recognize what's

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,170
going on in the real world should

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,079
retrieve information from several

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,439
sources from IOT devices from other

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:52,439
sources also and the application should

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:56,790
react accordingly so the main component

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,070
of the fire platform is an application

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,009
that is able to manage the context

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,820
information the context information is

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,820
the key point

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,000
of course there are also other

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,870
components within the fibre platform

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,110
that are able to capture data to process

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:23,910
and analyze data and at the end to

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:26,970
provide an action into the real world so

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,030
today we speak about smart cities

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,760
scenarios smart agriculture scenarios

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,390
smart industry scenario and we of course

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,810
have to retrieve and manage account info

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,170
contact information at a large scale

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,900
suppose for example you have a crop and

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,630
the humidity of the ground is high it

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,450
doesn't make sense to water the crop of

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,300
course so if you water the crop if the

00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:00,780
immunity is high is like you are washing

00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:03,480
your car during a raining day the other

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,440
key points in the father project is the

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:12,709
standard dpi fiber provides a standard

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:18,660
open API and a standard data model for

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:20,430
assessing context information and what

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,380
are the benefits of this approach of

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:29,280
course you can build an application and

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:32,700
you can use that application in many

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,620
scenarios in this example you have two

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:39,000
cities Porto and Santander they are

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,519
modeling the data using the fiber

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,489
approach they are providing a fire

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,100
endpoint and therefore if you write an

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,650
application that is exploiting the fiber

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,820
data model and the power endpoint you

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,790
can you can use this application in all

00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,600
the cities that are using this approach

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,930
so of course users will enjoy a portable

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,940
solutions and intrapreneurs also will be

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,590
able to benefit of the opportunities of

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,050
a larger market okay again that it makes

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,720
sense to provide directions to users for

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,989
a parking if the parking is as full

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,760
of course not so we should get all the

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,270
information process the information and

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:33,740
provide to the user something that is

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:36,440
useful and from the developer developer

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,350
point of view it should be very easy to

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,390
build this kind of application

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,990
exploiting the data model and exporting

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,780
the standard API from the developer

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,500
point of view getting the value from a

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,310
sensor should be as easy as reading an

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,690
attribute of an entity through a simple

00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,480
HTTP call and on the other side if I

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,500
wanted to change the state to provide an

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,980
action through an IOT device I should be

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,870
able to perform this operation just

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:16,669
updating the attrib one attribute of an

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:21,110
entity and as a developer I should not

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:26,540
take care of the final IOT device that I

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:29,830
am connecting to so the audience re the

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,870
context information should be a layer

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:41,180
where I can forget about the lower

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:45,320
devices and the lower protocols fiber

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:49,220
also enables what now we call the data

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:53,419
economy if you are a data provider if

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,900
you are a IOT devices provider you can

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:59,479
also provide your data you can also

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,930
provide services on your data

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,330
and you can of course get money from

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,330
both the data and both the services

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:18,750
so this is the measure idea of the fiber

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,670
project the mission is to build an open

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,430
sustainable ecosystem around public

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,830
royalty-free and implementation driven

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,900
software platform standards that we do

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,210
that will easy the development of new

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:37,450
smart applications in multiple sectors

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:41,250
such as curious government a halt etc so

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:45,180
again fiber provides standard API and

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,450
also provide an open source reference

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:53,460
implementation of the standard API and

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:56,950
again also data models that we easy the

00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:02,590
the connection and the portability of

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:05,950
your solution so the context information

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,280
in fiber is managed by a component that

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:14,650
is the Audion context worker it is based

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,140
on the OMA and GSI specification that is

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,040
a powerful public and you're relatively

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:25,930
standard API and it is quite easy to

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:29,680
adopt and to exploit and GSI supports

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:35,830
also geo queries and linka data will be

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:42,010
supported quite soon so how does it work

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:44,460
behind the scenes the NGS I you can see

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:47,560
that the father context broker is

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:52,030
connecting to the IOT devices through

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,460
the IOT protocols the most variety of

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:58,300
the IT protocols are supported by the

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,430
Fowler context broker and of course the

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,330
connection with one IOT devices is

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,900
provided by a single iota agent that is

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:11,230
of course in charge of getting

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,510
information from the device and to

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,450
provide information to the context

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,270
manager and your application is

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,860
forgetting completely about deity

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,460
devices it is just exploit

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,199
in the northbound interface so the

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,870
application are just retrieving

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,659
information from the context manager and

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,829
they are also providing actions through

00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,829
the context manager

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,860
so once the context information is

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,899
gathered there are other fiber

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,839
components our fiber enables that can be

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,380
used fiber provides solutions for

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,690
advanced web based Yui open data

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,089
publication systems data and apps

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,269
visualization tools complex even

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,730
processing systems multimedia processing

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:06,170
tools and big data analysis and storage

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,959
solutions all those components are IOT

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:15,890
enabled they are connecting through the

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:19,519
context manager when we speak about open

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:22,130
data publication the reference

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,589
implementation here is second and of

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,100
course regarding the data visualization

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:33,649
the reference implementation is

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:38,329
knowledge knowledge already I was able

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:43,820
to query many data sources such as a

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:46,070
dupe cloud era spark MongoDB etc within

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:51,500
the for our project we also integrated

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:55,790
the second open data portal as you can

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,940
see second data sets are being displayed

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,680
such as all the other data sets that are

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,160
available within the knowledge platform

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,220
so you can have enterprise data set my

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,250
own data set and also the list of

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,970
available seek and data sets moreover I

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,290
can connect through one second instance

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:21,260
or also more than one second instances

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,949
of course this is useful of course in

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,320
order to provide traditional reporting

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:29,690
standard analysis but also those are

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,180
data set that can be exploited by final

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,180
users with a doc reporting tools

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,760
regarding the Audion contest poker we

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,720
developed two different scenarios the

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,230
first scenario is using no age as

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:53,490
context data consumer it means that no

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:58,010
age is able to retrieve values and to

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,410
and to update the view to the user

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:04,440
accordingly so this is a sort of

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,839
real-time analysis but of course you can

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,180
also have a traditional approach where

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,760
you store the data provided to the

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,850
Audion context broker into a database

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,550
SQL database new SQL database it doesn't

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,490
matter and then you can also perform a

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,480
historical analysis on top of that

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:27,870
database with knowledge the other

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,889
scenarios instead is using no age as

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:35,070
context data producer so I don't know if

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:38,610
you have a lot about KPI in Spokeo bi

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,880
and then in O age the idea is using

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,790
knowledge you can define complex key

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,980
performance indicator those key

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,199
performance indicators are combining

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,740
information that is coming from

00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:57,709
different sources such as I don't know

00:11:51,740 --> 00:12:01,230
new SQL database REST API whatever and

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:05,010
this data is combined to retrieve a KPI

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,829
and we use a mechanism in order to to

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:12,690
schedule the execution of this KPI

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:15,839
and we are able to send to the context

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,829
broker alarms so if there is any other

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,260
component that is listening for
