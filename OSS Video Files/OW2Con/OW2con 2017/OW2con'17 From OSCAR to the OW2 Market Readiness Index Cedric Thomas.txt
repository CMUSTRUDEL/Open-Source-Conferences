00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,610
right good afternoon again we are going

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,880
to share with you working progress so

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,180
you've had two kinds of presentations so

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,270
far one which is a commercial offering

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,730
very stable very material always

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,730
evolving and progressing I know but that

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,349
is already being used by established

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,810
companies established project and

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,850
organizations and you had two projects

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,860
that aim at developing methodologies to

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,520
collect data and put that data together

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,030
and format it and deliver it and as the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,559
video said loop with the development in

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,969
mind now in line with the theme of our

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,879
conference we have endeavored that

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,239
ability to go not one step further but

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,250
to to adopt the user perspective so we

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,199
have a vendor we have researchers now

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,619
you should look at ability to as users

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:13,979
as users we need to use data in order to

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,770
help users out there I mean download

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,820
people who download the software

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:22,430
understand select the other between

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,229
project and in doing so we may add some

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,640
value to the project so what I'm going

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,720
to share with you is really work in

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
progress

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,340
it's a perspective on how we perceive a

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,229
codebase and the value chain we will

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,400
remind you what is the office car

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,280
approach and then how we tend to create

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,310
this scale of market readiness index

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,200
which will be rated in the scale of

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,780
market readiness levels I will share

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,259
with you our initial stages of those

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,500
levels and our focus is not so much the

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,750
technology or the community but it's

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,689
more the market readiness really so it

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,930
goes a little bit one step further we

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,670
have lots of projects and I mean we fit

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,330
the project inside work of the value

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,190
chain so it's a market perspective we

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,680
have different kinds of projects we have

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,190
community projects that reflect the free

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,200
software movement we have project

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,830
commercial problems versus project

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,410
project that are supported by commercial

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,940
companies and we also have research

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,769
projects project that are driven by

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,690
ecosystems of companies collaboratively

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:40,050
working in developing new technologies

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,650
typically the set up of a European

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,110
project is with this kind of set up

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,690
these all these projects aim at doing

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,050
business and doing business or reaching

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,730
out to the market and having some money

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:58,590
flown back to the developers at some

00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:00,659
point now software software is code so

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,870
this takes coming we we've looked at

00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:07,310
that in a way that it's something that

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,480
many of you ingested I know this already

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,980
extinct in trying to understand and

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,220
figure out what kind of qualities are

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,470
there but for me or for the average the

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,599
conventional decision maker the one we

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,790
are talking to about at the roundtable

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,220
yesterday that doesn't mean anything

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,650
the moment you want to address a

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,750
customer to business with something this

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,349
software becomes a product or support

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,900
for a product a product is offering and

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:37,860
what makes a product it's not just the

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,569
code it's everything that goes on top of

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,459
the code that goes along with the code

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,099
it's the documentation is the training

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,629
it's the roadmap it's even the pricing

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,720
list it's our contract etc some support

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:56,580
this is what customers real-life

00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:00,540
customers expect they want a product so

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,299
what creates value is the product it's

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,849
everything that you can add after the

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,720
code and to reach out to the to the

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:14,060
customer usually developers or research

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,579
projects remain kind of upstream they

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,549
deliver proof concepts some codes some

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,079
demonstrators but then the rest is

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,010
something that really they don't really

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,330
bother or maybe

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,040
they don't have the resources to develop

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,650
they don't have the resources to develop

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,400
a systems integration type of offering

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,960
or a full-fledged documentation etc and

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,360
that's what we call we call that the

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,780
delivery challenge it's how you reach

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,020
how you feel this gap between the

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,090
developer or the development team and

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,860
the average end user or the mainstream

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,980
user to save aligned with the scheme of

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:54,840
our conference and who creates this

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:56,490
value it's the ecosystem when we talk

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,040
about open source we have of course the

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,380
contributors contributed but we also

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,430
have companies that help us support the

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,720
developers we had the systems

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,010
integrators that we we met yesterday who

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,290
integrate the software into business

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,290
solutions we have distribution vendors

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,410
like Red Hat or that aggregate component

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,390
in to productize platforms we have the

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,050
user themselves that contribute back to

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,430
the open source project and we also have

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,980
the open source organizations

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,100
organizations like Eclipse Apache Lynx

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,160
foundation OpenStack and audibly two are

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,340
here to support the project and to help

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,650
them build trust on the market but we

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,660
also support them by providing services

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,460
and typically to the visible price three

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,500
layers of services a technology

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,750
infrastructure to it to help the

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,120
development team work together some

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,450
governance to help build trust and

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,490
predictability into the product the

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,140
project and some market outreach

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,630
typically with some conferences like

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,850
this or other conference to which we're

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,360
where we participate this is material

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,570
life through three types of services and

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,410
it is in this context that we already

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:15,960
have developed a quality project program

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,400
that is currently operational which I

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,830
will let the Stephane describe to you

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,030
thank you and this program indeed is

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:30,840
called Oscar standing for open source

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:33,810
capability assessment radar and it's

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:38,910
running currently on

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:41,640
the server's that uh w2 so what is it

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:46,350
Oscar is actually both a mother and a

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,510
platform which in which you can see as a

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,880
way to implement the model the model we

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,060
call it open source maturity model or

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:59,550
mmm it's an outcome of previous European

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:03,960
project Calypso it was it was we

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:08,100
reworked and build urban and this model

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,460
is instrumented at the UH W to buy a set

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,350
of tools that you can see on this

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,600
diagram actually can serve this diagram

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,270
that Oscar hinges on two main pillars

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:24,380
the governance pillar and the

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:29,310
engineering pillar and each pillar is

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:32,790
covers a set of criteria and a set of

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,530
tools are made available to implement

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,669
this criteria so you can see that the

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,710
governance peden consists mostly of

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,620
license and IP management standards

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,740
implementation the way requirements are

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:53,490
managed et cetera engineering focuses

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:55,710
more on code bugs tests etc and at the

00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,390
top you can see that the goal of Ostara

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:05,790
is to bring high level metrics like

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:13,860
bitter jar that give insight about the

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:18,500
project so the first real tool of Oscar

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:22,950
is ohmmm it's a self-assessment form

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:26,400
containing 12 sections and that each

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:30,000
project leader to w2 is invited to fill

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,630
in especially the major projects which

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,650
have have to go through this process of

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:41,370
fulfilling the Roman Forum it's a way to

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:44,400
to check where they are in terms of open

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:50,810
source best practices in their

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:54,750
day-to-day management of the project the

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:59,520
scores obtained when filling in this

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:03,180
form are available as as Easter grant

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,400
that you can see on this slide on so

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,200
this is typically a typical dashboard of

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,050
an a w-2 project all the other other

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,730
projects at the w2 have dashboards more

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:20,420
or less filled in depending on the

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,620
maturity of the project another tab

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,780
title that with drivers

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:32,070
contains the outcome of the pathology

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,940
analysis against the code so we break

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:39,959
down in a list of licenses that are

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:44,430
present in the project and analyzed here

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:48,060
which is proactive when scheduling we

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,690
also provide metrics coming from

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:57,120
sonarqube

00:09:48,690 --> 00:10:00,390
static analysis of the code and we have

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,690
implemented who was talking about the

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,920
quality model it was in versus metal

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,980
right so we we have also implemented the

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,790
concept of quality model through a

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,640
project called riscos which lets the

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:23,660
visitor

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:29,610
define intervals of quality for each

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:32,490
criteria defined in OMM and this is the

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,339
result that the master the market

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:39,839
readiness at this point consists of

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:43,530
three main indicators related to

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:49,589
licenses quality and activeness it's a

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:53,040
it's a step toward a more confused

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:55,610
market readiness level that Cedric field

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,610
present now

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,730
Thank You Stefan

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,740
so this is exactly the what is

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,050
operational today what all mature

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,829
projects are implemented and that says

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,740
difference are developed we leverage

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:19,610
this through a set of but hundreds of

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:21,290
data and data points from the from that

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,050
we have rated the results of research

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,540
project so we're looking forward to what

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,570
those meter or even measure can provide

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,470
and as users we integrate these results

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,690
into a usable platform and we try to

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,050
simplify it in order to put that in the

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,029
hand of the average visitor on the other

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,620
PC website that can come from whatever

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,620
and we don't know so we need to simplify

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,199
we need to unjust realize it so to

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,829
productizing this for us is to make it

00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:55,910
more and more simple and that's how we

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:58,730
looked at different ways to simplify and

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,430
to evaluate which is are concerned the

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,199
market readiness not just the quality so

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,209
we looked at something that is very well

00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,029
known the technology readiness levels

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:12,079
which is a way of measuring the maturity

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:15,260
of a technology that goes from from the

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,339
bottom what's useless to at the top what

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,140
is totally established and mature so we

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,180
were looking at that and you know you've

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,060
all familiar in the research industry of

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,850
course with this the scale which has

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,730
been developed by the NASA then reviews

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,430
by the department difference and also by

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,490
the Department of Energy and that has

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,050
some some audacity actual definitions

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,209
where at the bottom you have the basic

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,399
principles observed then technology

00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,569
concept is formulated and at the top you

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,220
have the thing that has been fried

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:51,319
proven so it's the the piece of space

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,600
artifact that went in orbit and came

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,310
back if it had to come back but that is

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,399
operational and that they are planning

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,130
to reuse so that's that's a very good

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,680
idea thing and we were thinking like if

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,579
half of the word in research use this

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,250
scale

00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,900
maybe we can we can you

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,550
it in a way so we did a little bit of

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,650
research and we came across that one

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,880
that scale which is the same thing put

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:20,120
from left to right and where you see the

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,830
devolution in terms of from the research

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,990
to the left to the market to the right

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,210
interestingly you see that the players

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,400
are not exactly in sales they evolve you

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,190
see the research the Academy milik world

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,200
is some government agencies at some

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,180
point then in towards the middle to the

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,530
right you see so maybe the startups take

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,750
over the technology that has been

00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,820
developed and then maybe the large

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,540
companies take care and all the dominant

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,460
companies commercial the sales the

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,160
technology so that's an application of

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,620
the scale to the market and incidentally

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,240
the red line is the available funding so

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,800
you start with funding to the right way

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,260
the government with government funding

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,230
then you get into some sort of

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,670
uncertainty zone where some startups are

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,830
trying to make money out of it and maybe

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,310
go bankrupt or no and either succeed

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:10,070
they eventually burst and with a lot of

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,930
money towards the right of the scale and

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,940
we also by doing some research we came

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,980
across a venture capitalist an

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:20,200
investment company that is using this

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,390
for their own use decision making by

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,440
rating the maturity of potential

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,990
investments that's very simple so we

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,140
thought we had scores of data on one

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,800
hand maybe an idea of how to use that

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,350
and this is how we decided to work on

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,510
the output other way to market readiness

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:46,700
levels from ml 1/2 ml or 9 I want to

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,740
represent something but I already

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,010
announced it so today what I'm

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,380
presenting you is not the finished

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,070
saying it's really working progress so

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,910
it's like a call for contribution really

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,220
I'm opening up the books it's I'm

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,020
inviting you into the kitchen and I'm

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,610
showing you now where we are with the

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:14,150
the levels one thing you have to bear in

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,480
mind today with Oscar we have a

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,970
scorecard a scorecard is like it says it

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,960
cards two dimension card where we have

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,620
data and we have

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,050
figure out our own synthesis on idea so

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,980
what we really want to do is take all

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,950
these two-dimensional this mesh of

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,240
results and put them all aligned in a

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,660
one-dimensional scale that's the idea

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,820
like the machining stars and we realized

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,860
if I go if we think of what I've just

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,440
presented that each of this level

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,690
represents a scenario it's a scenario

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,980
situation and maybe it's radically

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,050
different it's qualitatively different

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,530
from situation one to situation two to

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,780
20 2003 to 2004 and this situation is

00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,600
characterized by something very strong a

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,000
strong element that makes it different

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,480
from the one before from the one after

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,790
and that is the rhythm and evolution in

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,170
market maturity so we still looking for

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:17,210
that that perception so um this is what

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,090
we're after I try to simplify it so that

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:22,850
we can share it very quickly so the

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:26,420
level level one oh and I've on the right

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,310
you have the keywords from the NASA TRL

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,810
thing so basic principles for us it's

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,100
research in terms of technology intel

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,170
from the business perspective we're

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,000
still in the research stage in terms of

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,030
technology we develop the method the

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,960
technology the Kyary algorithms so it's

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:47,480
basic code developed and we have many of

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,910
this collaborative project that don't go

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,400
much further than that actually then the

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,200
second level which would be application

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,290
field another for us it's where the

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,000
basic Rd code has been developed and we

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,270
already have at least one demonstrated

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,970
use case so this is pretty much in what

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,520
the cooperative projects can can develop

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,530
we have the POC and we still will the

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,810
process of developing so we have few

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,230
have identified project like this number

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,390
three

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,339
level three is where we start

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,980
understanding the usefulness of the

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,540
thing because of up till now it was

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,600
probably a solution in search of a

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,520
problem but now you we can match the the

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,670
technology we're developing with actual

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,770
problems and we see how can be useful

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,520
and we know how what we call the golden

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,140
scenario how the user can actually use

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,030
I mean the kind of data they need the

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,610
kind of inter interaction they need the

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,920
kind of a security they need the kind of

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,510
results so we have this this process

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,370
that is that what is defined and

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,980
probably because we already have one

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,080
declared user that has had providers

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,380
already some feedback and helps refine

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,960
the requirements number four we have the

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,750
usefulness really demonstrated and now

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,940
we are ready in more business sense may

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,700
perhaps you to have a the minimal value

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,760
proposal that demonstrate define so we

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,680
know exactly what kind of the rough

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,780
shape of the product of what it what it

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,960
would be like we already have several

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,060
users we already have a somebody

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,490
committed to develop the product

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,440
somebody already who believe in it so we

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,730
already now are starting at something

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,740
that goes to both towards the market but

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,200
we still not have a real market and the

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,820
flow of commercial promotional sales so

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,560
now in number four this is what we have

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,510
we already have what would they call the

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,100
relevant environment validation we

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,680
already have some customers we already

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,530
have we open it to the market we've made

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,230
all the the commercial the move to

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,880
become commercial maybe we are hiring a

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,100
guy or somebody the development team is

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,430
becoming the evangelist of the sales rep

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,310
and good thing is we are confronted to

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:57,370
market expectations and by doing this we

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,710
are refining the end user interface now

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,380
we really have something that has to be

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,060
to mature up till now we were expecting

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,950
people to do the right thing now we

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,150
understand that we have users that might

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,460
not do the right thing might not

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:14,190
understand so we have to really look at

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:17,290
the demand make it user interface as

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,210
intuitive as possible on the fixed level

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,350
the good thing is that now in terms

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,570
technology we are the growing

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,630
interoperability it's not just a product

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,610
that we have somewhere that is on on its

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,800
side and that you use it or you don't if

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,270
it doesn't fit your environment what we

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,140
don't care we have it fit for that

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,940
environment now we have a product or

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,620
something that can support maybe more

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,070
than one database that can interface

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,710
with one more in one type of systems so

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,830
this is this is where we grow the the

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,659
interoperability so the usefulness is

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,490
more and you can broaden the market you

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,380
can address different kind of customers

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,289
not just those that are using that type

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,529
of system a lot and you can grow the

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:01,559
ener-d customer base and with this in

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:04,980
mind now you can start going and see VCS

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,779
you can see you can see the investors

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,600
because they can they can understand the

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,330
potential the next level we have is

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,789
where we have we because we addressing a

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:18,059
broader market we have implemented full

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:20,340
Q&A it's tested bug-fixing everything is

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,559
a computing pace and now we can actually

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,909
build the Builder market and this is

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,159
where I see a rocket chat now we can

00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:29,179
discuss this Gabrielle if you like but

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,159
we already have a an early customer base

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:36,240
and and now we keep going

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:39,450
the the ASA level is where in terms of

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,580
product we already now building the

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,320
projector and we know we have been fit

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,510
with this but we understand that they

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,789
can be more things coming that can be

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,830
that can complement the let's say we may

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,870
be with more than one version maybe we

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,120
have the VIP version and the entry-level

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,940
version maybe we have the complete one

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,429
or the package one we because we have

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,919
the broader the broad customer base to

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:03,659
do that and we are now actively

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,990
competitive competitive we are

00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:08,669
recognizing the market we're capable of

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,919
of standing and even giving keynote

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,659
speeches and the last level we have had

00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,000
at the time is that where we are

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,380
actually an established player we're one

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,950
of those recognized leaders on the

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,370
market with full support for the for the

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,679
for the product many customers even

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,169
customers are proud to speaker to speak

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,210
for you who come and say that okay I'm

00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,190
using this because you're kind of a

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,190
leader there is no question that you

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,590
this is a good product in place this is

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,909
where I see I'm sorry no way and not

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:45,600
salgo bi whatever and I've tried to

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:47,610
simplify so one letter and and then we

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
the the in terms of technology the

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,990
evolution is that it's more like it's

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,669
becoming a platform it's not just that

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,770
you have a range of product but its

00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,529
platform where you can expand the thing

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,630
by adding and connecting with partners

00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,990
and building your Eureka

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:07,170
system so that's the kind of

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,810
understanding we have of the trajectory

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,640
the market trajectory of project and

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,820
open-source project and we built this

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,640
bearing in mind that we need to apply

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:22,170
that to the commercially supported

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,970
project but also to those collaborative

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,240
project that are supported by an

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,210
ecosystem like the the publicly financed

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,760
projects or those foundations behind and

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,430
also the purely community-driven

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,130
projects that may or may not that so

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,790
this is where we're not we have all

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:45,090
these different that words define as

00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:49,650
mentioned the other different rating now

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:53,700
we are aligning all these two to help

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:56,370
build to feed the the rating of of each

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,250
project and that's the thing we are

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,440
currently developing and for which by

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,010
the way we will awaiting some of the

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,960
result of the project we demonstrated so

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,450
this is where we are if you have ideas

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,340
if you want to change this you're very

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,000
welcome because we really need to go

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:17,130
public with this and we really need to

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,830
support the I mean stress test is

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,600
something that is very welcome for that

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,940
thank you very much Oh summary open

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,620
source projects are different we already

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,630
have that's what I just said we already

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,510
have some data and we're looking that

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,360
unique scale that will help so the over

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,980
idea is that a user will go to the to

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,590
the other between marketplace look at

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,900
the project ot rl6 Terrell 9 ok but

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,210
that's it but with this we already out

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,400
helping them so it may be very simply

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,850
simplistic from the standpoint of the

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,870
academics in the room but we need

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,990
something that is useful very

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,180
instinctively

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,390
and very quickly by the average end-user

00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:01,939
out there that's all thank you

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,939
