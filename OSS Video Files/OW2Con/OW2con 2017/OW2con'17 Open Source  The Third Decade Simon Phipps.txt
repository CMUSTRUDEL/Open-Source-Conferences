Title: OW2con'17 Open Source  The Third Decade Simon Phipps
Publication date: 2017-06-28
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	OSI was established in 1998, and with it the term "open source" to describe software licensed to enable collaboration around free software. 2018 consequently sees the start of the third decade of open source. What changes will we see? What principles can guide us?

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:15,330
hello good morning so I'm here to talk

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,510
to you about the third decade of open

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,359
source I it seems strange to imagine but

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,800
open source has been around for 20 years

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,710
the open source initiative was started

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,810
in at the beginning of February in 1998

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,290
and we're going to be having a birthday

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,760
party at fuzzed M next year so I hope

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,160
you're going to come along and celebrate

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,500
with us we're actually planning a year

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,510
of rolling birthday parties so as to

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,890
outdo Oh W - because you've just got two

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,489
days of birthday party we're going to

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,680
have a whole year so let's talk about

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,390
the third decade of open source to do

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,579
that we've got to ask ourselves how we

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,000
got here how do we get to where we are

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:06,119
today so the way that we got to where we

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,750
are today is we started out by being

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,020
laughed at open source started in 1998

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,049
it started in 1998 as an antidote to

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,060
Richard Stallman's approach to free

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,100
software this is not because free

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,170
software is not the right answer free

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,130
software is exactly the right answer

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,680
it's just that in the Anglophone world

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:31,049
calling it free software is a mistake

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,479
because everybody who hears you say free

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,939
software if they have English as a first

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,280
language they immediately want to talk

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,970
to you about money and not about freedom

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,460
and it was impossible to explain this to

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,420
Richard he simply laughed at us when we

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,040
said that we need to use the phrase open

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,899
source instead of free software he said

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,149
free software is much more accurate and

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,790
we said yes Richard you're right it is

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,469
much more accurate but unfortunately it

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,799
needs much more explaining as well

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,530
because the word free comes with an

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,860
assumed meaning - lot to everybody who

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,450
speaks English it's all about zero price

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,450
so we started the open source movement

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,170
and the next thing that happened was

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,050
people started a fighter

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,540
in particular we had companies that were

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,040
from the UNIX world who decided they

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,470
were going to try and take the

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,370
opportunity that open-source was

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,460
creating and turn it into a hostile

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,490
revenue and we also had and this is this

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,020
is a more subtle picture we also had

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,720
companies like Microsoft fighting us

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,850
because they realized that their

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,800
approach to monetization had no future

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,020
in a world where everything was

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,250
open-source now this photograph I took

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,870
in in in Copenhagen this is one of a

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,350
kind you'll probably never see this

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,490
happen again this is a public protest by

00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,450
open-source geeks against our XML and

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:04,120
it's ratification at ISO and the street

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,880
was full of geeks waving banners

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,180
protesting against Microsoft and asking

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,920
the European Commission to intervene and

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,620
so this is a historic photo the first

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,620
and probably the last ever open source

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,860
street protest so we come on from there

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,800
because now after 20 years we've won how

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,350
do I know we've won well Apache Software

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,070
is now running pretty much every piece

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,050
of infrastructure in the world and on

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,620
top of patchy software there is software

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,900
from OpenStack and those two are really

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,459
in control of the world's infrastructure

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,130
they're not in control of the world's

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,350
personal computers although you'd be

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,840
surprised you're running all these

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,260
laptops and you're running software

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,940
that's hosted by companies like Google

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,920
well all of that software on your

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,959
desktop is open-source software it's

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,080
just that it's running on a seeps

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,790
open-source CPU somewhere else the thing

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,280
that's hosting your session may be

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,110
proprietary on your computer here but

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,200
the software you're running is all open

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,130
source the truth is the year of the open

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,660
source desktop was about ten years ago

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,450
we've been all been running open source

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:21,130
desktops for a decade now it's just we

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:23,770
mistake them for web browsers and then

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,050
it's very clear in enterprise use that

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,800
open source is one the future of open

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,319
source survey this year

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,169
sickly says that anybody who has got an

00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,389
operating brain recognizes they have

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,870
open source in their business and need

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,879
more of it so what's really worrying is

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,979
that there are ten percent of the people

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,310
interviewed by this survey who haven't

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:49,940
worked out that they're stupid yet and

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,590
then there's this now actually I don't

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,590
believe this I don't believe Microsoft

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,990
does love Linux I believe that Microsoft

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,810
is still applying their patent portfolio

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,569
to tax Linux and to put out of business

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,840
anyone who competes using it but they do

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,460
depend on it for Azure and consequently

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,110
it's in their interests to say that they

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,270
love it at the moment but this could

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,759
never have happened in the past so the

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,030
first of all open source was laughed at

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,639
twenty years ago then open source was

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,090
fought against ten years ago and now

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,560
it's won now why did it work I'd like to

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,879
suggest to you some reasons why open

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,860
source worked the first one is that the

00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,029
free software idea is to talk about

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:38,599
ethics it is to talk about the right of

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:41,569
people to have freedoms but businesses

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,979
aren't people businesses are sets of

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:50,419
processes people are have ethics and

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:55,069
morals companies are just powered by

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:57,740
animal instincts they're powered by fear

00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,650
a fear of competition and their fear

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,550
powered by need by a need to generate

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,800
revenue and anything which is not about

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,889
mitigating fear or mitigating hunger is

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,620
of no interest to a corporation it's of

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,229
interest to you as an employee of that

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,389
corporation morals and ethics matter to

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,639
you but they don't matter to a company

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,440
all that matters is whether it's

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,219
operating to its business principles an

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,500
open source took free software and

00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,840
turned it into something that could be

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,479
measured against revenue and could be

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,659
measured against market control and

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,690
people embraced open-source while they

00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:40,310
claimed to reject free software what

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,150
they didn't realize where they were

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,160
accepting

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,410
free-software all along because

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,140
open-source has always been free

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:53,090
software repackaged secondly I used to

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,220
work at IBM a long long long time ago

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,490
and one of the things I worked on was

00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:03,650
code reuse code reuse has been a desire

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,270
of geeks who are about to retire for the

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,300
whole of the history of computing

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,120
we've always wished people would reuse

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,250
but in software engineers don't want to

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,190
reuse because they know they will have

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,940
to adapt and they've found that learning

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,040
someone else's code and then adapting it

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,600
is slower than writing it from the

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,060
beginning

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,220
now what open source lets you do it lets

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,460
you start with other people's code and

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,830
adapt it and then let the adaptation go

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,950
back into the core product so somebody

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:40,210
else maintains your changes and it turns

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,970
out that attribute appeals to every geek

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,130
every geek wants to invent something new

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,600
but no geek wants to maintain the thing

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:52,730
they invented and so open source

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,940
encourages reuse by taking away the

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,890
maintenance of change and that's the

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,170
second reason it succeeded the third

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,190
reason it succeeded is because it had

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,650
ISI behind it now you may not see OSI in

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,530
the news every day but OSI is doing some

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:13,750
important things for you all the time

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:17,120
first of all what OSI is doing is OSI is

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:21,050
helping consensus about open source

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,420
issues crystallize so what we do is we

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,730
we let for example the license review

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,070
mailing list discuss a new open source

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,610
license and we then crystallize the

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,980
consensus we remember the consensus and

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,650
we protect the consensus

00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,600
so Patrick Masson who's our general

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,210
manager spends a lot of time writing

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,280
letters to companies who say their code

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,830
is open source but is not under an

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,560
open-source license he spends a lot of

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,010
time looking for people who are using

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,590
this trademark and are not using it in a

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,889
way that represents software freedom so

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,549
we

00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:01,189
quietly patrol the perimeter of open

00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:03,679
source and we ensure that people

00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:06,529
discover that the consensus of the

00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,859
community is that this logo means

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:13,819
software freedom and in the cases where

00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:15,589
it doesn't your hear from us I think

00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:20,470
those are the three reasons open-source

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:24,769
has succeeded the it has been able to

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,079
create a path of least resistance for

00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,480
enterprises to a free software it has

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,699
been able to encourage developers that

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,160
free software is the way to go rather

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,839
than building new and it has been able

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,269
to protect the boundaries of that

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,579
consensus and prevent it from becoming

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:43,429
corrupted all of those are very subtle

00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,429
things but I believe that they carry

00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:48,859
forward into the future of open-source

00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:51,379
so here's my views about the trends that

00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:54,410
are going to affect us for the the next

00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:57,679
10 years first of all I think we're

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,959
going to see community divergence now

00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,079
the history of free software and open

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,279
source has been to start with the end

00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:08,869
user and the hobbyist and then

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,480
commercial use of software has always

00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:14,209
been permitted but has always been the

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,169
second case and then enterprise

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,999
deployment has been an afterthought and

00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:22,790
that has gradually changed over the last

00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,949
20 years and I believe over the next ten

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,259
we'll see about much more of our

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:30,199
divergence between projects which are

00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,749
aimed mainly or aimed and staffed mainly

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:35,709
by hobbyists I think we'll see those

00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:37,970
projects being casual projects or at

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:41,899
charitable hosts like software freedom

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:45,319
Conservancy then we'll see professional

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:49,789
specialist projects such as the kind

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:54,619
that ow2 works on but also projects like

00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:57,619
OpenStack which are projects where the

00:10:54,619 --> 00:11:00,889
companies involved focus mainly on that

00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:03,230
particular piece of software they're not

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,489
projects that are typically used in

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,769
combination with many many other

00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,450
portions to make a deployment they're

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,940
typically projects that are

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,650
a big topic in their own right and I

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,600
think we'll see those working with in

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,520
charity consortium like Oh w-2 like the

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Apache Software Foundation in America

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,890
and then finally I think we'll see the

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,990
rise of professional generalists

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,060
I think hobbyists were the first decade

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,820
of open source I think professional

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,280
specialists were the second decade of

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,810
open source and the third decade of open

00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,420
source will see the rise of the

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:42,500
professional generalist people who work

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,020
for large and integrate a complete stack

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:49,340
of open source software to deliver a

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,860
solution people who work within a

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,470
community like eclipse which has many

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,320
tools that can be used to produce

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,360
integrated solutions I think that the

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,050
professional generalists will tend not

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,740
to be paid to create direct wealth from

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,730
open source but rather to solve wealth

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,840
creating problems using open source and

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,270
so I think this is going to be an

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,550
important trend over the next decade the

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,100
move towards professional generalists in

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,710
open source and I would note the

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,020
professional generalists very much needs

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,530
software freedom but we'll come back to

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:29,780
that this will come as bad news to the

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,150
people in the room who work for single

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,520
project companies but I don't think

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,400
there are going to be any more of them I

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,460
think that I do still hear people

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,620
debating open source business models but

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,360
they are typically people who made their

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,880
career debating open source business

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,950
models and have never had a second idea

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,510
and today no one really cares about open

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,310
source business models no one cares

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,140
about your open source business model

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,410
because open source is not about

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,450
business models anymore open source

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,520
companies today are companies that

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,380
integrate many projects they're

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,720
companies that take an open source

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,210
framework and use it with an open source

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,450
programming language and combine it with

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,170
an open source server and an open source

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:21,560
messaging solution and they use open

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,209
source DevOps tools and they use open

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,639
source

00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:26,949
load balancing tools and everything is

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,990
open-source but the people who work with

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,999
it are not about any one of those

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,869
projects they are about the whole

00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:36,429
solution and today successful open

00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:39,790
source companies are companies that

00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:42,009
integrate lots of things and so I would

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,709
categorize Google as a successful open

00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,889
source company because everything inside

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,089
their boundary is open-source but

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:54,100
nothing they deliver to their customer

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:55,720
is open-source and I think that the way

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,660
that bit that open source companies will

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,749
differentiate in this next decade is by

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,600
the management of complexity one of my

00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:06,279
favorite companies is cloudBees trapeze

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,569
works on a project that was at Sun

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,379
called

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:14,050
Jenkins and you could think of cloudBees

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,389
as a Jenkins company but really they're

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,699
not they're really a management of

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,309
complexity company that delivers

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:23,709
developer solutions using a stack of

00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:26,470
open source software of which Jenkins is

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:30,129
one of the parts and I think that's

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,709
characteristic of the next decades open

00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:37,389
source companies they will be managing

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:40,809
complexity for their clients I think

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:42,850
that in the future we'll see also it is

00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:45,220
deployers that are driving project life

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,509
cycles in the previous two decades of

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,490
open-source it was the delivery

00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:52,329
priorities of the developers that drove

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,220
open source life cycles but I think that

00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,959
in the next decade it will be deployers

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,540
that are driving project life cycles and

00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,269
that's why I expect to see a release

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,129
train model becoming more and more than

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,709
norm it's already pretty much the norm

00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,839
in the projects I look at I don't think

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,610
we will see very many people tolerating

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,639
a when it's ready model for delivery

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,170
anymore because as a deployer you want

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,999
to know what the release dates are for

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,600
your stack and you preferably want them

00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:22,889
to all be predictable and aligned that's

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,709
one of the reasons Linux succeeded for

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:29,980
the the enterprise infrastructure stack

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,749
it was because you knew when everything

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,249
was going to be ready and you knew how

00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:35,560
is all going to be deployed it was it

00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:37,570
was all very predictable

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,190
I think that from an open-source

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,410
perspective we're going to see licensing

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,350
consolidation continue to advance I

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,270
don't think we want your new open-source

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,750
licenses thank you please don't write

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:52,330
any new ones because OSI is going to

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,250
give you hell if you do you better have

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,279
a really really good reason why you're

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,100
submitting a new license to us because

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,890
we will very politely tell you exactly

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,300
how much you're valued when you show up

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,610
on the license review list with your

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,980
license now there are a few exceptions

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,960
to that we we welcome and the new

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,360
Eclipse license for example because it

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,130
fixes the old Eclipse license we're

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,320
quite happy to have people fix old

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,910
licenses especially if they deprecated

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,900
the old ones rather than just keep them

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:25,089
for old times sake I think that we're

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,970
going to see compatibility families of

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,440
Licensing dominate so I don't think it's

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,360
going to matter very much which license

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,890
you pick but it is going to matter that

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,170
it's compatible with the family of

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,600
licenses that you're deploys using their

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,390
stack so if you're the stack that's

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,180
being deployed as a GPL stack really you

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,250
need to use a GPL compatible license

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,280
novelty is of no interest because what

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,110
matters is that me managing the

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,120
compliance of my stack is going to be

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,460
far more important than the license

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,260
preferences that you had so I think

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,060
compatibility families will dominate

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,040
licensing I think we're going to

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:04,150
discover a new enemy and it is

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,110
attribution the enemy up until now has

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,870
not been attribution it is it has been

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:14,350
reciprocity everybody has been afraid of

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,480
the GPL the reason everyone is afraid of

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,370
the GPL is their corporate counsel has

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,500
told them that the developers will

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,800
accidentally give away all the company's

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,709
IP and they can't be allowed anywhere

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,240
near that dangerous GPL thing that is

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,360
going to give away all the company's IP

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,070
so just don't allow it but it turns out

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,790
open-source licenses have requirements

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,580
other than reciprocity by reciprocity I

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,740
mean copyleft they have terms other than

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,040
reciprocity the most important one is

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:49,120
attribution so for example the BSD

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,640
license seems so simple and yet it says

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,050
that you have to give attribution you

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,150
have to reproduce the copyright

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,520
statement and disclaimer of the BSD

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,520
license as modified by each individual

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,370
geek in the documentation for whatever

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,320
you ship to your customers

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,860
now satisfying that attribution

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:12,580
requirement is a very unpleasant

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:15,370
engineering task tracking the exact

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,630
generation of each line of code in your

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,020
product and making sure there is

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,750
attribution for it is a terrible task go

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,000
look in iTunes and go look for the about

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,880
area and go look in the licensing

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,090
section and you will see page after page

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,330
after page after page of slightly

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,330
different bsd MIT ISC and apache

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,510
licenses going past for every line of

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,490
code that they've incorporated in itunes

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,400
and i believe that we've come to terms

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,090
with reciprocity we know how to manage

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,730
GPL now it is a very simple task to

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,830
manage GPL in your product particularly

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,710
if your product is not being shipped to

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,470
anybody but maintaining attribution is a

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,870
nightmare it is a terrible thing to have

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,030
to do and I think we will see people

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,860
begin to say oh we're using the GPL

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:11,429
because of the compliance issues with

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,990
the BSD license you heard it here first

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:18,000
and as I say we're not going to approve

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,000
any new licenses so please don't try and

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,559
I will if you want later I'll explain to

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,809
you the mechanisms we're going to use to

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,429
stop you writing new licenses but that's

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:32,830
what they are and then now it turns out

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:36,850
that software freedom was what

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:39,640
open-source was always about I was

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,800
reading some of the reasons RMS doesn't

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,070
like the term open source and he said

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,360
it's because we never talk about freedom

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,920
well I'd like to correct that

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,880
misapprehension Richard if you're

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,270
watching we do talk about freedom all

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,330
the time software freedom is very

00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:01,150
important to human beings and it is the

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,740
goal of open-source is to make sure that

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,110
freedom is available to us

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,179
the human beings as possible and we have

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,460
cunningly exploited a weakness in

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,530
corporations to make sure that software

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,309
freedom is available to everyone on the

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,840
planet for huge amounts of software but

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,910
it turns out that software freedom is

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,760
the most important thing software

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:26,110
open-source is not just a methodology it

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,050
is a way of having the lowest friction

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:32,470
lowest impact way of ensuring software

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,510
freedom if you take the approach of

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,900
software freedom being a personal choice

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,240
like FSF does you have to evaluate every

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,490
license and every program to check its

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,890
software freedom profile and because

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,740
that's a hard task you have to empower

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,380
an individual to tell you whether or not

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,540
this is free software but the

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,090
open-source approach is to leave it to

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,160
consensus it's to leave it to the

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,980
community consensus to say whether this

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,510
is free software and is to remember the

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:07,090
consensus to attach the consensus to the

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,070
license and then to give people the

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,910
confidence to innovate without needing

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,830
to ask permission first

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,360
those core freedoms however matter if

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,730
you didn't have the freedom to use the

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,350
software for any purpose you would have

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,320
to ask for permission to use the

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,050
software and you could not innovate if

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,760
you did not have the freedom to review

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,080
the source code of the software you

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,059
would have to ask for it you would have

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,340
to gain permission and you would

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:36,490
consequently not be free to innovate and

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,410
to deploy and to change if you had to

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,870
ask for permission to pass the software

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,670
on to other people then you would not be

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,070
free to innovate you would not be free

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,410
to build community you would not be free

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,350
to build to have diverse communities of

00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,870
deployment and use all the things you

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,200
value about open-source flow from those

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:59,260
core 4 freedoms and if you didn't have

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,360
them then all of those methodological

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,000
ideas about open source would never

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,670
apply and I think we're going to

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,440
rediscover that during this decade

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,840
because those core freedoms drive

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,880
business values and they unify

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,559
engagement so that people can

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,960
collaborate in a community without

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,490
having to fear the

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,820
collaborators software freedom delivers

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,620
better results and that's why if you're

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,250
cops that's why if you're coming up with

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,080
a strategy and you're trying to work out

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,710
what you should do in your strategy I

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:39,120
recommend you as a human apply software

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:41,130
freedom first as your first guess do the

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,580
thing that creates more software freedom

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,200
and then look around to see whether

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,480
that's the right business solution and

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,820
you'll find in almost every case that

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,820
opting for software freedom get gives

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,770
you the best first guess for a business

00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,970
decision

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,830
too many people make a business decision

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,870
and then try to fit the software freedom

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:08,910
later and trust me that often fails and

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,460
then in the next decade I would say this

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,490
because they are paying for my travel

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,990
OSI is more relevant than ever I'd

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,780
encourage you to become individual

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,690
members of OSI in this our 20th

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,870
anniversary year we are continuing to

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,120
engage in license stewardship during the

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,420
first decade of open-source that was oh

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,130
I wonder how we do license stewardship

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,620
during the second decade it was bring

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,600
your licenses we want them and in the

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:41,370
third decade it is no more licenses

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,140
please we have plenty more importantly I

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,300
think the license stewardship which I

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,090
think you understand is bridging

00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,910
communities we bridge open source

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,060
communities we bridge every open source

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,620
community we go out drinking with the

00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,700
leaders of open source communities don't

00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:01,860
we Cedric we make sure that everybody

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,160
knows everybody else and that the

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,870
opportunity for disunity is as small as

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,290
possible

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:14,190
it's a quiet role and it requires you to

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,230
have a strong liver but it is very very

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,950
important to the future of open-source

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:22,380
and we'll carry on confirming recording

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,970
and protecting consensus sometimes in

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,640
new areas we'll be doing this around new

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,860
projects within our size incubator

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,260
if you've got a new idea about something

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,059
that doesn't involve writing code maybe

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,309
it's a travel fund for independent

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,460
developers maybe it is a new

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:45,090
international magazine for developers

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:47,970
maybe it is an academic curriculum for

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,910
open-source if you've got a non code

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,280
idea we would like to host it we would

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,750
like to confirm the consensus of the

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,940
group of people you have working on it

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,070
record that consensus and make it

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,860
available to others and then protect it

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,400
from abuse because we discovered that

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:09,500
consensus is valuable so we're coming

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:16,710
into the third decade now of open-source

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:20,010
and I see a bright future I see a this

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:23,160
is this is a moon rise which I still

00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:27,780
love I think we're seeing a new day

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:31,500
dawning and remember that the new day

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,809
starts at the end of the old day the new

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,900
day starts on February the second next

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,330
year and the old day is currently in

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,770
progress so thank you very much for

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,350
listening and I wish you a very

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,150
profitable and enjoyable third decade of

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:53,249
open-source

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:53,249
