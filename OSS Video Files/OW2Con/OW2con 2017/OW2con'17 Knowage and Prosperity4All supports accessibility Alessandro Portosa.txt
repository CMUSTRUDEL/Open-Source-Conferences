Title: OW2con'17 Knowage and Prosperity4All supports accessibility Alessandro Portosa
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	The European research project Prosperity4all focuses on developing the infrastructure to allow a new ecosystem to grow; one that is based on self-rewarding collaboration, that can reduce redundant development, set lower costs, increase market reach and penetration internationally, and create the robust cross-platform spectrum of mainstream and assistive technology-based solutions. 

P4All is part of a wider initiative for the creation of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), a paradigm shift in eInclusion through one-size-fits-one digitally inclusive solutions.

The presentation focus on the activities performed in the P4All project to evolve the Knowage OW2 BI platform adding accessibility features to allow access to business intelligence data for users with different type of disabilities. 

The main integration consists in:
- ARIA and mouseless navigation support
- Fluid Infusion: Preferences Framework to allow users with visual impairments to adapt KnowAge interfaces based on their needs.
- Robobraille: a conversion tool to generate BI data as accessible PDF (and other formats) optimized for assistive devices

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,400
Thank You one I'm Sandra Sosa and

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,719
technical servant for engineering and

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,119
I'm part of the team of the you know HDI

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,380
solution that my colleague Stefan

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,920
already showed previously and today I

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,019
will talk with you about not

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,990
specifically not only knowledge but

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,300
specifically about how knowledge and

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,910
prosecutors for all support

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,760
accessibility so basically our

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:46,020
experience in the in the involvement on

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,420
this this European project so let me

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,800
give you just I mean brief introduction

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,920
about prosperity for all

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,350
for those of you that don't know which

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,420
kind of project is European project

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,719
focus on developing the infrastructure

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,609
to allow a new ecosystem to grow and

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,609
basically they are trying to build

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:13,250
doctor to build an ecosystem that the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,490
facilities the the developer to build

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,729
system that are accessible to everyone

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,900
so the most important objective are say

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:28,280
the nerd is a resident redundant

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,700
development and to do so they are

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,520
developing developer space and and in

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,079
this context we are we've been involved

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,470
as a we are involved in a tester and

00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,229
integrator and the one of the objective

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,290
is to set lower cost and also of course

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,909
to provide technology solution to

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,509
increase the market penetration and

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,509
create a cross-platform

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:05,509
set of machine technology so large

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:10,050
solution Stefan already will explain the

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,430
Spago bi and wedge immigration and this

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,280
immigration in this negation is also

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:20,140
the accessibility of our product as it

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,209
is is involved so in Spokeo bi also

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,299
because we changed the also because of

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:28,599
the technology swiss shift that we that

00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:30,340
we we made and also because we change

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,510
the we ever think the idea of

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,879
accessibility in our solution so the

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,560
main changes in the technology field in

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,989
the accessibility field are the

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,669
technology shift from XJS to angularjs

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:50,709
and these gave us apart the better

00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:54,419
interface and user experience also the

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:58,049
possibility to use a more modern way to

00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:05,290
to integrate simplicity the

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:09,419
accessibility so we use tags that makes

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,790
the product more accessible to to

00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:17,650
automatic reader and specifically reader

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:22,000
to to provide a better access to to the

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:25,510
products itself and also as i said the

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,239
the were different in be how we think

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,750
the how we think about the accessibility

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,849
in our product so in this case the

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,519
accessibility with no age became an

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:40,120
added value it was an added value and

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:44,620
also in spec VI but we rethink the way

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,019
in which this is an added value and if

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,449
the sex ability has been added to the

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,199
core product and differently from Spago

00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:56,319
bi where we used to have a different set

00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:00,159
of technologies that to enable the

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,669
accessibility in this image we rethink

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,340
this this approach we think that the

00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:09,790
accessibility shouldn't be something

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,489
that comes from a different set for

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,620
different people but of course this is

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,549
the work was the wrong way to think

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,979
about it so we we moved from having a

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:24,310
different set of tool specific different

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,639
set of tool to integrate in the common

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,590
standard set of

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:34,219
bi solute bi technologies and solutions

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:38,389
way a feature to exploit the analysis

00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:42,430
also for user that needs the type of

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:47,060
special needs in of course this required

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:52,449
some some rework on on the product due

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:57,849
to this this new new idea of developing

00:04:52,449 --> 00:05:00,740
so no age I said even integrator and

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:05,599
faster for for the prosperity for

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:09,580
project and we took the technology from

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:14,569
the developer space so we basically add

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,969
three main track of development that are

00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,550
the user interface option through the

00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:23,120
fluid infusion and the rubber bride

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,240
integration in which to export analysis

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,800
in an exportable in an accessible PDF

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,770
format and also we enhanced the iris

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,490
support in the mouth less navigation so

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:41,870
and for for this task actually we we

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,990
didn't find any solution yet indie

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:51,439
developer space so we we we did some

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:55,210
work by by ourself to enable user to

00:05:51,439 --> 00:06:00,889
explode or exploit also geographical

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:05,029
analysis and charts and be able to

00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:07,879
access to to the data behind it so for

00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:10,550
example for instance this is the user

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,919
interface options which is something

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,580
that you can find in the buffer space of

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,729
prosperity for project and that you can

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:24,169
integrate in in in your product as well

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,689
so as you can see you know on the top

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:29,990
you can you can see the shore display

00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,990
preference and this gave us the

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,259
possibility to meet some change

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,030
relevance change on the front-end

00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:42,840
front-end interface so for instance he

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,230
here we decided to change the contrast

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,710
of the of the of the user interface or

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:54,870
you can say you can maybe use a blind

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:59,370
save set of color or you can play with

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:03,270
the line spacing and and so on so at the

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,420
time we we didn't implement all the user

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,650
interface option feature but we are

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,650
going to do to do that

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,260
another feature and another development

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,720
in this context has been achieved

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,530
through the rubber rubber brightest

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,540
service rubber bride is a service that

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:29,400
is also involved in the project that

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,770
provides services that can be code to

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,220
get data dattara

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:39,570
acts more accessible and more readable

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:45,200
from specific readers and in this case

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:49,370
we integrated it to export analysis and

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,670
in exceed all format specifically we

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:56,940
call the services the true bright robot

00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,390
provides and we get the accessible PDF

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:05,000
that then can be can be read later with

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,000
the specific readers or in another way

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,280
the last one is the Aria support so and

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,230
the mouse des navigation with as I said

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,800
before the technologies with a shift

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:23,790
from the from the XJS framework to

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,130
angular JS gave us the opportunity we

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,970
took the opportunity this opportunity to

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:33,440
also to enhance the the accessibility so

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:38,060
while we were building the new interface

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:43,260
instead of just use the angular without

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:46,230
without take advantage of the area we we

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:51,270
took it we take we use the Eiger support

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,120
so this enables your interface to be

00:08:51,270 --> 00:09:00,079
more readable from

00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:03,110
from from screenreader and also we we

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:06,470
integrate in the location intelligence

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:10,339
analysis the possibility to read the

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,939
data behind the be ended analysis of of

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:18,589
course is not was not possible to make

00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:21,069
to make the entire map readable so the

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,439
the first step that we need was to

00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:27,589
enable the data behind the map this for

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,959
the the data the deductr that contains

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:33,410
the business information in business

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:40,790
data to be actually readable directly

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:44,569
from from the rival from the browser so

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,809
which is our experience as a tester in

00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:54,050
the integrator in the developer space

00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:57,350
and as prosperity for all user as a as I

00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:01,759
said the robber space is a space to word

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:04,490
where you can find a technology solution

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:08,720
that you can implement in your in your

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,809
application and they are designed this

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,639
technology are growing and in DINO each

00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,999
community edition which has just been

00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,579
released few days ago includes the user

00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:22,040
interface options that we see before the

00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:26,480
Aria support and the Robo bra

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,209
integration we are going to engineering

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,100
plans to improve and extend the user

00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:34,189
interface option of course include all

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,309
the features not only de set de tavera

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:40,970
simply implemented and also we are going

00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:44,240
to to to improve the Robo Braille

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:48,740
integration to extend the set of format

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,629
so we want to also to to export the data

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:57,139
in uniform at it can be reasonable and

00:10:52,629 --> 00:11:00,139
so that other people can access can can

00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,350
use or can exploit this kind of format

00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:05,310
for the information itself and the most

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,870
important thing is

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:15,150
I believe is that we moved from a

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:18,630
solution that enable accessibility by by

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:21,720
dividing the de features available and

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,710
to a solution in no age where we have

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,860
only one solution so we don't have extra

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,460
engines

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,130
we don't have acted like like we used to

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,710
say in study I and accessibility axial

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,310
accessible engine but we have also the

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:42,540
common engine and the accessibility is X

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,820
pixel is a is offered through the

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,430
different feature and different function

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,140
that are implemented in the in the

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,140
English solution in bi solution itself

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:58,989
Thank You Alexandra
