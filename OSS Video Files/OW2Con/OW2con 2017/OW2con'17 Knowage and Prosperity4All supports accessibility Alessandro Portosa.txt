Description: 
	The European research project Prosperity4all focuses on developing the infrastructure to allow a new ecosystem to grow; one that is based on self-rewarding collaboration, that can reduce redundant development, set lower costs, increase market reach and penetration internationally, and create the robust cross-platform spectrum of mainstream and assistive technology-based solutions. 

P4All is part of a wider initiative for the creation of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), a paradigm shift in eInclusion through one-size-fits-one digitally inclusive solutions.

The presentation focus on the activities performed in the P4All project to evolve the Knowage OW2 BI platform adding accessibility features to allow access to business intelligence data for users with different type of disabilities. 

The main integration consists in:
- ARIA and mouseless navigation support
- Fluid Infusion: Preferences Framework to allow users with visual impairments to adapt KnowAge interfaces based on their needs.
- Robobraille: a conversion tool to generate BI data as accessible PDF (and other formats) optimized for assistive devices
