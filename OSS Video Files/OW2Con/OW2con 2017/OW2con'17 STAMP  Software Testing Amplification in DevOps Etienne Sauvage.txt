Title: OW2con'17 STAMP  Software Testing Amplification in DevOps Etienne Sauvage

Description: 
	DevOps strongly encourages the development of test suites and test scripts that can run automatically at every build in order to detect regressions as soon as possible. However, the manual development of strong test suites is extremely time consuming. In this talk I will introduce test amplification, as an original solution to address this pain point. This approach consists in leveraging existing test cases and scripts in order to produce new ones through automatic transformation processes. I will present initial results about unit test amplification, from the STAMP project.
