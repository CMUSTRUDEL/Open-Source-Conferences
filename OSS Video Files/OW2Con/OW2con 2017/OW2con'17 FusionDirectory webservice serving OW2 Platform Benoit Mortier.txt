Description: 
	OW2 is an independent, global, open-source software community. The mission of OW2 is to a) promote the development of open-source middleware, generic business applications, cloud computing platforms and b) foster a vibrant community and business ecosystem. 
OW2 developments follow a flexible, component-based approach. These components range from specific software frameworks, protocols and applications through to integrated, service-oriented platforms for enterprise computing. 
Our mission was to make an audit on the existing LDAP Directory, to review schemas and data modeling, to develop a plugin for community management and community projects and eventually, to do an intensive testing and correction of the webservice.

OW2 wanted to reorganize all its IT infrastructure. They were facing a major issues : users data were distributed in a database and an ldap directory, thus no single source of identification and authentication. Management was difficult and did not allow an easy access to data.

Thank to FusionDirectory, a flexible web application able adapt to existing applications rather than interferring with them, and particularly through its Webservice, OW2 is now able to:

- create users through FusionDirectory
- reset password from xwiki through FusionDirectory
- account recovery from xwiki through FusionDirectory
- easier account management for ow2 staff
