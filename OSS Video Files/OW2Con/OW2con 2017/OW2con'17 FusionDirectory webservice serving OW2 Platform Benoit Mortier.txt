Title: OW2con'17 FusionDirectory webservice serving OW2 Platform Benoit Mortier
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	OW2 is an independent, global, open-source software community. The mission of OW2 is to a) promote the development of open-source middleware, generic business applications, cloud computing platforms and b) foster a vibrant community and business ecosystem. 
OW2 developments follow a flexible, component-based approach. These components range from specific software frameworks, protocols and applications through to integrated, service-oriented platforms for enterprise computing. 
Our mission was to make an audit on the existing LDAP Directory, to review schemas and data modeling, to develop a plugin for community management and community projects and eventually, to do an intensive testing and correction of the webservice.

OW2 wanted to reorganize all its IT infrastructure. They were facing a major issues : users data were distributed in a database and an ldap directory, thus no single source of identification and authentication. Management was difficult and did not allow an easy access to data.

Thank to FusionDirectory, a flexible web application able adapt to existing applications rather than interferring with them, and particularly through its Webservice, OW2 is now able to:

- create users through FusionDirectory
- reset password from xwiki through FusionDirectory
- account recovery from xwiki through FusionDirectory
- easier account management for ow2 staff

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:13,349
nope Bhanumati from open site we

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:18,090
specialize in identity management and we

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:21,810
also publish fries and a toy a tool to

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,050
manage your LDAP server and in this

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,500
short presentation we will talk about oh

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,050
we have used that to improve the

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:37,530
management of the law we do

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:39,739
infrastructure so that little clan I

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,390
will talk about the infrastructure

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,239
history new infrastructure of

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,670
accomplishment and what we want to do in

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,899
the future

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:55,500
so a dot like many organization or we do

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,230
has a lot of application to to manage

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,079
lots of account to manage lots of people

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,960
to manage lots of project so they have

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,830
all those kind of application that

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,159
should connect to some source of

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:14,250
residential to let people go in so you

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,490
can see you have g46 bikini keys bamboo

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,700
and fisheye are replaced by get lab CI

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,430
then gr sim pass on our facility and

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,350
OpenStack I don't know OpenStack connect

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:32,610
today but that should be interesting so

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:36,990
in the past history like most of place

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,229
it was a mix of database and stuff so

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,079
they have each wiki website because it's

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,710
Vicky is the center of nearly everything

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,759
around users and and web page and

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,820
everything in Hubli - so at start people

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,969
were registering to the each wiki

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,420
website to the magical database through

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:04,049
PHP script and people were using

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,899
phpMyAdmin to make user management

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,300
that's really awful because when you

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,459
know PHP my admin to change your

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,890
database by end to change user

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,020
credential and stuff like that it's

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,110
really difficult and you cannot give

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,830
that to to some people not knowing how

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
to do it

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,890
and the user database was then

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,870
synchronized to an LDAP server where

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,840
some of the application we are getting

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,660
the credential and of course the

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,200
classical topic you will having some

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,620
data about user in this medical database

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,920
some data on this LDAP server and maybe

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,990
some other stuff somewhere else so when

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,930
you want to sum something you have to go

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,600
to the database to discover and to your

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,550
other application that have local

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,430
accounts so it's very difficult not to

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,400
miss something it's very difficult to

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,209
detective 8-1 accounts really fast and

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,209
other ways you can say that six months

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,950
after trying to remove something but

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,570
it's still there because nobody knows

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,360
that oh there is an application

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,850
somewhere where yet there's still that I

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:22,489
was password and stuff like that

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:26,930
that's really a difficult topic so in

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:30,030
2016 we meet with the video guys and

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,630
they were looking at some tools to

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,480
manage the world infrastructure from one

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,600
interface and only one and then we

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,450
discuss and then they agreed to use a

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:47,430
hidden directory for that and for that

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:51,720
one of the biggest work at first was to

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,049
map the actual data from a way to tune

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,180
LDAP server for that

00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:00,090
Clemmie was doing most of the work

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,080
because before we came into the picture

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:08,190
and then we complete it with the help of

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:12,900
Martin and then after that the challenge

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:16,680
is to map correctly the business way of

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,560
working to the tour and to make it

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,310
useful for people trying to use it but

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,560
you don't have to change the tool to

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,120
make it work for this particular case so

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,090
the real difficulties

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,720
most of the challenge is to map the data

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,840
and still have the tool you use useful

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,169
for everybody so you can have a tool and

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,060
the tool can evolve and everything you

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,310
don't have to do redo the same stuff

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,060
year after year after year

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,720
so some plug-in were made specifically

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,199
poor for the oh we do infrastructure

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,800
that goes inside the season right right

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,860
project so that's just to show you a

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,610
little bit of the interface everything

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,880
is in total here but it's a web software

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,780
with a plugin system so you can install

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,990
only the part you need on this on the

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,050
one from a way to you have only user

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,760
groups role community newsletter and

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:27,150
that's all mainly and then that's from

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,910
the user point of view not some of the

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,820
nice functionality effectively you can

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,660
create user group roles we can create

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,220
functional mail Aaliyah's you have

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,100
classical password management or P

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,229
policy management if you want you as the

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,810
observer to do the the password

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,930
management user template the one

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,169
functionality that every active

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,270
directory system administrator wants

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,820
directly I can have templates to make my

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,250
user I don't have to click 10 times in a

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,979
row no you can have templates and then

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,039
create user from template bulk import

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,310
copy paste snapshot subset is really

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,180
useful it's you can create an instant

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,760
copy of your object store it into the

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,580
LDAP make a modification and restore

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,729
your object so you have some kind of oh

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,430
I've made a mistake I have to restore my

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,039
object click restore you have your

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,380
object back so that's very very happily

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:33,210
because it has tons and tons of

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:37,919
functionality functional just usage so

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:40,610
the accomplishment as of today user and

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,030
project are inside the LDAP server

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:49,050
the registration of new user is done

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:52,710
classically 2.x wiki but it's taught to

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,639
the physical web services and create the

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,460
user through phonetically into the LDAP

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,090
so further for the user hits transplant

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,370
they don't see anything most of the

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,729
application are connected to the lw8

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,159
right now so it means you have only one

00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:15,270
password user and password for most of

00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:18,569
them then you have a way for user to

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,789
modify their own data and the

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,650
modification goes directly through the

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,830
web service to the LDAP server so you

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,190
have people can manage some of them data

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,099
and of course for the management team

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,039
they have only one interface to manage

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:38,250
everything so that's a real bonus you

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,740
have to just manage user in one place

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,610
and you can modify the activate activate

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:48,300
directly from one interface and that's

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,759
just a page on web services because it's

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,909
used more and more because people

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,339
sometimes don't want to use the prison

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,550
director interface and they want to use

00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,370
their own tool to provision the LDAP

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,069
server body in the old way people were

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,460
making script and everything that could

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,169
break in wearable ways because they want

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,990
to provision so it they write themselves

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,690
or I will do it myself and I will write

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,599
stuff and it will push directly to my

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,719
LDAP server but most of the time you can

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,240
have crash non valid information and

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,300
stuff like that so the ID is that the

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,960
web services create the object like it

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,110
does if you go to the interface we have

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,959
a world system of SEL that's not

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,029
depending on your web server but from

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,969
the application itself from further than

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:45,540
PI itself so you can restrict what

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,810
people can do then you have models work

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,540
models and templates works through the

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,010
web services so you can say ok create

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,990
more create

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,290
participant this type through the web

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,930
services and just it will fill and then

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:05,230
it's it's very buttock it's G's on a

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,040
physical so anybody with some basic

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,970
knowledge can write page to create stuff

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,420
directly with the web services and then

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,560
in the future extend everything Tour de

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,950
Nesle like Clemmie said put an M luminal

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,130
Deb in front so you will log only once

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:31,090
fill Angelica we already support several

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:34,210
SSO services lumen LDAP gas classical

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,210
HTTP other and stuff like that

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,130
move more of the infrastructure inside

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,320
feeds on directory because feed on

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,900
director is not only to manage user

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:49,720
groups and stuff like that maybe we can

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:51,580
manage DNS DHCP mail SSH sudo so you can

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,130
manage the wall infrastructure from one

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,540
point and then you have the role

00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:03,280
formalization and usage that's not there

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,700
is no formalization no rule for that so

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,400
filling directory helps you to formalize

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,400
roles mostly we use that with web

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,770
application have an editor role and then

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,180
we cut the hole and have your hole and

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:21,700
stuff like that but most of the time the

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,020
issue is that its application specific

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:29,290
so most of the application I will say

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:32,230
more than 50% of awful LDAP connector

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,740
even in paid version because they were

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,900
made only to manage groups so they

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,660
manage project ropes they manage group

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,570
of name groups classical activate the

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,990
hectare groups but they are fixed filter

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:50,590
it's broken so most of the work we have

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,840
to do is go to those project if they are

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,060
open-source we can tell them ok your

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,760
connector has broken in his apart

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,310
please fix your connector we have done

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,580
that for several software already but if

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,560
you are in the proprietary world it's

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,400
very difficult to discuss with the guy

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,000
saying ok

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,300
it's broken no yes no yes and then you

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,390
can go like that for yes and then that's

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:21,250
less than tens we hope to be able to fix

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:23,080
those kind of issues there has some way

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,700
of doing it but it will not be

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,850
automatically and that's the important

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,839
URL when you can demoed the software

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:38,620
look at the software Estella downloaded

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,770
to install it and my contact are in the

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,600
bottom that's all for me

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:50,299
