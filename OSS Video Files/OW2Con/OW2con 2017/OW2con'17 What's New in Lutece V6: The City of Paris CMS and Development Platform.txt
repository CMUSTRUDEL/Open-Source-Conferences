00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,120
hello everyone I'm John I'm a programmer

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,480
working for the city of Paris and today

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,070
I will talk about Lou Thesz the

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,699
development platform by the city of

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,130
Paris and the new features and

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,960
highlights of the upcoming release

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:30,300
looters version 6 ok first let's start

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,969
with a bit of history

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,719
the project started the Lu test project

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:41,250
started in 2002 15 years ago when the

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,059
city of Paris needed a software to run

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:49,770
the 20 websites for its 20 districts and

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:51,510
it needed a publishing software and the

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,559
software app was made to answer this

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:00,510
need was released as free software with

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,879
a BSD license in 2002 this was actually

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,890
a big deal because it was the first

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,979
public organization in France to open in

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,140
source code and we know that there are a

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,880
lot of questions regarding software and

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
code that's written for public

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,930
organizations so this was an attempt to

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,759
answer those questions since 2002 the

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,890
city of Paris has continued its

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,670
involvement with open source and free

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:31,640
software it participated in many events

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,060
like Bali kpw open wall forum etc and in

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,740
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,950
it was there at the audible YouTube gone

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,570
in 2015 the city of Paris joined the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,329
other value 2 consortium as an

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,030
enterprise member and in 2016

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,720
loot s became an ability to make mature

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,570
project so please visit the loo test

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,729
page on the audible v2 website the link

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,399
is here so now that we've seen the

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,149
history of the open source history of

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,469
the project

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,140
what is leutis or more precisely what

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,620
has loot has been has the different

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:17,389
steps of its evolution

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,879
in 2002 it was a basically a content

00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,739
management system that allowed it to the

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,469
out the city of Paris to run the 20

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:27,290
websites for the districts so we had

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:30,079
dynamic document models publishing

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,969
workflows or search engine newsletters a

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:36,459
forum and many features that you need

00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:41,719
for such websites as the year passed

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:44,810
more more of the of the applications

00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:48,169
used at the city of Paris were migrated

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,359
on the latest development platform so it

00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,150
became a full-fledged java enterprise

00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:56,480
portal where it integrated with

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,549
different IT systems at the city of

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,469
Paris and had custom business

00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,829
applications written for it and also

00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,769
authentication management today it's

00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,250
really become a development framework

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,590
where you have core services an API is a

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,480
large set of plugins that provide

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,169
functionality that you can use for

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,060
building pretty much anything it also

00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:24,079
features a code generator in case you

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,829
need it you can also use do tests

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:29,959
without writing your own code it's still

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:34,720
a set of ready to use plugins that you

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,720
can assemble to deliver complex services

00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:41,449
Lu test is being used at the city of

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:46,639
Paris today but it's also used by other

00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:49,909
cities and by the French government some

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:54,829
integrators will work on the test

00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,549
systems and will help you achieve what

00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:59,659
you want with them

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:03,709
I have talked about with this and

00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:07,219
described it as a as different with

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,340
different descriptions because at the

00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,109
essence glue test is about modularity

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,650
it's bait the system is based on a core

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:18,680
/ plugins architecture where everything

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:23,930
is a plug-in even the initial CMS that

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:26,060
provided documents is in the effort from

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,520
the technical point of view it's called

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,620
the plug-in document and the plug-in

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,210
HTML it allows you to publish content on

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,029
your website

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:39,130
it's got 500 plugins that provide

00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:43,400
features across a very large spectrum of

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:46,099
systems that you can need this is a

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,180
really important feature and this is

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:53,810
what has allowed us to work with leutis

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:58,310
we are a relatively small team and we've

00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:01,279
been running over 70 online procedures

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:07,930
online forms for the city of Paris over

00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:16,880
200 applications spanning 600 live

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:19,610
instances of glue tests in addition to

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,479
this modularity that that allows us to

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,000
go forward we build on the mature and

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,510
strong ecosystem around the java

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,440
programming language which has strengths

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:36,500
and weaknesses but we find that its

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,400
strengths are working good for us we use

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,949
maven to match our dependencies and our

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,880
use of our usage of maven is centered

00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:49,900
around a plugin that we wrote for maven

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,279
which is called the lootus maven plugin

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,270
which takes care of assembling usable

00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:02,240
web apps from pretty much any any

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:08,409
artifact that we write not just the

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,409
final war corresponding to the website

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:16,400
we we use

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,800
known tools to allow us to go forward so

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,539
for example our issue tracking is using

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:28,009
JIRA we use Jenkins for integration

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:32,510
testing and pulling code directly on a

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:35,690
comet from github and we use a sonarqube

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,740
to provide some useful metrics about

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:42,440
Cockrell

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:45,560
and we use a custom custom-made a system

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,940
to provide continuous delivery with

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,250
one-click deployments all the

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,730
informations from this these different

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,340
tools are also aggregated in one simple

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,370
tool that we wrote that's a custom tool

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,980
that shows the percentage of projects

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,470
that are following the guidelines coding

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:12,380
guideline the number of issues the

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:14,810
releases etc okay so now that we've seen

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:19,370
what Rita is let's talk a bit about the

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,940
version six and the highlights so Lou

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,420
Thesz version 6 will require Java 8 this

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:30,230
will help us get more and more of the

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:35,420
strong features the strengths of Java

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:39,140
and less less of the disadvantages all

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:42,200
others all other libraries depend how

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,419
the dependencies were upgraded so for

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,760
example for inversion of control we use

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,690
spring and we upgraded to the latest

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,750
version free marker template engine

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:56,870
loosen for search the HKH and jackson

00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:00,890
for you know you know what what they're

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,360
for apart from the upgraded dependencies

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:06,650
we have a few highlights for this

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,580
release we have a brand-new integration

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:15,050
of elastic search and kiba so this

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,680
allows you to use plugins to write your

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,460
data from the portal inside elastic

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,980
search and display pretty graphs in the

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,280
back office where you can manage

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,659
everything and this integration allows

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,440
you to coordinate the rules and the

00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:40,870
rights from the portal users to the

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,870
charts that you get from Cabana

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,460
a brand-new topic also with the front

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,080
cross connect integration hose connected

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,490
a system by the French government that

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:57,180
aims to reduce friction between the

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,950
users the French people and and all

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,040
their interaction with the public

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:07,620
organizations so it was it actually went

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:15,150
live on my own palace via the Parisian

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:18,420
account last week so you can now certify

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,640
your name and and other and other

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,150
attributes and you never have to

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
communicate them again if you are

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:30,030
interested in France connect you can

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,640
check out all these links they will show

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:39,840
you how we use for connecting with s how

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:42,750
you can use it different demos so I've

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,020
talked a bit about the new features for

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,830
dices but the best is for you to try it

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,500
yourself we have a darker image waiting

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,090
for you at on the docker hub or you can

00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,380
use the Web App Store that allows you to

00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:04,200
compose a portal using different plugins

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,330
for people who want to seek or code the

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,340
Artic hardcore coders you can check out

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:15,150
this animated gif showing how to compile

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,940
and package and run a simple root test

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:22,520
plug-in called the lutessa HelloWorld

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:26,010
plugin you can also visit the

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,380
documentation and resources there's a

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,630
lot of stuff on the audibility to site

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,450
and the forge also on the official

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:37,890
website in french if you if you can be

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,770
friends the demo site allows to see our

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,530
freshly built by the Jenkins server

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:48,390
version of the site with many many

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:54,980
plugins to to showcase the CMS and other

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:56,130
features and yeah the code is on github

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,740
split

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:04,530
to two different repositories one that

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:06,480
is one that uses a that is a technical

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,700
basis and provides many different

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,550
plugins and one that provides plugins

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:16,560
aimed for public organizations it's just

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:19,320
such as cities other highlights that I

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,510
haven't talked about for the blue test

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:28,140
version six release feature appointments

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,620
this is a very frequent need for cities

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,500
and organizations to be able to schedule

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,880
appointments with their citizens and

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:42,420
another new feature that's coming to

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:44,250
Paris is the kind of a CR CRM customer

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,170
relationship management plan but we'd

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,440
like to call it a citizen relationship

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:53,340
management plugin that allows you to

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,050
interact with your citizens thank you

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,630
for listening and we hope to hear from

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,630
