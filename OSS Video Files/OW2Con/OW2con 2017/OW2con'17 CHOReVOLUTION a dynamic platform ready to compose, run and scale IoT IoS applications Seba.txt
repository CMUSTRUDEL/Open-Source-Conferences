Description: 
	From Code to Product, from Myth to Reality, the CHOReVOLUTION project is achieving its goal by delivering a dynamic platform, during its third and last year. 
More precisely, the CHOReVOLUTION Studio for Eclipse is addressing scalable IoT/IoS applications based on choreography modelling, synthesis, adaptation, service bus, security, and cloud. It aims at integrating as much as possible existing web services to create new innovative solutions.
The first applications developed for evaluating the solution provided useful feedbacks allowing us to improve the solution in order to reach a first level of maturity.
The CHOReVOLUTION software are published under an open source licence and made publicly available through the OW2 community.
