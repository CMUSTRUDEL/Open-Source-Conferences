Description: 
	Open Source software projects have diverse goals, but they mainly have a mission in common: promote the adoption and collaboration of their specific products. They might have different reasons for it and different policies to achieve that vision. But it ends being about the people using and developing those products.

Talking about "success", in this case, it would mean that the products are used and developed by individuals or by the industry. How could we measure this success? Metrics are useful for project transparency, neutrality, marketing and engineering, and during this talk we will present some use cases and tools to manage your open source and collaborative software projects in an effective way.
