00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,990
hello so since we are talking about the

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,330
history about many things about Bill w-2

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,770
and this presentation is a little bit of

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,699
the history of rocket chat since we are

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,910
one of the latest members to join and

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,560
how it came to be so if anyone doesn't

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,590
know what rocket jet is is an open

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,689
source platform for chat sharing files

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,690
creating groups channels private

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:37,230
conversations video conference

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:42,239
everything build on JavaScript with MIT

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:45,030
license we first started creating rocket

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,250
chat because I have another company that

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,200
does CRM tool and some websites or

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,050
clients and they always keep asking us

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,850
to do one of those annoying pop-ups on

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,000
the website so they could talk to their

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,399
customers and we are trying to find

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,039
something open-source that you could use

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
they could integrate into our CRM and we

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,729
couldn't find something that was

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,939
flexible or was using the right

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,909
technology for real-time conversation

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,640
without being very heavy on the server

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,840
or was too messy to install the moving

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,150
parts to end up building one energy

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,350
decided it was so good that ok let's

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,479
make it open source

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,400
let's get other people to share and

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,890
point the fingers and everything that we

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
done wrong because we didn't have much

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,500
experience on building a real-time

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,329
application at that time and but what

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,460
happened is because nobody usually pays

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,820
you to put turn something to open-source

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,090
that's just stayed on our repository for

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,570
about half a year with nobody promoting

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,320
or giving a name writing a manual until

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,030
I received an email or for a firm it's a

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,040
meteor forum is the framework that you

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,509
use JavaScript and there's those brute

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,340
this group saying oh it would be awesome

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,670
if we build an open-source version of

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,890
slack and then we in the office work ok

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,200
we already built it it just forgot to

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,730
publish or it didn't get around to

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,319
actually give it a like show to people

00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,650
so we had some conversations if they

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,480
wanted

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,120
join our team help us or we help them

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,950
and then in the end they propose why

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,970
don't you do a friendly competition see

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,860
who can build the best is lack

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,390
open-source version of slack so I just

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,430
bought a lot of Red Bull and then I put

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,260
all the team in the you know in the

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,239
office and say ok nobody leaves until

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,609
this is out and we can show the world

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,640
something

00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:42,720
so then rocket Chad was born on that

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,730
night and on the next two days we were

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,599
featured in hacker news and product hunt

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:52,079
for all day this is the spike you can

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,109
see like the 28th is when we long to the

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:58,680
website and then it was like 30 hours

00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:01,139
later it was being downloaded everywhere

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,939
and just the part from melting our

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,470
servers like they were just crashing

00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,180
because everybody wanted to see the demo

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,480
and there was about thousands of

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,159
people's like logging in our demo server

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,290
but then the good thing is people were

00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,609
actually looking at the code and telling

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,920
us how you're doing this wrong maybe you

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,480
can optimize here we are seeing the

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,440
server melt so you could now now

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,739
definitely have the load to see what

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,049
we're doing wrong and but in that week

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,840
we became one of the trending projects

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,919
of that week and we stayed on github top

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,810
training projects for over a month and

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,519
then there was the stack share was

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,549
sending emails and talking about rocket

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,609
chairman Heroku put us on the on the

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:47,909
cover saying was none of the feature

00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:50,340
apps to do a one-click deploy and then

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,470
the whole the docker community created a

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,690
official image to put on their library

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,780
because so many people are asking to

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,120
have a easy way to deploy and then the

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,470
thing rocket almost got a life of its

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,389
own and then you got the guys from

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,659
github to do the electron helping us to

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,400
build a electron map for rocket share

00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,379
the desktop version so maybe put on

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,829
their website was built with electron

00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,629
and also have mobile developers starting

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,030
to contribute and build the mobile apps

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,570
so it was quite a journey

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,520
then something there was like nothing

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,990
happened for six months and then money

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,940
decided to

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,430
show and put it out there it just

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,910
completely changed my life and the life

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,560
of the whole the whole company got

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:40,110
translated to over now I think we have

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:43,380
45 languages we added the video video

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:48,630
capability using WebRTC and then we're

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,789
very engaging the go there github guys

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,919
we say now you guys have to now build

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:56,100
all the integrations and why don't you

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,139
use our robot driver so you build a

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,360
robot driver and internally then it's

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,229
called the rocket cats but it is

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,560
literally just a the robot source code

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:11,099
compiled inside our our platform so you

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,650
can actually rather than having to start

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,970
bot in a different server and then

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,000
connect to it you can still do that

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,880
obviously for many reasons you might

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,449
want to do that but for a simple script

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,759
you can just go to the admin area paste

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,960
the script and it will run that on a

00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:34,470
virtual virtual JavaScript machine and

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,830
then you have access to all the nodejs

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,680
libraries and then you can extend easily

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,680
extend your your capabilities of your

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,889
chat application is doing here are some

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,900
samples rapport building in a way that

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,020
inside the conversation you could ask

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,240
the bot to get a file so you could even

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,310
do a commit from inside the conversation

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,110
change a fire do a pull request from

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,970
directly inside the same UI so then

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,610
something there was quite organically we

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,520
just we started to realize that we were

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,030
building something more than we

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,409
initially anticipated we're kind of

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,310
thing they're rebuilding the wordpress

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:21,630
of chats and that was our vision for

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,580
awhile we start to see a lot of people

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,740
sending links where they were deploying

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,190
rocket chat from the Bernie Sanders

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:34,790
campaign to the dive bar or even these a

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:38,160
a b-1 which is the Brazilian NASA the

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,960
Space Agency Brazil and then even like

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,940
this end of the picture ones like that

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,949
you Rockets together and you starting by

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,830
the hyper ladder from the linen linen

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,870
foundation as lots of different

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,350
open-source projects starting to use

00:06:51,870 --> 00:07:00,180
rocket jet as as the tool for the

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:03,090
community to collaborate and discuss but

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,750
also like larger organizations like the

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,360
Dutch mom where they wanted to they

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,830
didn't want to have the slack because

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,110
they wanted to have all their

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,260
conversations from their teams on their

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,850
own data centers and then we work with

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,520
them to create a way that they could

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,789
quickly we build a tool called the

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,070
rocket launcher when they can deploy it

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,349
internally and have almost as a service

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,199
they could quickly create a team and

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,060
invite users and deploy for that

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,550
specific business unit or part of the

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,259
organization and that's now they have on

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,530
their catalogue of applications they can

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,060
deploy internally but we also worked

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,500
with a lot of companies that you

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,880
this is vitam as well we work to create

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,789
different services almost like white

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,150
labels version versions of rocket chat

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,190
with a specific purpose so just using

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,570
the platform and all the features they

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,919
already has and then building this extra

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,650
functionality on top on this one we

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,930
integrated with for them waste we do so

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:11,789
and with German artificial intelligence

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,639
processor another natural language

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,849
processor so people traveling on

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,080
Deutsche Bahn rail their customers could

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,090
text a number it would go inside rocket

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,330
jet that will pipe that message to the

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:30,630
artificial intelligence get the day

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:35,580
intent and then use that an object to

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:39,450
search on their schedule database on

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,880
Google on TripAdvisor and many many

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,350
other data sources and then produce a

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,740
five replies that the

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,600
the air support team would could use

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,440
they could then just click in one of

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,060
them who pre-populate the the tax field

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,610
and they could if they press send

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,750
it was send back the information using

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,550
the same gate the same streaming where

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,019
the message came from so if someone send

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,449
a message from inside the app it could

00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:12,560
reply thread inside the app be someone

00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:14,839
send an SMS rocket chat would know that

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,209
he needs to send back as an SMS it was a

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,519
email that came to a channel then we

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,350
reply back of an email so it just became

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,440
their single point of contact and

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,720
reduced their response time for it was

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,339
kind of like 10 minutes because there

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,540
was a long long way before and

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,449
everything was done manually on the

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,389
prototype to like under 30 seconds for

00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:38,620
people to have a meaningful reply

00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:44,509
revised by a real person and not just

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:48,139
not just a tronic reply and then have

00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:49,819
customers we build this one is configure

00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:52,790
what where channels are called

00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,740
classrooms and this is for specific for

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,069
university so there's a startup in in

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,649
u.s. the build is specific like

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:04,100
reshaping the whole UI thinking about

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:07,399
students and and teachers and each

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,670
classes and matters we build another one

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,310
for this is a stock structure Buddhist

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,339
is a trade company I think is Sweden and

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,120
then all the conversation every time it

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:23,089
talks about a company or specific in

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,250
stock the bots will show you graphics or

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,220
give you options what to do so it kind

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,899
of the bot gets into the conversation

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,550
but not just on the streaming of

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,589
conversation you have the whole panel on

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,260
the right that he could build on top of

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,630
raqqa chat to show more information and

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,220
give

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,680
actually do a service on top of the

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,410
conversation this one is specifically

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,899
for for hospitals it was featured in

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,480
TechCrunch Disrupt the guys from my

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,370
Combinator and this is specifically for

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,699
hospital then they turn each channels

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,800
became patient

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,120
so whenever so a new patient got into

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,949
the into the house

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,449
they would receive like a patient number

00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:05,959
that'll create a channel with

00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:09,439
automatically invite the doctor and all

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,709
the the machines that we do the exams

00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:16,040
x-ray and they would post the results

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,689
back to that channel so the the doctor

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,249
would be in the channel and if one or

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,660
two doctors are in the same can of that

00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,670
patient you'll receive everything in

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,269
real time you could also already comment

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:28,069
straightaway on the result discuss it so

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,050
they create a whole company that's based

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,120
on on a rocket jet of the platform and

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,139
then they customize for a specific

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,420
industry and then that's how for a while

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:40,519
you're maintaining the company doing

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,309
this feature development wide labeling

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,110
and doing doing integrations and that's

00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,480
something that we still do and still

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,040
something that we can talk about if you

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,660
have an idea for a specific injuries

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,069
that you want to work then I we kept

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,870
going to events talking about rockets ad

00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:02,059
building building a community inviting

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,240
to the keynote of opening in Austin in

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,420
London with mark and that started to

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,120
call attention of VC's we were like

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,779
being featured in other conventions and

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,019
then an hour like Dedra propulsor is now

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:23,540
abouting getting to about 13 thousand

00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:25,670
stars and then we have about 100,000

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,329
servers already deployed from the ones

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:33,980
you can track and about 2,000 new

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:35,629
deployments per week and yeah and our

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,009
docker image the feature one has been

00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:41,319
downloaded over a million times already

00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:45,319
so eventually we call attention of

00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:47,240
American big VC new enterprise

00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:49,850
associates I didn't know who those guys

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,339
were before maybe you guys already know

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,199
but just in case they're guys the some

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,600
of the company refunded is elasticsearch

00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:00,110
MongoDB Pentaho so no types of its

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,540
source fire sugar crm this is the open

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,429
source ones that the partner who

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:09,470
invested on us was on the board and

00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:11,880
helped grow they did over my 350 mergers

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,250
and acquisitions and over

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,170
200 IPOs so they are fairly large

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,420
organization they came to us and say

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,819
okay we'll give you five million dollars

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,190
now for you guys to focus on getting the

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:23,880
product better we wanted to keep it open

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,680
sirs

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,690
grow the community and move to a

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,980
business model that scales now not just

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:34,529
doing service of white labeling and

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,630
integration so you're going now that's

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:41,970
we're doing with rebuilding a whole

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:44,550
website documentation we build a deploy

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:50,759
tool on the out of a sass offering so if

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:52,440
someone wants to do a zero like zero

00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,790
knowledge deployed is just go there put

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,459
your name and email and then you have

00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:00,180
your team we partnered Google to they

00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:02,339
start having more google on the google

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,680
Summer of Code paying for developers for

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,699
us to help do more on the encryption

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,790
side and on the some of the other

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:14,310
features and you're doing a new UI

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,139
that's coming soon the acting the next

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,149
release you already going to see a much

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,790
much improved UI so if you guys have

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,019
already tested the current one there's a

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,639
new one coming out there's going to be

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:28,860
much more polished and then we also

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,300
build some native apps now because

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,899
there's apps that we have there before

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,750
were hybrid apps made in Cordova but I

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,430
figure that after trying for quite some

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,620
time we decided that to have the right

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,500
user experience and performance we were

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:48,120
going to build some native apps so those

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,529
re beat already and then we also built

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,750
you the platform to be deployed anywhere

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,880
in any platform almost like a raspberry

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,750
pi to a Windows server or Linux server

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,970
or Mac server literally to be able to

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:04,019
run anywhere in any cloud as well so you

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:09,269
have scripts to deploy on Amazon on this

00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:12,360
devotion or any sauce or or it snaps to

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:17,579
do no boom to and a few other Linux

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,380
distributions and then what we are the

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,449
way we are planning to monetize or to

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,630
scale or business model we are looking

00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,580
into chat applications as this paradigm

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,130
shifts

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,260
as it was from desktop clients to

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,330
browser websites now smartphones and

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,740
apps and then we are seeing more and

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:38,660
more is this chat applications becoming

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,490
the interface where we talk to services

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,590
as they are bought they interfere

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:50,380
interface with you and a good example if

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,610
you ever seen is we shot in China and

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,340
the Wall Street Journal is the one who

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,630
actually produced this picture and as I

00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,240
was quite an interesting because they

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,830
said they they show the day of a person

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,870
and they hold through the whole day

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,740
without even changing the app because

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:09,140
they find the guy to come and clean the

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,960
dog on the leash yet they pay using the

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,850
we share then they transfer money to put

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,100
on their investment account and you

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,410
share they call a cab on WeChat then

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,570
they go to your friends they get the go

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,580
to a restaurant and they get a menu on

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,830
WeChat they choose what they want to buy

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,560
rather than talking to a waitress on

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:30,080
WeChat and they pay the bill on we shall

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,700
do everything using different BOTS on

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,350
the on those channels but we one of the

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,190
reasons that they can do that in China

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,160
they have a really strong relationship

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,870
with the with the government and they

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,080
have which they give almost unlimited

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,240
access and they have pretty much all the

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,530
data for almost Ramallah at Google Plus

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,780
Amazon Plus Facebook plus they all

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,600
combined into a single organization that

00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,530
holds all this data on China and we

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,240
don't want this to happen so in some

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,260
ways ok how we're telling us you're

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,820
going to build a a platform where I have

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,000
all these BOTS and everybody going to

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,490
use it but you don't want to hold the be

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,070
a gatekeeper so our idea is we're

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,880
building now is this Federation protocol

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:21,589
inside using empirical there is another

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,430
organization building as well it's

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,750
called matrix and the idea is to

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,820
interconnect all the chat servers in a

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,380
similar way what you do with email so

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,030
there's no gatekeepers you just have

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,110
that protocol have all those servers and

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,270
then you allow anyone to join but no one

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:44,090
has control over this

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:49,750
Network Alison okay so we are building

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:52,730
these plugins and add-ons and and bought

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,070
marketplace so that's how we plan to

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,990
monetize and not under on the platform

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:03,050
itself so yeah our idea is now realize

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,630
it our vision became would be bigger or

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:09,760
more audacious so you want to have the

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:12,710
awesome UX that slack has we have a

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,570
reinvestment to participate and anyone

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,470
will be able to join even launch a team

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:20,780
on our SAS infrastructure also build a

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,410
very large ecosystem of bots and

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,260
services but on an open source and

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,070
optimized for flexibility platform with

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:34,160
the Federation of email and then that's

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:37,340
what we don't rocket yet to be and

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,380
you're getting there in many ways so if

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,410
you want to see a demo on more details

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,720
you can go to a website or can talk Mia

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,460
will be here today tomorrow and I'm

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,970
happy to show my computer if you have

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,970
any questions

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:56,299
