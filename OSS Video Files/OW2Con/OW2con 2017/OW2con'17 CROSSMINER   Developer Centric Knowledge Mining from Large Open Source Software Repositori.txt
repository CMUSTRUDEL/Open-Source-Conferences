Title: OW2con'17 CROSSMINER   Developer Centric Knowledge Mining from Large Open Source Software Repositori
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	Deciding if an OSS project meets the required standards for adoption is hard, and keeping up-to-date with a rapidly evolving project is even harder. Making decisions about quality and adoption involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions are made with detrimental effects.

This talk will make an overview of the EU H2020 CROSSMINER project, which aims to remedy such problems by automatically extracting required knowledge and injecting it into the developers' Integrated Development Environments (IDE), at the time they need it to make design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online IDE monitoring. Developers will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced ofï¬‚ine deep analyses of related OSS projects.
