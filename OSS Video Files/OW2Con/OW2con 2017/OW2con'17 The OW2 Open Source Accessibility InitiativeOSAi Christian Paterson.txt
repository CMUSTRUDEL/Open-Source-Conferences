00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,219
okay so it gives me great pleasure to

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,200
talk to you today about Ozai the

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,020
open-source accessibility initiative

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,369
that orange is heralded within Oh W -

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,490
obviously this is an initiative that

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,369
really exemplifies the strategy the

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,130
orange has around open-source and how it

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,250
can drive innovation and it's an

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,550
initiative that aligns perfectly with

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,579
the accessibility strategy as created

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,559
and has managed by the group

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,090
accessibility department headed by

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,340
France or any German it's been a journey

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,680
over the last 18 months to create this

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,180
initiative and so I thought what I'd do

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,860
today is rather than kind of tell you

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,320
directly about initiative is maybe talk

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,129
about that journey as we're here about

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,280
the challenges of open source it's a

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,129
journey that's really been difficult

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,460
challenging exciting but it's also shown

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,990
the different powers of open source to

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,580
bring the different people together

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,950
different people of different

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,590
backgrounds whether those are passionate

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,030
open sources or people who are or

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,100
inspiring accessibility experts

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,409
developers people from marketing people

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,200
people from HR people from many

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,579
different teams throughout the orange

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
organization but also of course

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:37,049
throughout the global world of open

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,240
source and of course it's thanks before

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,460
we go forward into the slides is thanks

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,680
to a number of key people who have

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,020
played an active part in occasion of

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,600
this act initiative so first of all a

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,420
thank you to the accessibility teams

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,470
within orange notably Sylvie Huber

00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:00,750
defent Stefan Duchamp gin-san Olien

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,610
Venetian Olivier Dooku as well so a big

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,040
thank you for them also a big THANK YOU

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,129
to the deans ik that intake is the

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,420
French IT department of the the French

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,860
government who were very keen and active

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,470
supporter of what we did

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,410
who recognized early on that open-source

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,800
can be a key way of furthering their

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,440
accessibility drivers but also a key way

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:35,130
of responding to their political driver

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:37,890
which is to have open governance okay so

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,560
you started to get a feeling from some

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,910
of the other presentations that

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,740
accessibility is kind of a big topic

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,030
right

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,120
not just in scope because obviously

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,910
we're talking about problems and

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,540
difficulties around visual or cognitive

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,880
physical auditory etc but in terms of

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,400
numbers I mean if we Microsoft mentioned

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,989
this point as well if we look at just

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,630
the pure numbers around people who are

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,400
impacted around accessibility its 22

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,340
percent of the u.s. population as

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,590
recognized by the CDC have 63 million

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,720
people globally that's one in seven

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,959
people or 1 billion people around the

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,970
world and these are like big numbers and

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,790
these are numbers are going to increase

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,830
with the changing Democrats changing

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,410
demographics so obviously we're in a

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:31,290
world that's changing we have a huge

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:35,549
audience here and those changes OOP some

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,709
animation those changes are also in

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,260
parallel to the fact that the world in

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,540
which we live in in terms of the tools

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,280
that we use the way we organize our work

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,810
the way we organize our social

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,150
interactions the way we organize our

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,060
lives generally are undergoing some

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,780
fundamental changes as well the world is

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,100
transforming digital technologies is are

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,950
transforming the world in which we live

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,480
in now I think that brings us to a

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,010
fundamental question which is something

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,310
that was touched on earlier this morning

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,739
around the ethics of what we do and the

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,220
fundamental question here around the

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,239
digital transformation is do you want a

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:18,600
digital transformation that truly

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,750
fosters increased inclusion or do you

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,169
want a digital transformation which is a

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,020
motor to disparity and exclusion with

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:30,340
some people being left behind

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,750
obviously I think we all know when we

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,740
ask the question like that I think the

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,750
answer is fairly obvious and ICT so

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,310
computer technologies digital

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,620
technologies have an enormous power to

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,280
transform the world societies and

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:53,110
economies in the way that benefits

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,110
everyone now if we look at open source

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,090
open sources you guys are mainly from

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,629
open source world here in the audience

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,300
so you know the open source is changing

00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,340
the technologies that we use and in fact

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,009
it's driving most of the technologies we

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,830
use today apart from the Internet where

00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,780
we saw open source being fundamental to

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,909
the creation of the world wide web from

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,340
the Apache browse the Apache servers

00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:20,979
Mozilla browser etc we also see today

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,620
open source as a driver behind the cloud

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:28,419
the Internet of Things connected objects

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:32,440
big data as a service platforms network

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,319
virtualization development tools if we

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,729
look at the network virtualization

00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,159
network virtualization obviously for a

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,520
telco like orange this is a crucial

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:44,740
aspect it's a transformation which is

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,190
absolutely revolutionary in the world of

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,270
telecommunications and the open source

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,960
is an enabler of these changes which is

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,960
fantastic

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,650
okay so as I said you guys are all

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,630
open-source I like to say magicians the

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,460
open-source sorcerers are hats off

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,200
because you have been the people who

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,420
have been driving these changes and

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,840
you're the people who will continue to

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,450
drive these changes so you play a

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,620
critical part in the world that's coming

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:27,210
up and you know better than me you know

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,240
the benefits from open source

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,450
you know how open source can drive this

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,750
kind of collaboration dynamics control

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:40,470
can drive and enhance code quality

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:43,170
through peer review how it can enable us

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,750
to have better control over our roadmaps

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:48,030
over our vendor sourcing strategy

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,710
freedoms we have the word earlier today

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:57,360
right so open source has some key key

00:06:52,710 --> 00:07:01,190
benefits but it's not always been easy

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,210
and it's still a difficult subject right

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,810
convincing people to go do

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,910
open source way requires a deep cultural

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,050
shift in the way we think and in the way

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,270
organizations think licenses are still a

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,190
question that rear their head and people

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,230
ask the question how do we handle these

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,950
licenses and of course we have to handle

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:26,400
them it's not the Wild West the way the

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,800
open-source as a strategy for delivering

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,730
new innovations impacts a commercial

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,460
strategy and the IPR strategy around

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,970
that these are critical questions that

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,520
we have to ask an answer continuously so

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:45,450
the use of open source regardless of its

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,430
benefits is still a question that is not

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,620
easy it's still something that we

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,280
struggle with within organizations of

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,230
many sizes but we see time and time

00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,750
again that open source Springs benefits

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,750
we see new startups using open source as

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,330
part of their innovation cycle to go

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,950
quicker maybe to have less expense on

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,590
their licensing during that innovation

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,110
phase whatever the reasons are in

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,090
small startups are using open-source to

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,950
drive innovation but within the bigger

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,310
companies the Microsoft's of the world

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:22,400
also turn into open-source so there has

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:28,440
to be kind of a reason for this right

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:33,030
and that's the benefits app it doesn't

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,100
drink okay so we see that the world is

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,500
changing we see there are demographic

00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,840
changes we see there is a digital trade

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,900
change a digital transformation and we

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,510
see that there are clear benefits around

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,480
open source but of course there are

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:52,560
clear benefits around accessibility and

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,960
having a real inclusion so accessibility

00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,570
and open source these are very much an

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:04,680
opportunity for companies are very much

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:09,150
an opportunity for us to be a part of a

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,990
good digital innovation ethics going in

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:17,160
the right way it's also a means of

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:21,570
touching a larger audience a means of

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,430
managing potential legal risks obviously

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,340
you you probably know that there are

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,680
laws around accessibility in terms of

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,880
accessible web services when you're

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,860
having a public platform or accessible

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,800
it work environments for your employees

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,070
I'm sure you know as well that various

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,200
public sector marketplaces increasingly

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:51,200
have accessibility as their criteria

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,490
within the RFI RFP processes and

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,610
generally the accessibility the

00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,240
accessibility audience itself is a large

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,200
number we saw the the numbers earlier so

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,390
there's a real opportunity here now how

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,630
and why did orange create the

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,130
open-source accessibility initiative

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,660
okay obviously we've seen some of the

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,580
benefits and we've seen kind of a logic

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,320
behind it but where do we come from on

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:22,140
this well Orange has always had a strong

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,420
open-source commitment and a strong

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,000
open-source strategy something we

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,980
me too to be an active partner within

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,070
open source we don't want to be seen as

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,430
just a kind of a user saying thank you

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:38,550
very much we want we want to be active

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,230
in the communities and for a number of

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,660
years we've had an open source

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:46,529
governance which promotes the use of

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,810
open source within the group fosters

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,930
collaboration in the wider ecosystems

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:55,199
and of course ensures that we play the

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,240
game correctly he shows that we respect

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:02,250
licenses ensures that we contribute back

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,760
and it was about two years ago that we

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,639
saw two projects go through our internal

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,149
compliance process and two projects

00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,519
focused on accessibility and for me that

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,829
that sets off a train of thought which

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,370
was well if we have projects going out

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:22,410
on open source there is only really one

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,000
reason to be publishing a project out on

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,300
open source it's because we want people

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,250
to feed on those projects we want people

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,290
to use the project's feedback give us

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:36,540
ideas join in etc so it seemed a logical

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:42,060
exercise to say rather than having these

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:44,519
two projects lost in github we will try

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,100
to organize them so there's some kind of

00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,470
unified space for these two projects for

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,870
people to come in and say ok projects on

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,769
accessibility open source organized by

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,630
Orange Wow

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,010
ok cool we're going to join in on that

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,310
we're going to use them we're going to

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,310
feedback information fantastic and then

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,940
of course you sit down for 30 seconds if

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,350
that and you can go hang on if we're

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,110
trying to have a collaboration space

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,510
around open source and around these

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,209
accessibility projects it doesn't really

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,550
make any sense to have this as an orange

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,740
branded exercise because the whole

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,949
notion of open source is that anyone can

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,360
join in and we would like other

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,550
participants to join in but we'd also

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,639
like other participants to propose their

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:34,589
own projects so that's why we very

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,959
quickly jumped from here are some left

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,860
alone projects going out on open source

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,480
to

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,269
we will create an initiative around

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,980
accessibility that fosters a real

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:50,100
community around this subject we want to

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,010
encourage collaboration bring in the

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,990
wider ecosystems and we know that

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,079
resources are constrained within teams

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,050
especially accessibility teams and so we

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,990
want to add all costs avoid reinventing

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,269
the wheel we've heard of frameworks

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,149
we've heard of page testers for

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,490
accessibility I suspect there's multiple

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,589
versions of based page testers for

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,380
accessibility how can we all work

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,230
together so that we can truly create a

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:23,370
new innovation rather than continually

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,410
the same thing so where are we today

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:31,230
with this journey this 18-month journey

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:33,690
that started 18 months ago of course o W

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:37,380
to have been a fantastic help creating

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:40,070
this community not long ago we released

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,149
a charter so good governance charter

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,060
because we wanted it to be a community

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,910
that was properly governed and probably

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,449
organized so we had a charter we drew up

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,640
a charter with the different parties

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:58,220
that were starting to be interested last

00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:02,220
year we've created an initiative that

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:06,470
organizes discussions research the

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,990
projects etc around seven domains

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,980
we've already attracted 18 participant

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:17,670
participating organizations coming from

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,880
five different countries mainly France

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,420
at the moment but also Italy Switzerland

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,600
the UK even India and I know we attract

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,970
as well by people in the US we have a

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,620
growing presence on Twitter we've

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,699
released our first project through to

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:38,190
the ow2 marketplace and this is a new

00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:44,339
initiative that only really went live in

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:47,640
the last few months so where are the

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,010
challenges next the negative what's

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,870
coming up the real challenge is now our

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,250
this initiative and I guess as

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,220
open-source people you probably

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,810
understand these challenges it's one

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,160
thing to have an open-source community

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,980
is one thing to have an open-source

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,550
project but having true collaboration on

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:09,490
those projects that's a real challenge

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,310
so bringing our participants into true

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,080
collaboration deepening the

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,030
collaboration deepening the sharing

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,570
that's a real challenge that we're

00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:24,330
starting to attack now and the next and

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:28,840
the second major challenge for us is to

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:30,820
expand our horizons so we have these 18

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,250
participate in order organizations

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,470
within various countries we want to

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,310
expand that we want to have more

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,010
organizations more countries we know we

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,440
have a unique opportunity there's no

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,750
other open source initiative that we

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,860
know of that's broadly based around

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,410
accessibility so it's a we call for you

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,300
we call for the people here in the

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,820
audience today and the people who might

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,210
watch this on streaming later to come

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,960
and join this initiative many

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,880
discussions I think really some cool

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,370
advantages I know people are now even

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,790
starting to look at for example machine

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,650
learning and accessibility so it's a

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,770
snowball effect that we've already

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:21,580
started to see happen and we welcome all

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:24,520
new people of all new domains whether

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,340
they're IT people HR people accessing

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:33,430
the accessibility people French English

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:35,470
American Chinese globally and we hope

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:40,240
that we will see you again in a year and

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:45,310
have an even more dynamic and a great

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:48,400
great advance to show you so that's the

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,090
open source accessibility initiative 18

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,850
months a real journey fantastic support

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,160
from owt too and I hope you guys also

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,500
have fantastic support from ow2 like us

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,690
because it's clearly a true benefit

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,680
thank you very much enjoy the rest of

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,310
the conference

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,300
thank you

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,300
