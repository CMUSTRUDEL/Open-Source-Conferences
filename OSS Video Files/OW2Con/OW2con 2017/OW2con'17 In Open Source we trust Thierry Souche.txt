00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:11,969
in open-source we trust yeah that's I

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,889
think quite a compelling start the are

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,949
plenty of dimensions in open-source and

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,880
I'm pretty sure not everyone measures to

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,449
which point open source currently is

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,980
critical to what we do as an operator I

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:27,930
don't believe we are so much more

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,910
advanced with open sores any any other

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,830
operator so I guess what I'm about to

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,350
say is pretty well shared across the

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:41,120
operators community first if you

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,010
consider everything in our businesses I

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,930
think open source is pouring each and

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,360
every engineering device we are putting

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,000
in the ends of our customer right there

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,399
is Linux there there is a an

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,500
accumulation of open-source solutions in

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,690
each and every device so everything we

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,329
do with our consumer very much is

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,579
powered with open source I'm not even

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,290
saying is speaking about every server

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:11,159
and our data centers which is powered

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:16,439
with Linux moving to data centers so mr.

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,750
Jerry I will bow to the work that has

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,869
been done a tremendous work that has

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,630
been done to let's say open source our

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,630
data centers move from a totally

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,259
proprietary and locked world towards a

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,490
much more open and I would say much

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,500
brighter future I hope with OpenStack

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,920
it's not just OpenStack it's the spirit

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,840
that comes with which which brings us an

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,450
opportunity to completely revamp and

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,810
change the relationship with our

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,490
ecosystem so why not when I consider

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,340
OpenStack it considers these lineups

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,869
that will power my data center but it is

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,380
also bringing all partners all vendors

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,820
to review their position and for most of

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,540
them to move from hardware to software

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,060
and to deliver to me a software that

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,580
will natively interoperate with a basis

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,640
which is not theirs but the one of the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,350
industry

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,080
and that is a very deep shift for us as

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,330
we used to operate data centers in a

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,810
very closed way very manual way very

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,690
hardware orientated way but it is also a

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,690
drastic shift to them because when they

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:35,260
were used to ship me some racks and

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,090
piece of hardware and man Monday's or

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,250
man months of integration bla bla bla

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,160
the experiencing I need from them is a

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,410
link to their get that's a bit of a

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,820
difference see right so the whole

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,860
industries is being rocking by this

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,410
OpenStack stuff so I don't think you

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:58,540
measure to which important to which step

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,010
you are important going beyond it's not

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,450
just that essentially the whole network

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:09,040
and we add for instance very very

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:11,470
fruitful cooperation with AT&T AT&T made

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,780
something which was quite clever which

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:18,160
they called ecomp right which was a way

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,560
to get control as an operator on the

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,650
network and not just give the control

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,540
back to Windows well we had a lot of

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,840
discussions and we decided we would turn

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,070
that jointly into open source because

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,430
that was a way to gather the whole

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,620
industry on one shared approach to the

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,120
future of the network and that has

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:43,480
turned into an app so if you take Linux

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,180
if you take OpenStack if you take own

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,370
app we're just moving up the value chain

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,350
step by step and ringing open source to

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,370
each and every piece of our network

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,650
ecosystem and that is again a drastic

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:02,110
shift because when you when you consider

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:04,840
what one app is and you put yourself in

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,850
the shoes of our traditional partners

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,739
and vendors then tomorrow

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,170
they just will register their

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,940
applications into a store and we're

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,549
going to retrieve that application from

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,070
the store put it in a network done right

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:21,400
it it should be and obviously it will

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,140
not but it should be as simple as when

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,900
you take your your Android device and

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,060
you just pull an app from the store Wow

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,410
that's a change for an industry which

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,990
was used to take nine months to

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,960
integrate the slightest piece of network

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,250
node in their data center right so this

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,500
is a kind of example of the shift in

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,850
nature but their shift in essence that

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:50,630
the industry is turnings were another

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,270
element which I think is is exemplifying

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,850
our open source critical is critical to

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,889
arrange when you go and visit for

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,830
instance teams which are developing our

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,639
IOT platforms it's about next door

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:08,150
50 meters over there in that direction

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:11,000
look at their tools the whole C ICD

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,979
tooling is open source there's not one

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,639
single piece of it which is licensed or

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:19,639
proprietary why because by essence when

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,580
you can get development teams jumping

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,660
into a project if they have to re learn

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,720
everything around their environment

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,460
everything about the tooling etc you

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,950
would have just a massive loss of time

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,710
right so you go by default to the

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,550
standards and the standards are

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:41,960
open-source tools do they meet all our

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,760
requirements no so instead of trying and

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,830
get a vendor and reach them blah blah

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,960
blah commit do the development adapt it

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,240
to your needs commit try and convince

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,789
the community that it is valuable to the

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,550
tool and get the community to embrace

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,729
your vision it's a totally different

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,199
relationship between orange and everyone

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:08,960
within orange in the our ecosystem

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:14,449
meaning don't put dollars on the table

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,949
good line of code meaning the one who is

00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,599
making a difference is the one who is

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,810
actually contributing and not the one

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,580
who is signing the check that's a total

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,479
reverse way of thinking within the

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,729
company right and that is what we call

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,500
for with regard to how orange should

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,560
evolve now I don't believe this is

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,930
anyway specific to Orange I do believe

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,250
deeply that every operator in the world

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,010
is going through the same transformation

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,520
and that calls for the last bit of the

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,210
of

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,760
transformation which is really how does

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:51,770
does open-source transform the culture I

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,620
was seeing hinting at the developers

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,300
developers are seeing something else in

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,250
open-source it's about a culture of

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,160
sharing it's also about a culture of

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07,700
setting the highest standard of

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,070
expertise and being recognized by peers

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,230
right I think the other theory is

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,930
extremely demanding when it comes to

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,570
anything contributed back to OpenStack

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,580
right and that sets the standard for our

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,160
development team if they want to be

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,290
perceived as value making by the

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,380
communities they need to be at the best

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,560
level and that's true for every

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,050
community we may contribute to you now

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,330
the payer recognition they will receive

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,000
from the community is at least as

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,750
valuable in their perspective as the one

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,580
they will get from their management that

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,580
sir doesn't say that we should oppose

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,370
them right so for instance amongst the

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,380
the the value and the culture change we

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,610
should go on the go as an operator is

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,490
okay how do I include integrate those

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,480
feedbacks from the communities in my

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,000
recognition system not only as the

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,000
management recognition for their

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,240
contribution right this is a very deep

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,720
cultural shift opening our way of

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,260
working

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,410
our contribution expertise into the

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,960
culture of the company goes together

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,910
with agile methodologies goes through

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,330
the group together with DevOps blah blah

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:29,150
blah draw draw the line you will get a

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,000
totally totally reversed way of thinking

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:36,680
within orange so I think yeah in

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,980
open-source we trust on open source we

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:45,290
leverage to open source swimmer's

00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:47,340
contribute and final but not least open

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,570
source will changes

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:54,630
much more deeply than we ever sewed five

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,290
to ten years ago open source is not just

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,390
about averaging online acts right open

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,060
source is about changing the way we

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,220
interact with our ecosystem there is

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,279
maybe one bit where I saw cherry was a

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,130
little bit negative and where I see a

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,850
fantastic apology to reconcile different

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:18,450
worlds standardization and

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:20,790
standardization bodies one thing which I

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:27,210
think you underestimate is how much you

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:30,720
influence then for instance when there

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:33,920
are tricky stuff around how two systems

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,110
should interact either you spend ages

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,800
describing by the detail each in every

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,140
possible way

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,450
or you contribute a standard code that

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,640
will demonstrate the system which will

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,970
be set as a reference and by the way

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,100
obviously it can be open source so I

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,860
think there is a need for

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,720
Standardization I think there is a need

00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,400
for open source and I do not want to

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,760
oppose them actually I would like to

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,180
feed one with the other and I do have a

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,610
strong hope that by leveraging much more

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,740
on software and open source we might be

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,510
we might get the standardization more

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,420
and more agile more and more flexible

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:19,800
more involved to the tune with our

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:22,230
actual needs so yeah I hope one day

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,450
you're going to go unseen and you will

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,580
tell us we had a fantastic experience

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,970
with operators because it brought us the

00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,860
best of both worlds open source in

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,860
standardization and if that could set an

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,500
ambitious target on us let's take it but

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,650
welcoming open source in an organization

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,630
is extremely demanding is extremely

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,150
challenging it is a cultural challenge

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,890
more than a technical challenge we in

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,779
orange have decided to tackle that

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,020
challenge and to really welcome open

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,630
source in every possible way it is

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,600
shaking everywhere of working our

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,889
processes our appraisals of people

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,639
etcetera etcetera so thanks

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:06,279
a lot I think a w-2 is a long time

00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:11,230
partner and we intend to keep it that

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:13,959
way we have quite a lot of dependencies

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,970
as orange top source and we have more

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,249
and more and more contribution to open

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,009
source communities so thank you a lot

00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:24,279
and I will disappear so that you can all

00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:26,730
rush on the food unless you have

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,730
questions

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:34,179
