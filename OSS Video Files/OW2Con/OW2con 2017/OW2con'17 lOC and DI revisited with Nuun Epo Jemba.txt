Title: OW2con'17 lOC and DI revisited with Nuun Epo Jemba
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	In this track, we present, Nuun is a powerful and flexible micro-framework for building enterprise class applications and stacks. 

Nuun brings another experience where developers do not spend time working on configuration. Configuration can be encapsulated in modules so developers can focus on writing application code.

Nuun brings a clean kernel/plugin design plus a JSR 330 compliant injection mechanism backed by Google Guice. It is designed to be compatible with the major injection frameworks (spring, guice for now, tapestry, picocontainer, jodd, etc to come ...). Nuun aims to be a reference for enterprise application development.

Nuun makes a clear separation between stack developers and business developers. Stack developers will define convention and high level technical aspects by creating plugins. Then business developers will be free from configuration and will be able to focus on business issues not technical issues.
