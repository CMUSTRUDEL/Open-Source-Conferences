00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:14,519
I'm here to explain to you why worldline

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:21,119
join us I and how and we make a lot of

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:25,019
ID design and system in high critical

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,170
system like payment online or elf or

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,019
transportation systems we have a lot of

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,270
customers in private or public sectors

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,059
and more and more for a long time

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,790
already they ask us to integrate

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,149
accessibility in their project they want

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,629
the solution to be accessible so we do a

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,200
lot of things and within the the crew

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:52,199
battles we do even more things but we

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,050
have to be humble here and what we

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,120
discovered what we know now and what I

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,969
want to explain to you is always a work

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,039
in progress so taking into account

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,609
accessibility is always a work in

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,760
progress

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,820
have two main example in mind to

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,710
illustrate that point the first one is

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,380
how to deal with employees who have

00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:20,100
accessibility needs I know two of them

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,170
they were both visually impaired the

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,869
first one has to leave the company

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,479
because you couldn't fault you couldn't

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,210
work properly with the tools that were

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,350
provided to him so that's a mistake

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,909
that's failure for us and the second one

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:42,360
is expert Big Data expert and he had to

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,460
go back to management tasks because the

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,439
tooling that she was using every day

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,540
was it was not able to deploy and nature

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,600
is a expertise in big data which is the

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,939
same for for this guy and which is the

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,729
same also for worldline because we need

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,780
to the search expertise and search big

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,570
data scientists experts so on the

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,220
employee side we still have worked in

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,009
progress we still have a room for

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,480
improvement and of course in on the

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,560
right spot develops

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,170
teams and not all the project of course

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,599
but I know of several project where the

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,250
development teams the stood

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,769
accessibility constraint as a

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,989
non-functional requirement and they said

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,810
okay no problem we'll deal with it don't

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,459
worry and then when the audit came they

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,300
had to rebuild the world interface

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,849
mobile interface web interface so the

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,840
last time we lost money and the customer

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:46,799
was not happy so it looks like every day

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:51,599
every day story but that's well story

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:55,650
that we had in in world line and so we

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,750
decided to tackle with that and one of

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:07,410
the way to do that is to enter outside

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:12,510
now I go on my next slide if I can more

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:14,489
text okay and so what as I said the

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,700
first image was a bit scary because it

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,069
looks like post apocalyptic image it's

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,319
just that everything is not shiny we

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,019
still have to work and we have to stay

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,540
humble and it's better to watch them to

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,250
see reality so that's how we will be

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,170
able to deal with it

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,239
so it's in 3/4 the direction the call

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,040
steps on the slide but it's more

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,230
parallel stream of action the first step

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:47,160
is to learn and develop awareness then

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,590
gather expertise and knowledge start

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,090
doing improving and doing tangible

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:57,810
things and then enter a larger community

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,819
first step of course what we learn what

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,489
we're learning every day we have still

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,500
to be aware about what is going on on

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,590
our project what is going on on our

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,590
teams we used several

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,980
event internal events into a toast group

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:22,300
like the Global Attitudes accessibility

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:24,460
or technical early technical event in

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,560
worldline called tech forum where we

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,860
created a special track on accessibility

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,410
to raise awareness about accessibility

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:39,790
to identify the people and to try to

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:44,110
tackle with this this issues which leads

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,630
me to the step to is gather expertise

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,419
and knowledge there are a lot of people

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,169
into a world line or it will Atos on a

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,400
larger scale that has skills on

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,340
accessibility but they spread all around

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,390
the organization so the main objective

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:04,810
of this track is to identify the expert

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,990
first wherever they are and then to make

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,120
them discuss between themselves so we

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,510
have people now in the US studio team

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,000
which is a global team transversal team

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,630
and world line with designers graphic

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,960
designers and economists but also people

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,050
in R&D people from consulting with a

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,240
speciality on accessibility people from

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:33,760
the group there are things that are done

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,790
in UK support from amplitude it's me not

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:41,580
only me that I bother it and the

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,400
distance disciplinary movement is

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,740
important for us because we have the

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,530
power we have the the will but it's

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,160
spread so we have to focus in to to make

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,979
converge all those energies and that's

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,169
the the subject of the track of step

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,520
number three is to start doing real

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:08,760
things to put to to deliver tangible

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:12,160
assets so we launched several POC based

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,310
on the step two and the knowledge and

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,410
the expertise that we identified and for

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,560
instance this is one very interesting

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,569
because it's at the core business of

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,999
world line is the

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,520
payment terminal so it's a POC ongoing

00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,759
now it's called bold line here to be to

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,270
pay so it's to allow people with

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,939
visually impaired disability to be able

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:40,469
to use a payment terminal on another way

00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:43,259
and the team involved in those POC are

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:45,869
from Rd of course but also from the you

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,009
extreme also from other teams all around

00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:53,159
the organization so this point is

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:57,749
interesting but what what we can see

00:06:53,159 --> 00:07:00,379
here is we identify the expenses we make

00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:02,939
them talk together we have new ideas and

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,520
then we understand that accessibility is

00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,610
part of the innovation of worldline so

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,339
it's not a burden or something that we

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,819
have to implement and say okay I will do

00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:17,519
it I don't notice another technical

00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,580
difficulties now it's seen as a way to

00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,519
innovate but we have to spread this

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,659
energy of innovation to diffuse this

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,509
willingness this will say to to to deal

00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:33,029
with accessibility in the rest of the

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:36,629
enterprise so that's why the other asset

00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:39,809
the ruling that we created is to change

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:43,199
the mindset of the world line as a

00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:46,019
company to integrate innovation as more

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,879
than necessity as something that we we

00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,649
have to build on so that's right there

00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,050
are kind of business like brochures that

00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:56,149
were created to raise the awareness

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,399
around those issues and to avoid the

00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:02,879
problem I was talking about on the first

00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:05,560
slide we launched a large program to

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,140
teach and learn

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,750
our development but not only development

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,470
testing and all teams involved you know

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,140
creating our project to integrate

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,590
accessibility as part of their work

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:25,090
everyday job and avoid to start and let

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:27,610
people start building project without

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,630
knowing anything or without not knowing

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,710
they don't know anything about

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,060
accessibility

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,169
that's even worse they think they know

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:38,260
so we have this learning session and

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:42,300
it's a large program with more and more

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:47,110
people following those teaching lessons

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,990
and finally the step for because if you

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,460
summarize what we did before and I could

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:59,050
make a parallel with open source mode

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:02,500
movement first you learn you watch you

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:06,130
you understand then you group your

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,340
develop you share and then you

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,220
contribute you you build something and

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:15,010
this movement the third movement is just

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,839
the generalization of this open source

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:22,710
way of sharing and sharing a knowledge

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,040
and best practices and technical assets

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,230
in the accessibility work for Earth and

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,100
for me personally open source is the

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,970
best vector to do such things

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,190
so we participate in several initiatives

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,700
also one of the most that's why I'm here

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,700
thank you again

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,370
so we contribute you we share we discuss

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,580
with other enterprises we're dealing

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,900
with the same issues as us and several

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,560
brains together will be more smart

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:01,600
intelligent and we also I took just one

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,030
example you see which is cour we also

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,950
contribute technical assets because as a

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,760
IT company we developed a lot of things

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:14,980
and particularly now in under open

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:18,260
source licenses Kara is one of them it's

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:23,930
markup library who created created

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:26,420
source graphical components that are

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,410
accessible by design and that can be

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:35,120
used to build quickly or quicker

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:39,140
accessible UI what is interesting is the

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,870
care team is mainly composed of people

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,170
from the uuk studio so it's not only

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,160
technical people again the work and the

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,440
value of such assets is coming from the

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,900
fact that it's plural and

00:10:51,440 --> 00:11:00,010
transdisciplinary if work and teamwork

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,010
