Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	Hammr is an OW2 open source, command-line tool for creating consistent and repeatable machine images for different cloud or virtual environments, or migrating live systems from one environment to another. Designed for cloud-era environments, where agility and automation are key, hammr helps organizations automate the creation of machine images for hybrid environments. This presentation will focus on how hammr can integrate with existing DevOps toolchains, and how it can be used to quickly build and run trusted Docker images with full software governance. Finally, we will present the latest hammr features, including expanded cloud support (Azure Resource Manager and Fujitsu Cloud Service K5), enhanced design of software bundles, and Multi-NIC support, allowing users to support several network interfaces within a VPN or externally.
