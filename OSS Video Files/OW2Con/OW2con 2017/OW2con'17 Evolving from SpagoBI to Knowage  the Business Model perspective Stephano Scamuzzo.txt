Title: OW2con'17 Evolving from SpagoBI to Knowage  the Business Model perspective Stephano Scamuzzo
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	Changing minds are the leading actors of innovation !
After 12 years of experience in the open source Community, the OW2 SpagoBI project evolves its business model in the aim of providing the community and the market with an even more featured product with a transparent positioning.
Starting from the recently released version 6, the project is branded as Knowage and distributed under two editions:
- a Community Edition, fully open source and supported by the Community
- an Enteprise Edition, fully supported by Engineering under a subscription model

The Knowage Community Edition leverages on  the whole SpagoBI experience and evolves into a more mature and competitive trend to fulfill the criteria of a Modern BI suite, including traditional and advanced analytics based on Big Data. It keeps on stimulating the contribution from the open source community and the collaboration with OW2 projects and initiatives.

The presentation will tell the history of a long life project, walking together with OW2 from the beginning, focusing on the main choices debated and taken during its lifetime:
- the licensing model, from LGPL to MPL and now AGPL
- the business model, from service-centric to features-centric
- the distribution model, from single-edition to multiple-editions

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,910
okay so welcome everybody it's always a

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,260
pleasure to talk in this w to animal

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,320
confidence especially this year that we

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,250
have this celebration of ten years of w2

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,180
and in fact today it's about giving

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,189
value to the past and moving forward to

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,830
the future and so the story of Spicoli

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,579
is just in this part because the history

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:44,520
of Spike OB I started in 2005 so even

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:48,120
before the Oh W to was was born and we

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,000
entered in fact ow2 in 2007 and Spago B

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,620
I was already among the top three

00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,660
downloaded produce from W to Forge and

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,780
now is looking forward to the to the

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,180
future and the following the innovation

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,420
in market and the technology and the

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,140
maturity of open source solutions we

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,710
decided to add this sort of revolution

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:23,250
as Daniela called it which is in by the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:26,630
way rebranding the spec OPI as no age of

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,360
course evolving its functionalities and

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,930
adapting its its model we were this

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,170
morning about business models where do

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,750
we start from do you remember this in

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,659
2008 I was used to use this slide which

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,930
was the first time that Gardner paid

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,780
attention to open source solutions in

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,909
the BI domain and the dispute being

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,250
simply to the effect that one and one

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,320
single analyst in got that were

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,899
interested and curious about open

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,250
sourcing bi and I remember that we met

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,930
him just the year before at open source

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,090
business conference in San Francisco

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,160
together with justice often pin Tao

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,890
which were the other and at wit which

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,920
were the other actors in bi open source

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,740
and interefere was written then by 2000

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,020
twelve open-source solutions should

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,819
average maturity and that have been

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,790
demonstrated and by 2017 that is today

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:29,849
open-source in bi would become just

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,180
another way to procure software and this

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,160
is what we are telling today about open

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,760
source being a mainstream this is true

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,410
also of course in bi but in the same

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,890
time we live in a completely different

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:49,019
world right now compared to ten years

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:54,840
ago and now if you look at about at all

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:58,160
the analysis on bi market and Audi the

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,590
demand for BI solutions is evolving

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,400
there are some aspects which are which

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,819
we can see as specific differentiators

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,780
one is the involvement of business

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,480
consumers in the production of

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,260
analytical information and this is the

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,100
way bi product and solution are evolving

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:28,910
to answer the bi users requirements the

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:32,670
second one is the value that is given to

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,579
analysis especially regarding advanced

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,250
analysis this is nothing new for people

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,410
who have been working in bi for years

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,420
because also in the first version of

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,090
spaghetti I there were few engines but

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,299
one of these was data mining and now

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,510
with data scientist with big data and so

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,930
on

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,810
data mining is known by all the word as

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,959
an effective value and okay now we have

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,829
added our we have either Python but we

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,980
are still in this kind of domain of

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:07,890
context the now the market is ready now

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,989
the market is demanding and and so we

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,700
have to to answer to give to provide the

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,380
market with the answer to evolve to

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,539
adapt and that's why we need to evolve

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,849
to together with the technology together

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:27,540
with the market and so what is the path

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:32,490
from Spago bi to no age is too

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:36,450
getting out from the technical vision of

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:40,020
a general purpose platform adaptable

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,970
flexible to all the specific content

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,030
domain and zone which remains through of

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:49,470
course but pushing and focusing also on

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:53,460
vertical solutions and addressing with

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,220
specific modules the specific needs so

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,920
that's why we organized the new age

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,980
platform in a modular way so we have a

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,080
focus on big data where the values is of

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,870
course in providing advanced analytics

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:13,560
on a multivariate source of data

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,810
including of course a dupe NoSQL smart

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,210
intelligence which is in order to answer

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,540
that demand of data discovery from

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:25,410
business consumers so in the possibility

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,280
to create their own cockpits and to

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,860
manage their own data of course we have

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,310
still enterprise reporting to address

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,070
the needs of people who need to have

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,720
pixel-perfect reporting schedule ad in

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,390
era in the right time for the right

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,130
people in zone location intelligence

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,550
which is extremely important in

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,800
integrating business data together with

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,290
geographical data to represent

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,760
indicators on geographical maps and this

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,820
has been present from the first version

00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:02,100
of spaghetti I to performance management

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:05,700
that is out to define calculate KPIs and

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:09,690
how to associate others to kpi's in such

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:14,150
a way to be learned that when some

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:18,000
critical situations are reached or some

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:21,810
good excellent performance already rich

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,140
and then predictive analysis this is

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,420
where all the results coming from the

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,390
integration of advanced analytics

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:35,520
simulation models forecasting models and

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:38,220
so on is is important and all these of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,900
course in a scenario where you can

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,710
integrate

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:49,410
business intelligent features inside

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:52,350
other products through a open API which

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,220
is the scenario as I was a-telling now

00:06:52,350 --> 00:07:00,570
we talk generally about two different

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:04,500
kind of users that are served at the

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:07,080
same way of course with different tools

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,340
and different approaches but with the

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:15,600
same solution the first one is the first

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,600
one is the scenario where the IT team

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,780
inside the company manages consolidated

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,730
data so it is the ability to take data

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,490
to organize them and to provide a

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:34,250
consistent data set to two to two people

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:37,050
who need to analyze them so they provide

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,380
organization of data they provide maybe

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,230
some predefined analytical scenarios but

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,420
then we have we have business users

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,990
business consumers what they do the day

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,570
they consult the data prepared by the

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,970
technical team but they also are able to

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:59,550
add their own data because sometimes

00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:01,620
data are not available in the in the

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,630
consolidated environment in the

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,970
consolidated data warehouse they can

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,000
come from open data sources for example

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:13,410
using sequence standard or somewhere

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,500
else they can come from local data

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:19,920
personal only the data and so on and all

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,210
of these data can be integrated together

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,880
with the consolidated data using the

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,950
Federation mechanisms which is new to

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,740
annoy age compared to Spago behind such

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,729
a way to provide a consistent solution

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,810
and to share data and analysis together

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:43,260
with other users so this is what

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:47,839
governor calls the modern bi where IT

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:51,450
and business consumers collaborate in

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,070
creating value for information almost

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,260
all of these is

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,820
through the concept of the universal

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,460
data set in no age which is the way to

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,990
access data using standard technical

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:09,870
means from the IT team in order to

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,040
access to traditional data SQL but also

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,720
a dupe and no SQL and soul music the

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,160
specific languages of these tools but

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,950
also from the end-user point of view to

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,380
to inquiry the data using a language

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,260
which is closer to the business

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,410
languages in such and such a way to

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,830
manipulate only business entities and

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:39,060
not technical entities and all in order

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:42,690
to produce an analysis from traditional

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,850
ones to advanced advanced in such a way

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,360
to not person not to perceive the

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,400
difference between the two way to access

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,450
the actual data sources

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,580
okay so we have spoke of a evolve that

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:01,460
in to know age we have a Community

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:04,560
Edition where we have all the

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,740
contributions from the community we have

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,970
all the tools which are all set by w2 it

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,910
was just released a few days ago with

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,490
all the the tools for the community from

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,030
the forums to the trackers and and so on

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,810
and then we have the Enterprise Edition

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:27,090
that which adds basically professional

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:31,170
services to support the companies in

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:34,290
adopting no age in critical projects and

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,910
some tools in order to facilitate the

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,680
adoption to ease the life of

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:44,280
administrators to manage the projects a

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,570
simple just to give you in the in the

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,060
end because I know that my time is

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,950
almost over to the some let's say flavor

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,190
or the project consider that we have a

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,560
booth in the the open area and open

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,810
space so that so if you want to have

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,390
more details you can come in and

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,010
visitors this is the new environment

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,570
which has been completely redesigned

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,510
using angular

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:14,060
as a frame worker so you can use it the

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:17,070
same way on a desktop or a mobile device

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,410
we have a interactive cockpit that is

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,380
exactly the way that users build

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,900
information coming from different

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,870
sources they join together all these

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:33,020
information in order to provide the user

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:35,730
with a really attractive way to consult

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:40,350
information and the to perform data

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:43,620
discovery we added a lot of new charts

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,070
which are extremely important when we

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,530
analyze big data because the analysis on

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,660
big data is not focused on individual

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,180
data but more on a cluster at the

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,180
phenomena and so we have to use a new

00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:00,060
kind of chart such as for example it

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,480
Maps outliers sambars

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,270
and so on and all these now can be done

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,780
with a designer which is totally

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:13,700
exploited on the web browser so without

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,860
any need to install the specific client

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,500
application we still have reports we

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,440
have a multi-dimensional analogy with

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,200
oil AP that can be used also in a

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,980
predictive way with the simulation

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,540
scenario that is supported by the by D

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,220
what if that supports for example

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,890
scenarios of a budget definitions or

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,440
resource allocations and so on we still

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,600
have the integration with the GIS where

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,320
we added a lot of functionalities that

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,470
allows to use the geographical system

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,930
also as a selectors for performing data

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,510
analysis and the D KPI and that's the

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,360
way also we move the to the browser the

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,240
creation of meta models so we don't need

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,920
any more specific client to create

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,340
metamodels but everything is managed in

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,970
the web in the web browser so I thank

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,190
you for for the attention and of course

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,210
if you need some more details you can

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:20,740
come and visit us and thank you again or

00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:23,740
w24 these

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,740
