Description: 
	Changing minds are the leading actors of innovation !
After 12 years of experience in the open source Community, the OW2 SpagoBI project evolves its business model in the aim of providing the community and the market with an even more featured product with a transparent positioning.
Starting from the recently released version 6, the project is branded as Knowage and distributed under two editions:
- a Community Edition, fully open source and supported by the Community
- an Enteprise Edition, fully supported by Engineering under a subscription model

The Knowage Community Edition leverages on  the whole SpagoBI experience and evolves into a more mature and competitive trend to fulfill the criteria of a Modern BI suite, including traditional and advanced analytics based on Big Data. It keeps on stimulating the contribution from the open source community and the collaboration with OW2 projects and initiatives.

The presentation will tell the history of a long life project, walking together with OW2 from the beginning, focusing on the main choices debated and taken during its lifetime:
- the licensing model, from LGPL to MPL and now AGPL
- the business model, from service-centric to features-centric
- the distribution model, from single-edition to multiple-editions
