00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,470
well again thank you very much for being

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,420
here

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,230
I invite John Papillon who is our the

00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,139
chairman of the board and the president

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,230
of lw2 to give us a few words of

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,810
introduction so good morning everybody

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,420
I remember was that when I was a student

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,140
I was a real geek and free software

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,150
zealot and what was attracting me the

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,270
the free software was the the openness

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,640
and I feel like everything was possible

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,829
because I could access to source code

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,320
documentation fir'aun's while

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,450
proprietary software meant tons of

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,969
documentation paying documentation and

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:51,329
so finally the innovation possible which

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,460
free software was was what attracting

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,190
mean in a free software the challenge at

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,010
that time was mainly about funny

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,520
business model because computing is my

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,409
job and not only a passion and I think

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,060
that this challenge is the main one that

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,310
ability to has been addressing from the

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,950
beginning and with the certain success

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,159
but now that a bunch of software is

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,020
becoming more and more mainstream we all

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
see that this ecosystem is facing new

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,439
challenges and I want to mention some of

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,439
them the first one is standing out from

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,600
all the open source jungle if you go on

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,310
github you have millions of lines of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,799
code and on projects the second one is

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,229
proving that the quality of open source

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:43,079
software is there and not only claiming

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,820
it and also for standing out and the

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,460
third one I want to mention is keeping

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,920
the software ecosystem open for

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,939
innovation for users freedom and privacy

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,640
and not only with free software licenses

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,149
but with the promo of data privacy and

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,770
so on and this is a big challenge this

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,469
new challenge is audible you want to

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,390
address them today and we are addressing

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,160
already dance through all the projects

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,220

00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:54,629
ten years or ten years we have to go

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,409
back to the beginning and this picture

00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:01,139
reflects one of the defining moments of

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:03,300
of what was object where the repository

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:08,490
shattered by enviable and France télécom

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,310
and the and in fact that is the moment

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,789
when the team the Jeunesse team Jonas

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,639
who was the flagship project around

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:21,330
which I don't have the return did I do

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:24,389
something hello so Jonas was the sexy

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,240
project of audibility two of object web

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,090
and then went on to become the main

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,069
project or to EE to and this picture the

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,449
one there you can see was taken by

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,629
France while Atelier

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:39,949
oh my effect is ruined

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:42,120
but anyway so Francois hit there who was

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,789
some not sure whether this picture was

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,099
taking a bull or INRIA that was India

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,289
yes so he was there and happened to take

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,000
the picture at the precise moment and I

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,080
really love this picture it's one of the

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,379
the iconic pictures pictures we have and

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,529
Francois is one of the seven persons who

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,969
are at the way absolutely key in

00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:10,139
transitioning from object web to to w2

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:11,310
so along with Vallejo ban from orange

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,349
who's here

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,330
thank you brother for being here then

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:18,960
jump to mention jean-pierre barbarous

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,529
opal who will join us later today the at

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,789
the party and gelasio Bordeaux from

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:28,919
INRIA and those three literally

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,330
overlooked the supervised the the older

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,050
tradition and the launch of Ford ability

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,669
to I need to also of course to mention

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,419
John Callen a who's

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:43,710
in charge at the time dream I need to

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:45,240
mention also Christophe Nate and and I

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,189
need also to mention John and Stephanie

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,050
who were so I hope I'm not forgetting

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:54,659
anyone critical and who's going to hate

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,360
me for rest of my life but anyway I

00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,500
think those by the 7% I needed to

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,930
mention I took him by John Boehner

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,599
Stephanie this is a slide that we are

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,900
still using and that was designed in

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,849
July 2006 when we were working with EE

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,069
to trying to capture the essence of what

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:13,710
this new organization which was not

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,900
called to be too yet would become so

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,569
it's a code base that is developed by a

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,620
community in the framework of activities

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,819
all these runs smoothly because it's

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,129
under the auspices of an open-source

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,139
governance and we keep on independence

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,860
because I'm a members pay the fees and

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,930
it still that's the old of YouTube

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,770
pretty much of course with a little bit

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,110
more than that and launching at the

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,979
ability to so the name for the name the

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,199
name was the code name so it it was like

00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,300
object web to but then we could do it

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,900
and we kept objects do we to we launched

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,729
a contest for new names and eventually

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,330
everybody said okay well let's keep or

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:57,440
double YouTube

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,729
why not we got used to it talking about

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,509
contests we also launched the context a

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:07,409
context for logos so this is the log you

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,889
see here the logos that unity had and we

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:11,029
escaped

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,889
well never escape so we we now have a a

00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:17,310
logo as a vault but that was that was

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:20,750
quite funny and and and you have some of

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,520
the key documents the bylaws and the

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,199
official declaration and the official

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,199
publication and of course we had to have

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,690
a seal so you have we need to seal so we

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,949
have C so that's launching a w-2 from

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,430
the legal and making it happen for for

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:43,860
real and since then we've had 56

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:46,980
board meetings and we that involved some

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,480
more than 90 board members so talk about

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,220
open governance so it's not something

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,149
that has been

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:57,889
captured we have we've had our people

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,889
looking at the w2 looking at the account

00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,389
looking at everything and that's why I

00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,139
said the management team when we work

00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:07,639
just think you probably have 70 to 100

00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:10,040
people over looking looking over your

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,569
shoulder so we better be transparent and

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,579
by the way everything's on the website

00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:16,189
so if you spend an hour on the website

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,810
you should be able to find pretty much

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,680
everything and see if you don't find it

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,839
we'll publish it we've also conducted

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,810
what we now we host some 100 project and

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:32,120
we try to talk to talk about them so

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,610
looking back we've made organized over

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,910
1,000 presentations opens up

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,310
presentations at 160 events in 18

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,290
countries so that's pretty much what

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,230
we've done and to relate to the main

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,300
theme of the conference about challenges

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,129
in addressing mainstream market

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,449
you probably familiar with that curve

00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:56,480
that shows the number of users or

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,399
customers for a new technology starting

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,319
on the left with the innovators or the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,660
early adopters and then we'll be going

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,279
to the bulk of the market which we call

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,069
the mainstream market which is divided

00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,569
in between the early and the late

00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,339
majority of mainstream market and then

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,230
you have the loggers so when we launched

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,660
the w2 we were pretty much in the area

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,970
of the innovators we we didn't really

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:22,550
have to prove that much we were in the

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,279
world where you had those who ignored

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,629
and hated open source and those free

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,059
software and those who were already

00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,790
convinced and then we just had to be

00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,980
there and as they say for some websites

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,379
okay let's build it a little and they'll

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,709
come so we didn't really have to prove a

00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:41,809
very tangible we just had to be there

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:45,139
and our abilities were more intangible

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:47,329
and well we had some success but today

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,790
where we are which is addressing

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,250
mainstream ten years after some people

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,139
say open source as one but the cost of

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,350
winning is that we are now talking to

00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,360
people who are not open source advocates

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,939
or aficionados so we need to convince

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,930
them and we need to prove the value so

00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,120
now Zack Morris

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,520
show me the money let's see what's the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,310
ROI how'd it work make how do you

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,560
convince me because not just me I have

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,230
to convince my manager that excess rate

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,760
goes up all the chain so we need the

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,770
whole model the whole attitudes has

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,390
completely changed I'm not saying that

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,730
we did not have any discussions about

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:27,050
what was the value proposal for w2 at

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:32,300
the beginning but the the sense was more

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:35,180
that we had to be there and and 2017 now

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,800
we have to deliver something and the

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,630
service we're not really a service

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,190
company because if we were a service

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,839
company we might be in danger of

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,760
competing against our members and that's

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
a key rule we did not compete against

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,760
our members but we need to have some

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,649
support to the project and this support

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,240
is what is described I mean we call it

00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,890
the other to process and that's what you

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,450
described in the little brochure you

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:01,940
have in your bags and which is on four

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,459
pillars one is about technology we need

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,680
to drive the selection and the build up

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,959
of the code base along relevant

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,600
technologies then it's about community

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,910
we need to make sure that all projects

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,220
are run properly so it's community and

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,700
governance really then it's about

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,130
quality we must ensure and demonstrate

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,290
that this project of good quality the

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:30,080
technology is right so we provide the

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:32,959
tools for crisp quality and of course

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,970
it's not just wanting to build the

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,070
technology but we need to find the users

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,959
so we have to bridge between the

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,820
developers and the users and that's what

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,430
we call it delivery where that's why we

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,470
are implementing our marketplace so

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,810
that's what we are doing now so it's a

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:52,370
little bit different than it was before

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,220
and hopefully we building this on good

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,690
grounds we've opened the page of testing

00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,200
model for the ten years so I'm just

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,480
quoting a few here one of our morning

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,329
speakers Scientifics has rightfully

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,640
identified that we are it's a balancing

00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,570
act between free software for the sake

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,750
of ethical freedom and

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,260
and sharing and doing business so I know

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,930
that audible to us at this kind of

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,970
perception that is more why we were

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,230
called consortiums or business so it's a

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:29,710
bit we have to find our way there we

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,800
nevertheless are a platform now where we

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:35,230
support collaboration and work together

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,550
people we can work together we help our

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,860
a week driver we inspire summer users

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,500
such as a builder ballad to actually put

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,810
open source and center stage in their IT

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,980
strategy we even managed to teach a

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,520
thing or two to university professors

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,350
out there

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,810
so it probably means that we're not

00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:00,280
doing everything wrong so we may be

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:02,170
doing so a few things right and we I

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,270
know there is one thing that we lag is

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:09,130
the we're not as visible as some of our

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,160
great American counterparts but we

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,520
nevertheless are a powerful strength in

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,660
the first community we are recognized as

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,660
a innovator I think kind of visionary

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,180
precisely because we have we managed to

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,420
understand that or not manage we built

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,320
it with you on the fact that all the

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,970
ability to is about developing good code

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,710
collaboratively but also making a dent

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:40,540
in the software industry we are we have

00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,240
that is the European positioning which

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,930
is quite strong so we are European and

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,400
global and I like this one too because

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,870
Jim is the founder of OpenStack and

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:58,270
recognized that we we're one of the

00:14:52,870 --> 00:15:00,790
first partners and maybe maybe we we

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,580
can't it when they long stir what or was

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,140
OpenStack and we get support from all

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:10,770
over the world so of course we have a

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:13,960
Brazil has a place where we really have

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:16,330
friends and members and we have one

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,900
presentation from one of our members who

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,120
came all the way from Brazil and and I

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,120
will finish on this one so hopefully the

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,680
young technology and business maybe

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,810
they say in a very flowy way Chinese

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,980
friends is that to me make contribute to

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:40,540
more in future so here we go this is

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:43,149
other Bluetooth 10 years changes in

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,850
celebration but then it's also an annual

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:50,910
conference so I'm very pleased now to

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:54,130
invite on stage our next keynote speaker

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,160
if we can change the slides up there

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,759
Gabriel roof 80s or Gary fatties all

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,380
friends of owt - it's been the

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,550
presidents of the community and been a

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,560
long supporter for for 10 years now

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,810
little bit changes and engineering is a

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,230
very strong member of so thank you for

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,199
being here

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,520
Gabriela and the shop the floor is yours

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,460
thank you

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,460
