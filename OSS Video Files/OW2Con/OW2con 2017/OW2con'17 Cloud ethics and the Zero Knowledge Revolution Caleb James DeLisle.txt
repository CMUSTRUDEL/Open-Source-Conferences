Description: 
	Today webapps and cloud services are becoming more and more significant in our everyday lives. As a result we upload an increasing amount of our private information to the cloud and after it is uploaded, we lose control of how it will be used. Zero Knowledge is the revolutionary idea that cloud services can make themselves voluntarily ignorant of the content which they host. Webapps have traditionally avoided encryption because it is currently impossible to verify a webapp. You just have to trust that the webapp creator isn't serving you a special insecure version of the app. But if the webapp creator served everybody an insecure version, they would certainly be caught in the act. So although we cannot prove a webapp to be secure, we can prove that it is not built for mass data collection.

Zero Knowledge is about changing the discussion around cryptography from the stuff of spy novels to a very basic thing we all care about: How can we know that the services we are using are being ethical with our data.
