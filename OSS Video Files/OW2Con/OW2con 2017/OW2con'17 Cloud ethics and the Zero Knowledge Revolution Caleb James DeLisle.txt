Title: OW2con'17 Cloud ethics and the Zero Knowledge Revolution Caleb James DeLisle
Publication date: 2017-06-29
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	Today webapps and cloud services are becoming more and more significant in our everyday lives. As a result we upload an increasing amount of our private information to the cloud and after it is uploaded, we lose control of how it will be used. Zero Knowledge is the revolutionary idea that cloud services can make themselves voluntarily ignorant of the content which they host. Webapps have traditionally avoided encryption because it is currently impossible to verify a webapp. You just have to trust that the webapp creator isn't serving you a special insecure version of the app. But if the webapp creator served everybody an insecure version, they would certainly be caught in the act. So although we cannot prove a webapp to be secure, we can prove that it is not built for mass data collection.

Zero Knowledge is about changing the discussion around cryptography from the stuff of spy novels to a very basic thing we all care about: How can we know that the services we are using are being ethical with our data.

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,070
hello everyone I am caleb james de lisle

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,179
or de lille depending on your pure

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,449
American or French I am American but I

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,880
live here I'm the research manager at

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,550
xwiki and I work on the crypt bed

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,670
project this presentation is made with

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,289
crypt pad before creek bed I worked on

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,809
the CJ DNS project and I'm here today to

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,860
talk to you about the cloud and about

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,079
ethics now to start off I think we need

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,550
to define ethics and I'm going to upset

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,719
all the ethical philosophers here

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,670
because I'm going to give you a really

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,170
simple definition but for the purposes

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,350
of this discussion I think it's good

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,989
enough for me the definition of ethics

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,920
is the rules the mental programming the

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:58,440
the protocols that every citizen every

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,039
person needs to follow in order to for

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,250
society to function and so obviously

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,479
these rules are not really applicable to

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,760
geopolitics and they're not applicable

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,060
to like animals in the jungle and these

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,150
kinds of things so with ethics out of

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,890
the way let's talk about the cloud and

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,990
about open source so happy birthday ow2

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:26,700
it's been 10 years and things are

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:29,040
looking good I was born in 1987 so when

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,970
I was 10 years old I got my first Linux

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,299
computer and I grew up while open source

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,450
grew up um I was at Linux world 2000

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,729
because I had a good mentor and I was

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,579
there when Red Hat went public and when

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,560
abun 2 was being a very early pitch of

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:54,799
Ubuntu um and it's now 17 years later

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,009
and open source has one sort of sort of

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,170
C in 1995 software was made by companies

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,640
and it was sold to individuals and to

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,659
other companies and the software was the

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,520
property and it was delivered on Lee's

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,270
floppies or the CD ROMs and you weren't

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,950
supposed to copy them and today software

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,480
is still mostly made by companies

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,720
we have some contributors but it's

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,819
mostly made by companies and almost all

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,330
the software is given away for free and

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:27,540
now the property du jour has become the

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,470
data and what's interesting about this

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,720
is that despite the explosion of free

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,180
and open source software we have somehow

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,340
become more dependent on companies like

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,660
Google and Facebook than we had been

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,190
before you see in 1995 Microsoft

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,250
couldn't unilaterally shut you out of

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,970
your computer and today companies like

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,590
Facebook Apple and Google effectively

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,660
can now let's rewind a bit more the

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,140
Internet as we know it was created in

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,780
1982 as a US military research project

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,980
and this is the internet when it was 10

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,140
years old from there the stories were

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,640
told is that the military only cared

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,700
about the internet for its own internal

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,299
communications and the technology just

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,950
got out the door and it spread and the

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,230
hippies and hackers and everybody

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,299
started to use it and then tech

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,250
companies sprung up all around Silicon

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,940
Valley in order to make money while

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,459
changing the world and there was a loss

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,489
of privacy but it was an inevitable

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:39,660
sacrifice for the increasingly connected

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,489
world and the fact that today each one

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,579
of us is being watched catalogued and

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,340
recorded on servers in the USA through a

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:52,139
network designed by the US military well

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,190
that's just a happy accident now I want

00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,670
to tell you a little bit about how

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,590
venture capital works you see inside the

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,090
US and for people who are not from the

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,310
US this is something you don't know the

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:09,000
military intelligence industrial system

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,489
is massive if you know ten people then

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,489
like one of them the veteran one of them

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,500
is in active military two of them are

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,970
working for a defense contractor and

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,510
three of them are working for companies

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,750
that are supporting defense contractor

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,660
now there's a firm called Inc you tell

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,540
which invests on behalf of the sea

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,850
on lots of different companies which

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,330
make things that the intelligence

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,370
community uses we don't know whether

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,020
elements of the US military machine are

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,540
investing in big companies like Google

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,910
and Facebook but what we do know is that

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,400
there are people like Peter Thiel for

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,110
instance who serve dual roles they

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,660
provide services to the intelligence

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,080
community in his case through his

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,720
company Palantir and they've also served

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,810
as in his case as an early an angel

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,630
investor to Facebook now here's a graph

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,750
which you won't be able to read but this

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,790
is a graph of people institutions and

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,960
organizations and their social network

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,640
links involved in Facebook now Peter

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,060
Thiel is the little flower at the bottom

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:23,540
and you can see that in this graph and

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:27,120
you'll have the information afterwards

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,520
you see VC investment banks tech

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,460
companies intelligence companies and Ivy

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,670
League universities all interconnected

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,470
so given the blurry line between the

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,330
state and the investment banks and

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,850
between the intelligence and the tech

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,669
community just ask yourself for a moment

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,100
do you think that we're really all using

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:52,440
Google and Facebook just because all the

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,870
smart guides live in California now the

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,630
Internet and the cloud and Silicon

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,310
Valley is not the first thing to come

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,830
from California and take the world by

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,780
storm

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,890
after the world wars Hollywood came to

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,660
dominate cinema all around the world and

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,210
measures to protect domestic cinema by

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,580
various different companies against the

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,340
onslaught of Hollywood films coming out

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,330
every month they were treated as hostile

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,970
acts by Hollywood's Lobby the MPAA now

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,210
the State Department saw the MPAA as an

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:30,060
important strategic tool in promoting

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,070
American values and for them it was the

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,120
survival imperative but in the fight

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:39,960
against communism so they chose to see

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,020
any limitation in the spread of American

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,740
films as

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,280
unfair economic protectionism so

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,900
eventually Hollywood got their way and

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,669
the impact of American culture

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:57,250
especially on Europe is striking so you

00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:02,139
all know this guy but what you may not

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:04,629
know is that the the personification of

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,930
Santa Claus as a an old bearded man a

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:11,800
bearded fat man is actually creation of

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,099
the coca-cola company um I need not

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,069
remind you that cigarettes are all

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,620
coming from the United States but most

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:24,580
surprisingly Hollywood even has the

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:28,900
power to change facts and this one is

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:31,150
just beautiful in 1945 French people

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,770
were surveyed as to which country they

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,919
thought contributed the most to winning

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,050
the World War two and 57% said that it

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:44,409
was the USSR and 20% said the USA by

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:47,289
2004 the numbers were reversed 20% said

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:51,340
it was the USSR and 58 percent said the

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:55,240
USA and the number decreased a little

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,590
bit by 2015 but if you ask me who won

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,330
world war two I'll tell you it was

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,340
Hollywood now some people might take an

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,360
ethical position that this kind of thing

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,190
is that we shouldn't have a machine that

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,039
tells people what to think and eats

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,800
their data but as I said in the

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,800
beginning beware the ethics and

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,229
geopolitics should not mix and if we

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,599
want to be effective as European

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,150
open-source businesses what we should

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,099
think instead is what is the system of

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,319
ethics what is the system of rules

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:32,979
what is the system of norms that we can

00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,680
adopt which will allow us to thrive

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:40,959
within this system to extend the system

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:44,290
and to make it more democratic so China

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,750
has made a unilateral decision to just

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,380
block the American clouds so there's the

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,010
Great Firewall and people say well

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,030
that's a tool for repression but if you

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,270
look at it actual

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,920
um what it's blocking it's blocking

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,570
Google is blocking Twitter it's blocking

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,870
Facebook these are the big data

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,550
aggregators Europe has also passed the

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,420
stringent Privacy Protection Act which

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,710
will go into effect in 2018 but I'm not

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,460
sure that it will actually be enough

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,950
with machine learning and what we're

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,080
headed toward is a fragmented internet

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,190
but a fragmented internet is not going

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,140
to benefit anybody so the xwiki research

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,510
team and I have been working on a

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,480
different kind of cloud we're developing

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,330
a zero knowledge technology called crypt

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,760
bed so zero knowledge means that we use

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,610
cryptography on the client side in your

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,220
computer in your phone in your browser

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:45,340
to make sure that we the operator of the

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,310
cloud server cannot read the content

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,470
that you're typing zero knowledge

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,560
protects your sensitive data from

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,510
hackers it protects from cloud providers

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,390
that have gone bad or pivoted changed

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,060
their business model in it protects all

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,460
of us from the social fallout of single

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,810
entities that simply amass too much data

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,880
now some politicians think that this

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,830
end-to-end cryptography that's the

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,190
cryptography that allows zero knowledge

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:18,670
to work is a terrorism enabler and in

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,610
reality it probably is but that doesn't

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,220
matter we've had this debate 22 years

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,200
ago we had the debate about HTTPS

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:32,980
because military-grade HTTPS encryption

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:37,960
was not allowed anywhere except inside

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:40,270
the US until 1996 I think it was but

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,690
it's no less dangerous than it was in

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,880
1995 but it's become the foundation of

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,890
e-commerce and of online banking and of

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,630
pretty much everything that we do online

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:56,170
even that is using good old HTTPS

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,120
and nobody in their right mind would now

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:03,850
propose that we should go back to the

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:06,490
old days of 40 bit SSL and just like any

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,470
other technology if the technology is

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,810
right then banning it's not going to

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,120
make it

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,060
away it's just going to move the Rd to

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,850
another jurisdiction so it will decide

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,800
that somebody else becomes the winner

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:22,310
but this particular technology is one of

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,740
few things that can offer us a new deal

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:29,570
for cloud which America Europe and China

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,360
can all actually agree on so we stand at

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,900
a fork in the road Big Data machine

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,650
learning are here strong AI is just

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,529
around the corner

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,650
I predict and he who controls the data

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:45,350
will control the AI and he who controls

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:49,910
the AI will control just about

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,850
everything so data is power so

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,730
decentralization is democracy

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,260
so let us decentralize the data let us

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,610
decentralize the wealth that the

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:04,000
Internet has created let us go dark

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:12,620
thank you very much and

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,620
