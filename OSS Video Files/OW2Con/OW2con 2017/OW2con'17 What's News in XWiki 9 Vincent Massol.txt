00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,410
hi everyone

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,370
so I'm Vincent from xwiki I have to have

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,260
one is as a developer of the open source

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,480
project someone of the committers and

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,270
the other hat is as an CTO of the

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,130
company offering services on top of this

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,720
open source project so today we're going

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,939
to I'm going to show you in the 15

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,460
minute that's very fast a few of the new

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,500
features index wiki of course I had to

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,510
make a choice because that would be too

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,149
long 15 minutes

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,890
so the first how many of you know about

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,480
xvg I've heard about a quickie can you

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,239
raise your hands please so that's about

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,550
half of the room so just very quickly

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,489
it's a it's a tool that you can use to

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,550
create a collaborative intranet

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,219
knowledge bases documentation websites

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,789
even standard websites or actually any

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,710
anytime you have you need to collaborate

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,590
on content with several people and you

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,710
want to author content these people so

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,380
let's sum so my talk is just a demo will

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:12,119
let's let's dive directly into the demo

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:16,080
because we don't have much time so this

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:20,400
is how X wiki looks like if you download

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,380
it and install it you what what I'm

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,610
going to show you first is one of the

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,549
feature we've developed over the past

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,470
year which which we call nested pages so

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,689
this is a feature sponsored by Amazon so

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,729
Amazon has chosen X wiki as its intranet

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,799
and the baskets and they sponsor the

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,680
development of the ability to have pages

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,689
at the at any level so they have like 2

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,630
million pages with 18 levels of

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,250
hierarchies so they needed this and so

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,380
that's what we did so let's let's try to

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,060
let's create a new page for example from

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,810
here so create so let's call it on a

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,990
whole w2 cons for example let's make it

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,409
a blank page to start with and as part

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,360
of this work we've also integrated a new

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:06,899
editor and you WYSIWYG editor based on

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,739
CK CK editor and that's the need that's

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,880
the new editor so it's a standard editor

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,620
you can you can have a

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,870
and everything that's very that's pretty

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:22,120
standard you can drag and drop images

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:26,740
also you can resize the image actually

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,710
if I can get hold of here I hit here so

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,590
I've created a page here so now let's

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:36,520
imagine I want to do to move the page to

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,960
an existing location I can do so I can

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:44,020
preserve the links let's imagine now I

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,460
want to move that to for example the

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:52,180
sandbox space so I can do that and you

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,280
see now now we have a page the page that

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,480
is under another page so this is the

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,160
sandbox and if you look at the

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,960
navigation on the left we see that there

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,730
is another page and we can create

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,240
another page inside that page for

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,130
example it's a presentation one it's a

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,060
bit hard to type with one hand by the

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,920
way not obvious and I can use a template

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,250
for example I can use an article

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,270
template here and that would create a

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:24,820
new page based on this on some

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:28,420
predefined template presentation for

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,250
example la some for content this is just

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,890
to show you so this is showing also the

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,560
template feature at the same time and

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,990
now have three levels IV in the new

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,110
yorky there is the sandbox then le to

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:45,510
call a bit o W to code page and then the

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:48,220
presentation page so that's a that

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,760
that's a that's quite powerful and you

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,959
can go at any level you want okay the

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,020
other feature I wanted to show you

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,700
quickly is the the menu application that

00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,740
we found only next week e so this is a

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,330
way to customize your wiki imagine that

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,680
you want for example a menu at the top

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,230
here so I need to login as administrator

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:13,080
for doing that I was a simple user till

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,080
now so I've got an admin user in my wiki

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,370
ok I'm now administrator and you see

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,820
there's a there is an application called

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,860
menu that appears here at the top left

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,660
so I can create a menu for example let's

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,200
call it on the top menu

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,000
and okay there's a default we pop we

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,310
populate with some default content you

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,280
see it's actually you edited this as a

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:43,200
as a as a page but you can create a list

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,060
a list of items and you can you can put

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,180
anything you want for example as a link

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:54,510
to Hana know X we get out work for

00:04:48,180 --> 00:05:03,720
example here and I can create a link to

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:06,570
link to the link to URL for example okay

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,400
and then this menu can I can need to

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,320
decide where I want to display it so I

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,540
can displayed at the top after the page

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,220
header I can displayed the right panel

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,710
as the last panel so let's do as a page

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,360
header and the visibility for my current

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,460
user only for the whole wiki for

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,440
everyone in the wiki so let's do that so

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,100
you as soon as I've done that it is a

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,330
done at the top I have a menu that

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,210
corresponds to the the structure that

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,580
I've edited and I can I can make

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,310
modification or as much as I want and

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,080
that's pretty simple to do so this is

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,030
just showing one type of customization

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400
that's new that we've we've developed

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,410
recently and you see those panels on the

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,080
left and right while you can you can do

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,910
the same the same kind of thing so

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,350
another interesting thing is the ability

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,910
to to customize the look and feel so if

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,400
we go to the administration there is a

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,820
look and feel section here and we have a

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,910
notion of themes so by default we've got

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,440
a theme define but we can control a lot

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:10,980
of things like all the colors the fonts

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,890
different placement of things I can make

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,190
I can make changes on on on base colors

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,800
on anything and did this preview is

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:25,080
pretty nice because you can see you can

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,090
see alive actually what how it's going

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,160
to affect your wiki is here for example

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,020
let's change this color and you can see

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,410
here you can even navigate in Yuki and

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,010
see how it affects it okay let's not

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,310
save that

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:42,640
let's go back so now so these are basic

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,810
basic basic features now what I wanted

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,130
to show you was something a little bit

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,620
more advanced so we have the ability to

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,120
install extensions in the wiki so a

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,800
predefined extension that I've already

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,200
been published and I wanted to show you

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,120
one it's called the only office

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,600
extension and it's it's the ability to

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,820
directly create from within your wiki

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,760
Word Excel and PowerPoint presentation

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,060
in their in their format in the in the

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,770
Microsoft or liberal fees format it's

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,370
also the ability for you to attach any

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,350
of those files to wiki pages and be able

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,870
to edit them directly from the wiki so

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,850
why would you want to do that well as

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,360
you know the wiki pardon is actually to

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:30,490
move away from this type of documents

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,960
that are allow spread out in your emails

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,180
and everywhere and we want to have a

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,130
single place where everyone can see the

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,890
latest up-to-date information however as

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,520
a transition phase it's interesting to

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,950
be able to start with a wiki and do the

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,400
one place for all information but also

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,840
be able to integrate existing content

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,030
but in the while doing do your migration

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,140
to this new paradigm so I'm going to

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,940
demonstrate that and I'm going to

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,220
demonstrate the same time the ability to

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,560
install extension from with one click in

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,430
your wiki it's actually two clicks I

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,080
think so here here I can say install new

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,530
application I'm doing that because I'm

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,260
an admin so I can click on it and I will

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,060
go to the admin listing it's actually

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,080
gathering now all the extensions you can

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,870
find on internet actually on the loan

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,110
extension repositories I don't know if

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,210
the Wi-Fi is that good it normal it's

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:31,680
quite fast but I guess there's some

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,680
issues it should come it's a bit slow

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:45,310
okay five four three yeah okay so they

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,320
are in total there about six hundred

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,480
something extension that exists they're

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,750
not all to the same quality level there

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,130
are some

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,560
very good one there are some that are

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,420
not that interesting so we have a notion

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,910
of recommended extensions you see some

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,060
of them here I can search I can search

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,660
for only on the office for example it's

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,390
here

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,830
so I can install it it tells me what

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,100
dependency does that what will be

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:12,790
installed in my wiki I can continue to

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,940
install ok and it is installed so this

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,340
extension actually brings a new feature

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,100
in the attachment tab so if I go there

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,590
there are these two needs actually three

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,900
new buttons that exist so I can create

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,250
for example a new a new document from

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:33,100
Word document so let's call it test and

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:35,620
so I'm still in and finish on my wiki

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,940
and now I'm editing a new document with

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:43,240
all the the UI that you all used to and

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,040
then I can save and view and when I do

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,610
that it's actually saved as an

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,040
attachment in my in my wiki here and I

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,080
can I can later edit etcetera so I can

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,589
do the same with a spreadsheet and a

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,420
presentation so that's one that's

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,190
example of one extension that exists

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,990
there are lots you can have a blog

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:06,100
application the forum application

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,570
meeting manager etc they are plenty now

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,280
what's also a very interesting and

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,589
that's what differentiate xwiki from

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,130
other wikis is the ability to yourself

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,660
create new extensions or application

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,580
yogi and I want to demonstrate that very

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,610
quickly and I hope I can do it quickly

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,640
with one hand so in more application I

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,740
can create my own here create your own

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,740
so we're going to create as an example

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,839
some holiday request application for

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,270
example imagine you want to manage your

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,610
holiday request with index wiki so I

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:42,850
will call it holidays so what do we need

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:47,760
for Holi the application we need we need

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:52,150
the user and employee so I'm scrolling

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,370
call it employee what do I need a need a

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,390
date what for the start date of the

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:02,929
holiday request so start

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:10,170
I need a duration

00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:13,949
so for how many days what else do I need

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:18,959
I have is I need status because the the

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:21,089
employee will will request one but it

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,189
needs to be some manager to actually

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:35,819
validate it so I'm going to say pending

00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:40,129
and and approved prove and I'm going to

00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:40,129
remove the default choices that I had

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:48,839
okay and I need a I need a manager

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:53,339
so let's take another user okay and

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,579
that's it so now now actually I can I

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,350
can specify the icon of the application

00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:00,389
in which space in which part of the wiki

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,569
this application is available by default

00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,970
is to the whole wiki and I can

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,739
and this little wizard will will prepare

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,809
your homepage for this application so I

00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:14,549
can have a some description the blah

00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:16,049
blah and I can I can under homepage is

00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:17,819
going to generate there will be a table

00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:20,369
listing all the auditor requests so I

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:23,939
can customize that a table I can put the

00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:28,379
fields that I have created like employee

00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:31,410
start curations status let's put them

00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:36,709
all and the manager there's some default

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,709
one that I can actually remove or remove

00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:42,269
let's keep it like this and done and

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,639
here so that's that's done now you see

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,259
on the Left menu there is no a new

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,720
application in my wiki called holidays

00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,039
anyone coming in you can click holidays

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,569
while I'm logged in as admin year of

00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,600
credit doesn't mean so have some option

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:59,039
like editing editing entries etc but if

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,499
you're standard users you will only be

00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:05,369
able to add new entries so let's add

00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:07,679
annually the request okay that says my

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:12,119
long we can put a date or whatever you

00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:15,340
want as a title so employee let's see

00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:20,620
okay as me I'm going to take holidays

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:24,310
working tomorrow and for 30 days because

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,960
I like holidays pending a news mine

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,550
manager let's say I don't have many

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,050
users and this week it intersects the

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,690
administrator of the week is my manager

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,400

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,650
menu here and now there is there is an

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,300
entry here so we can create a lot of

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:45,940
entries they can be filtered this those

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,920
those those fields are filters and yeah

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,900

go back and you can edit so that my

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,600
manager can edit the page change to I

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,670

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,760
it cetera and that's it that's all I
