Title: OW2con'17 10 years of Open Source with OW2 Gabriele Ruffatti
Publication date: 2017-06-28
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	The story of open source at Engineering Group started by networking with international communities. The first one was ObjectWeb in 2005, followed by the collaborative foundation of OW2 in 2007. I still remember the final preparation workshop in Rome, in November 2006 … it’s been a long time. This coming speech won’t be just a celebrative talk: it will introduce both a reflection about lessons learned by one of OW2 founding members and a look at future prospects and challenges of open source in the era of digital innovation, aiming at keeping the spirit of the ground values of open source alive over time. In 2010 I wrote the paper “Which open source software for the current decade? Five questions for the future”. It’s now time to answer to its final question: “Which approaches and real opportunities do we need to adopt in order to lead the business and technological innovation towards a new knowledge-intensive way of producing and living?”. Trust, one of the open-source key-words, is part of the answer: progress is not possible without trust, in the digital world.
