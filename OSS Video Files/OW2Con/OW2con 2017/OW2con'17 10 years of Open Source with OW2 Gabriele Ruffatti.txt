Title: OW2con'17 10 years of Open Source with OW2 Gabriele Ruffatti
Publication date: 2017-06-28
Playlist: OW2con 2017
Description: 
	The story of open source at Engineering Group started by networking with international communities. The first one was ObjectWeb in 2005, followed by the collaborative foundation of OW2 in 2007. I still remember the final preparation workshop in Rome, in November 2006 … it’s been a long time. This coming speech won’t be just a celebrative talk: it will introduce both a reflection about lessons learned by one of OW2 founding members and a look at future prospects and challenges of open source in the era of digital innovation, aiming at keeping the spirit of the ground values of open source alive over time. In 2010 I wrote the paper “Which open source software for the current decade? Five questions for the future”. It’s now time to answer to its final question: “Which approaches and real opportunities do we need to adopt in order to lead the business and technological innovation towards a new knowledge-intensive way of producing and living?”. Trust, one of the open-source key-words, is part of the answer: progress is not possible without trust, in the digital world.

[Music]

00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:13,950
Thank You Sadiq Samar for your effort to

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:19,529
order to community till now I apologize

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,920
because my speech the title is ten years

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,160
of open source video W but I'm not going

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,500
to add a celebrating speech because what

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,420
I've learned to in an open source

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,930
community is to look at the future not

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,850
to look at the past so I'm not a

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,010
visionary but I want to go

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:45,719
what can order to do in the future but

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:48,379
back to you know days as I remember 2006

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,870
when we met in Paris Brussels and

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:54,960
finally in Rome to prepare the loans of

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,859
a double - then we start with four seven

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,370
submitting a lot of enthusiasm and

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:07,460
expectations about expectation was the

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,960
reasons to be a member of W to learn how

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,180
the open source community operates from

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,090
the inside first of all to enter wide

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,729
network of accountants to act in a

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,270
multivariate international context and

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,970
to be enact a real actor in the open

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,040
source ecosystem and grow in owns

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:32,610
reputation do you remember a lot of

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:36,540
activities initiative projects balancing

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:42,110
the European and Chinese community the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,000
effort to open local or debated chapters

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:51,439
some have been filled some have been

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,750
successful some fields but the internal

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,920
order - awareness grow over time and

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,320
also reputation at the end we are a

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,200
community would fundamental European

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:10,679
roots and during this journey I met

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,970
various actors whereas type of people of

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,180
course optimist pessimist

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:21,030
some rarest we also usually need some

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,510
really some opportunist some ice a

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,090
Napoleon's I'm not here to name names

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,780
but you can think who can be a Napoleon

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,650
in France and also naive candid and

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,920
passionate people fashion is key in open

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,090
source because remember and also our

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:48,960
life arts are better or more important

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:51,150
than mines after 10 years we have a lot

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,270
of very new friends and some of them

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,310
want to celebrate now the 10th

00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,889
anniversary of Oh W

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,889
[Music]

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:34,170
so some greatest firm özkan oh sorry and

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,560
after ten years we reach the first age

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,019
what is owed up to now it's a mature and

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,140
lively community with a clear vision of

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,209
the future all we usually try to have a

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,019
clear vision of the future that is the

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,900
reason of this conference today the

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:55,500
community that lead projects to market

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,700
awareness that's preserving the spirit

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,500
of open source and it's the main

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,319
important thing is a community of

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,810
friends what's you need for engineering

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:12,150
or other members we have achieved open

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,859
source awareness of time competence

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:21,840
leadership and international reputation

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:25,500
for our projects for engineering spec OB

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,280
is that now is rebranding in OS or other

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:33,600
projects of the members

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,880
lesson learned sorry microphone now open

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,300
circuit path not a destination we have

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,240
two very close the microphone okay open

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,789
source is path not a destination it

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,000
revenge relationship business dynamics

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:51,810
it give us to a wide network of contacts

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,979
so we don't skip to the end of the path

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,440
work the path it means take the

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:02,220
leadership introduce actionable

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:06,139
activities be agile give unjustified

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:10,860
tangible results be a driver of change

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:17,520
is not for free to walk the path you

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:20,400
must do these things but expect rest

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,950
resistance to cultural change now

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
nevertheless commit people to make

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,270
things happens because people

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,449
does open by themselves and remember

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,629
that quality benefits what's in it for

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:40,550
us are more variable than personal

00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:43,460
benefits what's in it for me let's have

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:47,449
a look now at what's happening in the

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:52,069
world digital transformation digital

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:55,780
transformation is about neil new

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:59,720
challenges first of all technological

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:04,599
disruption in workplaces it's a long

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:08,440
time that is so a very nice movie here

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:11,330
where the main actor fall in love with

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,240
the operating system because it was a

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:21,080
succeed operating system in this film

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:24,159
you can see it's probably 2010 probably

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,449
later it's a film with a lot of

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:31,069
expectation for the future and now

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:34,250
something is happening you can see self

00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:39,830
repairing codes in distributed system we

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:43,210
can see voice-enabled everywhere we can

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:51,380
see autumn autonomous driving car and

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:55,340
these caused less effort of people in

00:06:51,380 --> 00:07:00,740
workplaces are also of IT people new

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:04,219
challenges of course let's see one

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,469
example that we can see in italy and

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:10,659
recently in France however it's

00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,659
replacing creative designers

00:07:17,480 --> 00:08:20,580
[Music]

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:24,330
is not adverse I see for the tail of

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:29,490
course but is that to say how I grits

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:34,979
are in many many different topics are

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:37,200
redefining the digital transformation so

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,430
these are transformation is something

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,630
very Neil providing challenges but also

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:50,070
uncertainty and lots of confidence some

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:53,279
thoughts about infrastructures you know

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,370
that ID users look for fully integrated

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,250
and simple to use products open-source

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,040
is key for this but probably usability

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,519
integration are more important so we

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,690
don't need more and more new open source

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:13,620
projects just slightly different but we

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:17,250
need to work on the layer to work on the

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:20,579
AP is to work on the protocols to make

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,880
or to develop new open source projects

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:27,649
and we must remember that if we fail

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,130
probably we can be enslaved by

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,380
integrated infrastructure

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,940
infrastructures in the cloud and we are

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,680
seeing this trend digital transformation

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,100
this is a transformation ask for a

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,579
change of means to approach the new

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:47,579
data-driven culture is a couple of year

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:53,670
that the work in big data and algorithms

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:55,740
and I know what it means we are seeing

00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:00,600
more and more connected people and

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:03,329
objects that our phase is with standard

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,630
security and privacy and the digital

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:08,970
business business the digital business

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,540
demands opportunity oriented initiative

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,079
bottom of experimentation data discovery

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,149
agile development and immediate use

00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,880
academic and box fabless instead of

00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,430
traditional event conference inspiration

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,630
innovation tactical responsive approach

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:30,970
things are changing

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:33,519
from the beginning just a couple of is

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:39,459
intellectual property in open-source we

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:42,730
know what it is it's about a sharing of

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:46,720
software code it's the software release

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,709
dilemma to share or to protect to open

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,930
or to close if you look at our grains

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:56,019
people data analysts and those are

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,850
providers know that auguries include

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:03,850
both the data model that is very IP

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,730
potential IP greater property and also

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:11,350
the code that that's why they are not so

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:14,380
keen to share so there is a lot to do to

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,009
learn from of a source again another

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:22,060
issue is digital ethics digital ethics

00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:25,360
is becoming a crucial team we can define

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,639
digital ethics as a system of values and

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,100
moral principles to conduct digital

00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:35,350
interaction among people business and

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,250
things let's go deeper if you will look

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:43,360
at algorithms a great reputation can be

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,990
biases they embed traditional and new

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,339
evils of social discrimination

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,680
we have many example in literature for

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,500
instance a computer program for initial

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,110
screening of job Africans used

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,189
information from applicants form which

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,470
continues no reference to that Nissa t

00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:09,069
no direct reference but you can explore

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,399
with data and the program was found to a

00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:15,939
very discriminate for interviews female

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,569
and ethical minorities United States

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:23,230
same Athens with the credit score for

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:25,720
milked gays payments and the issue is

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,220
that these arguments are general

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,620
generally black boxes deep learning and

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,779
artificial intelligence deep learning is

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,750
a technique that is emerging in that

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,350
analysis is creating computer system we

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,830
don't fully understand

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:48,270
and so a responsible answer is to design

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:51,300
for fairness diversity transparency and

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:57,000
neutrality a lot of learn from open

00:12:51,300 --> 00:13:00,810
source in this field one more example we

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,320
can say the tragedy of algorithmic

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:07,460
Commons when we give intelligence to

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:14,010
surviving car we must give intelligence

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:15,720
to the Hagrid's that can be ok probably

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,570
sometimes have to take decision

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:23,430
involving humans let's see an example -

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,320
the moral machine a platform for

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,330
gathering a human perspective on moral

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,030
decisions made by machine intelligence

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,130
such as self-driving cars we show you

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,620
moral dilemmas where a driverless car

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,480
must choose the lesser of two evils such

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,570
as killing two passengers or five

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,490
pedestrians as an outside observer you

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,860
judge which outcome you think is more

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,750
acceptable you can then see how your

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,270
responses compare with other people if

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,490
you're feeling creative you can also

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,820
design your own scenarios for you and

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,650
others to view share and discuss moral

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,820
machine is a project by the scalable

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,280
cooperation group at the MIT Media Lab

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,260
ok around the season that self-driving

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,260
car can take when the break is pray you

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,440
for instance could be keep going and it

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,330
the per day pedestrians and saving all

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,040
the puns of the passengers inside the

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,590
car or go crash to a barrier affecting

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,130
all the passengers is an ethical and

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,620
moral dilemma but a decision taken by an

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,010
algorithm and moral machine as you can

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,870
see is a crowdsourcing platform

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:35,610
collecting answer decision from people

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:38,370
we so far we have more than 5 million of

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:42,270
the season ticket by 1 million more

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,430
people discussion is open and we need

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,460
time to get this far recent discussion

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,760
but it's looking for what happens when

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,010
we give power to the agreeance the other

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,010
driven culture means

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,230
a Chism insert time ago I was at the

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,660
garden briefing and you know how much

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,870
cotton is closed to open source and the

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,320
garden analyst firm said that we must

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,260
replace the traditional words with very

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,230
new words the word see worship overt

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,080
ownership facilitation over control

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,690
sharing over securing creation of a

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,860
governance headaches over legalities and

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:28,440
you officers guys come up with something

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:33,090
new here trust Trust is key for the

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,280
future we have no progress with their

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,800
trust

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,800
we know that sharing data sharing

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,800
artifacts give more value to these data

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,170
these artifacts relationship are based

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,440
on trust network based on trust there is

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,540
no sharing without trust so the real

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,180
question for the future is not if we

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,880
have to trust someone or something but

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,870
what the trustworthy threshold we can

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,870
accept and we have one more question for

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,630
the future if you remember the moral

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,660
machine projects the ethical dilemma

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:16,260
that is a social dilemma so here the

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:18,960
question is what's the trade-off what's

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,850
the role of open-source the role of a

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:27,900
source we can see using two old Greek

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:32,850
words ettus first one is letters it is

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:36,270
how you live how you act is about your

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:40,290
reputation is key value in open source

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:43,380
the second one is partes I already said

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:48,180
that hurts are more important than Minds

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:52,830
all embraced by transparency again a lot

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:56,550
to do a lot to learn from open source in

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,260
2010 I wrote this paper which open

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:03,090
source software for the current decade

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:06,630
five questions and it's now time to give

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:11,150
the answer to the five question that

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:14,790
certain these speeds and first answer is

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,339
give people vision people ask vision

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,390
people need a vision you must give them

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:25,010
a vision is more important rule for the

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,890
open source community second answer is

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:33,500
considering that technical comment must

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:37,260
be balanced with the creative insights

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,990
we must learn people about humanities

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:45,270
here a great role in school education

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:47,580
but also in the cultural roots we must

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,020
encourage people to trust the people to

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,970
be free of charge

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:56,100
give the continent something like this

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:58,710
to be empathetic to embrace love humans

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,830
not algorithms or software of ethical

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:06,060
abilities and let me say that here order

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:11,180
to at the European community with strong

00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,180
cultural roots have a great role in this

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm going to the conclusion and I'm

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,190
sorry for friends people that probably

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,290
know this but it's time to disclose my

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,440
real approach to digital transformation

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,440
MA

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,809
Oh

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:42,170
Emma Emma

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:42,170
[Music]

00:18:44,410 --> 00:19:01,280
Mr okay it's finally after seeing a lot

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,530
about digital cultural ethics and

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,940
something that is the transformation

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,120
this is my real approach to this

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,450
transformational that y-type to me to

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,560
give room to younger people and I've

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,840
left all my roles in recently inaudible

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,820
to as a representative engineering and

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,270
this is my last speech as a

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,410
representative of engineering but this

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,290
is my legacy

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,380
to engineering and that's why

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:34,450
engineering is happy now to celebrate 10

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,450
years of open sort of Oh W

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:45,990
