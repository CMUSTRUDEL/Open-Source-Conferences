right well good afternoon everyone thank

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960

so this is the second in the series of

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
open research webinars that are

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,679
organized between uh

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,480

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,520
then there is this call for presentation

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
for

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,879
an event held by the eclipse foundation

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720

that you have on the screen

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,120
and of course there is will be

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
another open research webinar which will

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
be held

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,680
on june 1st that philip will announce at

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,319
the end of this

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
of this session

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
so what are um open source organizations

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
doing with

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
uh collaborative research projects well

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
um

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
we we know that open source is a

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,760
fantastic vehicle for collaborative

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,920
research it helps us avoid

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
having to deal with a complicated and

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,120
costly ip

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,760
ip intel property negotiations so

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,319
an open source creates a common ground

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
for

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
different partners to work together and

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
open source organizations such as the

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,080
eclipse foundation and

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,680
audw2 are here to provide these common

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,640
resources

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
that will enable partners to work

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
together

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
in a neutral environment so that neutral

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
environment that we provide

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,319
includes an infrastructure for open

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,400
collaboration

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,200
usually it has a a a git ripple

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
wikis mailing lists uh everything that

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,720
uh

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
parties need to cooperate on uh in

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,159
research

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,159
we also uh act as um

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,720
this emission partners that's the term

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
in this eu funded

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
project destination partners so we help

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,439
uh project

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,120
reach out outside of the scope of

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:03,360
the the partners and uh become

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,040
public become known become visible

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
towards the open market so that's what

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
we call ecosystem development

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
then of course since uh uh the eu

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,159
european commission

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
is ask really asking that code be

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,079
available

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,479
as open source software we have

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
experience and best practices to help

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
you

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,960
implement uh open source uh software

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
uh publishing software and the open

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
source licenses properly

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,880
and implement the best governance the

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
best practices in open source governance

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
it's not exactly like working in the

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
totally proprietary environments

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
there are some best practices that are

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,759
worth knowing about

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
and the fourth uh stage is uh well we

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
help you manage your ip

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
uh in this respect the exit foundation

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,440
is more

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,000
uh uh is better organized if i can say

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,720
more directive whereas odu is more

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
liberal

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
so we have a greater flexibility in

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,600
licenses where the

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,440
exit foundation provides more rigor in

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,440
managing the iep so with all that we

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,000
we represent the platform upon which

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
partners who have not nothing in common

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
who even may

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
compete against each other can work

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
collaboratively and develop

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,000
the open source software so the outcome

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
of the collaborative research project

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
has to be some out open source project

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,120
uh operational software can

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
even be open data and be published and

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
having said that

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,240
we as open source organizations can hold

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,440
this uh this outcome these results and

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,440
that does not stop all partners to

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
on top of that for that develop their

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
own uh commercial offerings

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,039
even they can even be proprietary

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
extension of

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
of what has been developed within the

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
framework

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,960
of the uh research the project so that's

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
the the rationale

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,560
behind uh uh developing um

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,680
well research and developing research

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
software

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,600
and open source licenses leveraging the

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,800
resources and the experience and

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,120
and what can offer the open source

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,520
organizations such as transaction

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
so that explains what we do with we are

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,199
doing here

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,319
and we are very happy to um to organize

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,440
to jointly organize

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,479
this uh webinar on open research

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,319
webinars

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,800
and uh that enable us to showcase

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,400
each time a couple of projects so the

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,759
first project this afternoon

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,960
is a decoder

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,160
and decoder is a

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,520
an environment for developers that

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,560
enables developers to quickly understand

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,360
uh what's

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
in a project to quickly get proper

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
information

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,599
in a project and decoder also helps make

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,039
this information verifiable

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,240
so it's a complement to the almost your

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,280
preferred development environment

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,639
that helps increase your productivity

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,080
and also speed ups the onboarding

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,680
of new uh developers or new maintenance

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,960
on the given project

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,599
so without further ado um i'm handing

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,319
over

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:34,080
uh to virgil prevosto from the

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:37,280
caa or list ca so it's a research

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,400
organization attached to the french cea

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,680
and vegeta is the scientific lead of

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,240
the decoder project so now i'm going to

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,720
unshare my screen so that virgil can

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
take over

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,599
okay so thanks cedric for the

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,199
introduction and

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,400
good afternoon everyone thank you for

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,400
attending this webinar so indeed

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
i'm a researcher at cls

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:15,280
mostly developing the pharmacy

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
source code analysis tool and i will

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,759
present you

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,039
the decoder project as

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
cedric just said

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:32,240
so basically this is an age 2020 project

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,839
that started a bit more than

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,599
two years ago so we are basically in

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,599
the final year of the project

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:47,360
and the main the main goal of

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,480
decoder is to provide

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,160
some kind of unified platform or unified

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,640
database

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,360
where you can store and retrieve

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,800
basically any kind of information that

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,720
may be useful

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,680
during some

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,080
some part of the software development

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,720
and more generally the software

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
life cycle

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,120
basically the idea is really to

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,360
[Music]

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,160
to be able to provide

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,040
for useful information for all kind of

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
stakeholders

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,000
so in the project we focused on

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,519
three main roles namely

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,519
developers people who

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
who are writing code reviewers

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,680
people who will validate the work of

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,360
developers and the maintainers that

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,360
may come a few months or a few

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,920
years later and we'll have to try to

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
understand what all this is about

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,040
basically the project

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,160
gathers seven partners

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,800
the coordination is done by

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:16,399
technicon and the technical work

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,839
is centered around two main

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
kind of tools first

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,279
software engineering tools so for

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,440
design analyzing

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:34,399
and proving code or testing code

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,040
on the one hand and on the other end

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,640
natural language processing tools which

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,279
we hope will

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,720
help us extract the valuable information

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:53,040
from documents

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,880
in order to provide more

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,040
structured and more formal

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,880
specifications for the analysis

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,360
tools and in order to

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
propose

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,560
a good suitable methodology of use of

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:16,160
decoder we also have so first

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:20,000
methodological work going on

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,040
work on a user interface that will

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
enable

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,519
users make the best

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,079
usage of the tools and

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,760
of course a set of use cases to ensure

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,240
that

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
what we propose is

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,920
[Music]

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,920
indents something that is practically

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,240
doing

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,880
so in decoder speech as

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
the main this main database where you

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,079
can

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,560
store everything is called

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,560
pkm for persistent knowledge monitor

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,240
and it's basically a document oriented

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
database

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:14,560
mongodb not to name it

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,639
through which all tools that are

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:25,040
involved in the project

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:28,000
interact it goes from as

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,800
the tools the analysis tools such as

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,079
pharmacy

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
and open gmail so francie for cnc plus

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,839
plus

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:42,000
open gmail from java our tester

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,000
for testing

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,839
on the nlp side

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:52,560
[Music]

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,680
we have basically two tools

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,600
that will interact with the pkm

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
the knowledge extractor which is meant

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
to

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,480
extract information from

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:10,560
natural language documents and

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,519
a knowledge formalizer that should help

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,279
user provide formal specifications from

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,959
the information that has been

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:24,399
extracted otherwise

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,399
uh we hope also to use the uml

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,639
on the on the model side

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
and uh

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,560
on the the other way around also to be

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
able to generate some

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,519
some documentation from the the code

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,519
itself you know

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
to provide

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,440
a better more easily understandable view

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,320
for the

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,320
for the end user

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,440
rather than going through the code

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,360
finally the last point is to be able to

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,240
take advantage of

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,920
all this the information given by all

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,800
these tools

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,800
through an ide

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,399
so there's one that is currently under

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,079
development

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,079
in within the project but we also hope

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
to be able to interface with of course

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,760
existing

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:35,680
id in the in the future

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,480
everything goes through json schemas so

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,920
that

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
communication should not be too

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:45,519
difficult at this

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:49,040
at this level

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,079
to give a little bit more details

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,480
on the architecture of the the tools

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,839
so at the earth of the tools there's

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,959
this mongodb

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,320
database which store everything

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:08,160
and the preferred way of communication

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,079
is through a classical

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,880
rest server whose interface

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:20,639
is described through open api

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,450
documents so that it's quite easy to

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
generate

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,320
[Music]

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,920
bindings for our columns

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,480
wide the variety of languages so that

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
the communication is not not that

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
difficult

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
either for the tools within the project

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,720
and

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,959
hopefully for external tools

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,639
as well there are also direct

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,839
ways to to interact with the pta

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,440
once one prefers that but

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,320
it was rather the rather the rest of the

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
early experiments

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,120
with with the ptm and nowadays

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,560
it's it's preferred to

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,040
to use this more standard way of

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
doing it

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,040
so regarding natural language processing

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,880
which is uh

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,079
at the earth of decoder

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,199
the idea is to go both ways so

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:33,040
on the only one and

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:37,519
starting from sorry

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,480
starting from or pdf or word documents

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,000
or

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,759
comments within the code

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,040
bug reports and and so on and

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,839
be able to see

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,120
the correspondences with the symbols

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,240
that are used

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,440
in the code in order to be able to

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
see what is related to which function

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,400
and which

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,240
which modules when

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,319
some paragraph of the documentation is

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,640
is concerned

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:16,240
so that we we can more easily

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,360
relate documentation and

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,520
encode and hopefully be able

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,520
to

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,120
to extract formal specifications that

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:33,520
could be given to analysis tools

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,880
from this documentation realistically we

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,039
hope rather to be able to assist users

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,760
in writing such specifications

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,480
rather than generating it completely

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,480
automatically

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,799
similarly we also hope to be able to

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:57,120
provide some categorization of

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,360
code patterns in order to

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,640
again semi-automatically extract

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,640
valuable information

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,520
from from the code itself a first

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:15,840
application of that

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,840
being to propose

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,840
to to spot identifiers that

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,840
might have been misspelled

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,280
and proposed a correction to to the

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,799
developers

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,440
in order to to try to fix

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,440
some some issues that way

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,919
finally the last ingredient of the

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
project is what is called the abstract

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,120
semi-formal models

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,280
well the idea is to have some kind of

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,200
graphical language

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,240
kind of uml sequencer grants so to say

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,440
which let users describe the effects of

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,840
some functions on the data structures

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,559
that

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,559
are involved typically list or trees

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,640
are more more complex structures

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,320
in so in a graphical way and to be able

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
to

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,320
[Music]

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,919
animate this these diagrams

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,120
to obtain some kind of graphical

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,240
debugger to

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,440
to play with with the program in a

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,280
in an abstract way

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,240
again we hope to be able to use

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:48,080
the the tools from decoder to have

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,440
a way to semi-automatically generate

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
these diagrams either from the

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,640
documentation

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
or

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,080
and start playing with with

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,720
so currently this is the first

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,480
draft of the sfm

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,120
language which is understood by all

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,600
tools and a few extensions

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,600
that are specific to some some of them

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,799
plus conversion tools

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,799
from documents to 2asfm

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,880
it's currently a prototype decoder

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,880
frontend which

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,039
is a andros mozilla base and should work

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,880
on

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:40,799
any browser it's under easy development

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,080
and we hope to be able to have a demo in

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,440
in a few weeks now

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
basically we have for now basic support

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,760
for the main

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,880
analysis tools and nlp tools

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,799
that can feed the the pkn or retrieve

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:04,240
documents from from it so to conclude

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:07,360
currently the main goal is to finish

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,640
the api of the the ptn so

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,200
most of it is is done now but there are

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
still some

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:21,280
some functions that are that are missing

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,880
work on the nlp training to be able to

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,799
extract more valuable information from

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
from them and finish the

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,679
development of the client externally

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,919
uh it might be interesting to explore

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,640
the possibility to have

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,440
an interface with existing tools so for

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,799
instance

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,919
since we're here

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,200
instead of the decoder

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,200
homemade client

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,400
also to propose

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,120
an interface with a

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,320
the possibility to have standard queries

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,039
language such as

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,440
language server protocol which is widely

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
used in

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,640
ideas it

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,919
does not make sense for all the

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,039
functionalities exposed by the pgn but

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,919
for many of them so it would be

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,159
interesting

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,520
for that and finally to

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,880
have some beta testing campaigns

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,840
outside of decoder so the first one

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,400
on the doctor's two sfm tools that is

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
scheduled

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:45,840
and if the world became stack is

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,960
mature enough for the second semester of

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,120
2021 we hope to be able to

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
offer it for better testing as well

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,520
okay thanks for your attention this

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,520
this concludes what i wanted to say but

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
i will be happy to answer some questions

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,840
and

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,960
if you want to have further information

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,400
you can reach us by

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,919
many many ways yeah i'm i'm

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
really very pleased to introduce our

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
next speakers antonio quint from

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
trialog and got samuel martin from

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,840
universitat

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
uh politica

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,320
uh antonio is the ceo and confronter of

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
trialog

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,480
he has more than 30 years of experience

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
in the field of cyber physical system

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
and iot

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,679
he was coordinator of numerous national

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,279
and european projects

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,440
including pdp foreign and he's active

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,279
uh he's active in sterilization on the

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
iot security and data protection

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,720
and is also the editor of several iot

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
standards

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
last at least antonio has a master

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,640
degree on harvard from artboard

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,240
university an engineer degree

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,159
from michael central paris um

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,159
you have we have also yap samuel who is

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,840
a researcher from the university head of

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,559
madrid

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,480
and his research work focus on different

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,440
categories of non-functional software

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
and service

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,799
requirements especially on the

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,039
categories of

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,720
accessibility and privacy the

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,960
observability scientific and technical

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,919
leader of pdp 4e

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
he participated to also civil as a

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,880
european

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,400
project and national and private

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
research project

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
and the result from his research have

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,080
been applied in collaboration with

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,919
private companies

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,840
to fields like their communication

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,480
banking and financial services social

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,120
network transportation etc

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
so antonio yep samuels thanks for

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,840
accepting your our invitation and the

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,840
floor is yours

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
thank you philip uh thank you to the

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,200
eclipse foundation

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,360
uh for inviting us to this uh

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,919
webinar as uh philip explained uh

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,200
we in fact the three of us because

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,480
felipe is not an author of this

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,600
presentation but

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
he's also helping us in this project and

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,480
in the community that

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,640
we are trying to to create um

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,000
the theofars are working in the pdp-40

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,240
project uh this uh

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,520
european funded project funded by the

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,320
european commission

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,760
but uh our goal today is not to focus so

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,559
much on pdp free

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,279
but uh on what goes beyond and what goes

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,279
beyond

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:35,200
is this uh privacy by mobile community

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,279
that is mentioned here um

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
uh by the way can you please confirm

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,080
that you can see my screen because i

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
have the

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,320
participants list to the right hand side

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,320
and it's maybe blocking the

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,150
you can see we can see it okay

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,229
uh so

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,229
[Music]

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,640
i will start with this slide

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,200
which wonders whether privacy and data

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,720
protection should be an engineer's job

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,760
and spoiler the answer is that yes

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,200
it should here we have

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,840
several articles several posts

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
from different blogs and engineering

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
journals

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,240
including inspection which is the most

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,120
well-known journal from the largest

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
electrical

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,720
and electronic engineers association

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,880
so in summary they say that yes that

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,520
private in particular gdpr which is

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,159
european regulations or data protection

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
should be

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
a matter of engineers because they are

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
responsible

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,679
for carrying out the work for creating

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,799
the the system

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,559
and in the end if they uh don't

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,039
don't think about privacy data

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,200
protection who will do that

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,279
we cannot just uh release the

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
responsibility to lawyers

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,799
and with uh that idea in mind we created

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,400
the pdp free project

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,000
which tries to introduce the legacy

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
the existence private and data

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
protection methods that exist from

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,279
previous results

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
that are out there but we cannot be

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,799
systematically

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
applied uh we tried we have tried to

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,919
introduce them

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
into the mainstream software and system

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,240
engineering practice

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,799
uh by creating a set of privacy and data

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,039
protection

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,640
engineering methods and tools not only

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,320
methods and tools

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,080
but we have also provided a set of or we

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,440
are providing a set of knowledge bases

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,919
uh demonstrators in two domains uh

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,799
targeting uh energy and connected

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
vehicles

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,600
and also we are well the tools

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,720
by the way uh include well-known tools

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,960
in the eclipse community

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
uh which are for instance providers for

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,120
modeling open search for assurance

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,279
this is a risk management tool which

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,399
doesn't have yet any logo so we put

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,360
there the logo of the project where it

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,120
came from and uh in the end we want to

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
make them available to the

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,240
to the community uh as mostly open

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,399
source projects

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,880
so that they can as i said apply this

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,600
practice this established practice from

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,279
the private

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,520
data protection research into daily

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,799
activities into daily use tools and

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
methods

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,840
uh the approach that we are following in

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,840
our

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,880
development is that of model driven

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,120
engineering

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,640
uh model driven engineering brings to

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,399
software and maybe

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
you can be familiar with that or maybe

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,080
it sounds a bit uh

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,440
far from your practice but it's easy to

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
understand that you think that it is too

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,039
soft engineering

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
what has already been uh carried out in

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,440
other disciplines

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
and what it was known as model

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,720
engineering in modern engine you have a

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
model which is basically a

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,240
miniature working representation of a

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,679
machine and

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,360
in software engineering you have model

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,159
driven engineering where you have

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,880
a processable a working representation

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,000
in this case

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,080
a diagram which has a model behind

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,039
but it's not just a diagram that you can

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,399
depict but

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,039
it's an artifact that you can process

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,039
that you can

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,520
expand that you can

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,679
analyze where you can perform things

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,679
activities as if it was any other

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,039
software artifact

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,640
and what's the role of uh model driven

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,039
engineering in privacy data protection

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
well

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,640
it's multiple roles there are different

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,480
facets

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,240
dealing with different disciplines and

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,600
with different types of models

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,320
that we addressed in pvp 40. uh

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,960
for instance i would just like to to

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,120
pose some

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,919
some questions that can be answered by

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,360
these models without going to detail

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,159
from the perspective of

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,080
analysis and design maybe they are the

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,640
most well known models that you may be

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,039
familiar with we deal with structural

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,960
data models

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,240
focusing on data you can think of

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
database models

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
which help answering questions such as

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
whether

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,600
you are dealing with personal data which

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
of your fields of your records

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
hold personal data whether it's

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
sensitive personal data

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,679
what's the basis for processing do you

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,880
have consent from the data subject this

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,279
is for

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,399
legitimate purposes this is because a

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
legal regulation

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,320
tells you to sort of data then another

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,600
perspective is that of

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,760
procedural models which

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,440
are usually known for instance as data

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,960
flow diagrams it's one kind of

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,720
user diagram which asks or let's answer

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,240
other questions such as

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,399
which processes you have where you're

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
processing personal data

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,279
and which are the processing activities

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,960
that are being carried out which are the

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,000
data flows that are involved

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,440
what for uh those processors

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
are processing personal data what's the

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,200
purpose which is a key concept in

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
private data protection

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,799
and who will be able to run those

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
processes and to access

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,490
uh those data is not just data at rest

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
that you must

00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,640
[Music]

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,799
be concerned with but also uh data

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,760
in movement and taking into account the

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,440
access control

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,679
and also from the architectural

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,200
perspective uh we can answer questions

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
answer who is storing

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
the data is it uh fully under your

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,399
control or is it

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,840
delegated to a data processor under

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,480
which jurisdiction

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,440
uh have you sent the data abroad to

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,640
other countries

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,919
okay so this is uh regarding design but

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,120
there are other perspectives

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,039
uh for instance requirements engineering

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,360
key in privacy and data protection the

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,440
requirements that can appear as privacy

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,760
goals and properties requirements that

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,960
may come from different regulations for

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,080
instance gdpr

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,519
not only or for industrial standards and

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,600
all those requirements

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,519
would be void if they do not take into

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,519
account the functional requirements

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,679
that provide the context for these

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,760
private data protection requirements

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,200
there's another source of specifications

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
in previous production and that's of

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,159
risk

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,519
this is not a goal-oriented approach but

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
a risk current approach

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,480
where you have the typical elements in a

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,640
risk analyzer you have assets to protect

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,320
can be personal information human rights

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,799
update the subject the reputation of the

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,799
business

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,640
not your usual assets in security

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,320
engineering for you

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,720
what do you want to protect from the

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,240
threat and how you want to address those

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
threats how do you want to solve that

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,559
how do you want to protect your assets

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,320
and how do you know that others are

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,000
also protecting them as well if you are

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,360
using other services

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
then another relevant discipline instead

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,519
of process assurance

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,320
which for instance answers what

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
activities

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
are mandated uh we mentioned

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
requirements

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,519
that may arise from gdpr but it's not

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,360
only product requirements but also

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,799
process requirements activities that you

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,159
must carry out

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,919
for instance carry out an impact

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,519
assessment

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,960
if you have activities you have roles

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,640
that carry them out and you have active

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
artifacts that produce them and that

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,720
provide evidence that you have carried

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,399
out

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
those activities then there are also

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,279
models for what are called assumance

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,440
cases that

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,440
provide for instance answers to

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,640
questions such as how you can argument

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,279
that you are compliant which is the way

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,279
to

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,320
have a logical process you are complying

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,679
with uh with the law

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,519
and which are the evidences which are

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,720
the specific artifacts that you can

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:15,919
use to secure a way to prove that

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,399
pain compliance and finally the

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,679
model of the development process persons

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,440
processes and products

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,880
that are improved in your development

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,320
process all these

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,480
are facets so i put there these loops

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,000
uh they are not just that so one after

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
the other but they can happen

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,519
in parallel and complement one another

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,440
and they complement to another

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,600
from a functional perspective we have

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,360
created a tool set but

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,039
tools are not integrated because you can

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,640
use them for different activities

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,480
same as you would use a hammer and

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,000
screwdriver or a wrench

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,720
when you are doing do it yourself uh

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,360
activities uh as in this workshop you

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,799
don't

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,159
have one plus on the studio this

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,240
model-based engineering is well

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
established there are communities

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
there are bodies of knowledge and there

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,480
are standards for instance antonio cong

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,000
who will present now is working on

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,440
standalone model based software and

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,520
systems meaning

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,440
which establishes a life cycle of models

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,440
and this lifecycle of models can be also

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,520
applied to our projects

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
and in this lifecycle we have several

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,240
points where we can

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,119
share and reuse models so

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,359
this slide is a second key idea in this

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,240
presentation and is how we can share

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,119
or better there we share and reuse

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,760
models because

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,960
sometimes it may seem that models are

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,639
artifacts that

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,159
should be kept for ourselves and we

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,800
don't think that's the case

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
so models start by defining a modern

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,760
language which

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,000
is usually called metamodel of profiles

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,520
in modeling jargon

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,520
you need to define the concepts that

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,159
you're going to use then

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,280
uh for any of the perspectives that we

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
mentioned you need to model the

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,920
regulatory constraints the gdpr or

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
whichever regulation you're abiding by

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,760
and then you must tailor that to your

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,680
the context of your project for instance

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,000
your sme and only some

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,400
cluster supply then you instantiate the

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,599
model in your project

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,480
requirements the requirements i

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,599
mentioned are meta requirements or

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,960
templates

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,760
when they say that you must have a

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,440
purpose to process personal data in your

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
project personal data means

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,079
specific type of data specific records

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,280
so it's just a template a placeholder

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,280
but you need to instantiate that with

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,119
your specific personal data

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
then you transform your models if

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,400
appropriate using

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
our knowledge comply with the

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
regulations and you validate

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
and there's a loop here because there's

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,760
a clear tip that you don't validate just

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
once this is a continuous improvement a

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,920
continuous monitoring

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
process uh you can see now that there

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,240
are

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,599
some project independent parts and some

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,760
project specific parts

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,280
uh this is the first type of reuse but

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,040
it's not the only one you can also have

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
industry policies that provide context

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,000
to your project

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,520
and which are reusable because they come

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,320
from industry practices you can

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,359
have patterns that describe reusable

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,839
solutions

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,240
that can be reused in any project you

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,599
can also have knowledge bases which

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,040
can be uh proprietary or open there can

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,040
be different ways to

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,640
exploit them and you also have the

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,040
considerations of the

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,320
supply chain that can also provide their

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
their own results when you're

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,200
integrating them into place so as you

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,000
can see there are many points

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,320
where models can be can be shared and

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,720
now i'll give the floor to antonio

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,640
hello everyone so what we just saw is

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,280
that we have models everywhere and we

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,160
decide

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
we define two types of model one is how

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,119
do we protect

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,960
applications so we call them application

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
privacy protection models

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,079
and you can see here you have a list of

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,560
domains

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,320
health social network mobility smart

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,079
home fintech

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,160
so from a consumer point of view but

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
also domains from the organization point

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,599
of view

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,079
industry point of view connected

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,520
vehicles smart energy immobility assist

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,520
living security

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,359
just go next go next so on top of it you

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,200
do data processing and we just heard

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,040
about the discussion about data

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,359
and you have you will cr you have

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,800
cross-domain analysis and things like

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,040
that so all those things

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,240
must have their own application privacy

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,280
protection models

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,000
if you go to the next slide

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,880
so and the same for engineering okay so

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,079
the engineer

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,640
must be helped with lots of models and

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,839
depending on the perspective framework

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
risk management

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,680
privacy operationalization and assurance

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
and this relates to

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,680
the previous slide which actually

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,160
somehow showed

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:43,359
with this cycle next slide

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,760
so what we are proposing is to have

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,800
a community that will be launched by

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,200
eclipse

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,880
where stakeholders get together and they

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,440
provide guidance on how

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,960
to produce and to exchange those models

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,839
go to the next slide

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,480
the next item so and actually we think

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,880
there will be

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,720
several task force those which focus on

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,320
applications so for instance

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,320
kovi 19 privacy protection model

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
and those who will focus on the

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,040
engineering for instance threat model

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,800
okay

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,680
once we do that next those task force

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,320
will produce

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,400
models okay but the model has to be of

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,599
good quality you can have bad models and

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
good models so

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
what we'll do is in the community we'll

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,079
provide some requirements

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,040
on the quality and how to validate those

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,079
models

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,440
once we have them we go to next

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,560
we'll publish them uh in the eclipse uh

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,839
community that's the idea okay so

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,760
go next and

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:48,720
uh so we want to launch this

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,720
community this year and we will have

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,359
initial projects

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,160
concerning applications one is on

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,760
connected

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,119
uh sorry cits which means cooperative

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,200
intellectual transport system are

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,359
connected vehicles and the other one

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,200
is on data exchange focusing on smart

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,480
grid okay and the reason is because we

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,280
are involved in a number of those

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,359
projects

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,119
and concerning engineering we have

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,359
exactly the tools which

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,560
samuel has mentioned previously related

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,200
to risk analysis

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,680
requirements engineering privacy by

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,800
design and assurance

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,240
the community participants under the

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,040
umbrella of eclipse will be

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,440
of course the pdp for e partners but we

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,119
have started uh

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
communicating with other participants

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,920
for their participation

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,280
and kavityan you probably know she is

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,440
she invented the term privacy by design

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,720
would be the the chair of this

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
initiative

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,560
caleb is working on something called

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,280
linden i just got an email

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,640
samuel uh just uh 30 minutes ago that

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,280
they want to join

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,839
the nice privacy framework they are also

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,599
interested

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,320
university of urum is working on

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,720
something called privacypattern.org

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,319
actually where samuel is also involved

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,839
and he they are also working on

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,359
connected vehicles

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,720
we also want to attract the gaia x

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,359
idsa data space stakeholders and of

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,520
course

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,440
there are a number of competence network

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,839
in particular concerning cyber security

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,359
we have

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,520
four big projects which want to

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,520
enroll okay and of course there are

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,400
other types of applications

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,920
i've seen so far the fintech i i will be

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,200
working on the standard on privacy

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,079
guidelines for fintech

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,119
and we will ask we will provide guidance

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:41,280
for them to provide models

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,000
next so that's the end of our

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,560
presentation you have here the links

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,560
and i would say the main contact point

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,240
from now on is going to be philip

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,599
because that's through the eclipse

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,760
foundation that will have this community

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,640
thank you first of all i would like to

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,280

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,440
will happen

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,720
june 1st and we will present two other

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,520
research projects

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
eclipse basics which is an open platform

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,440
on

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,599
for industry 4.0 and fasten

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,280
which is a which is building a

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,720
dependency management solution

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,240
acting at the function level

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,960
so thanks again for coming take care of

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:14,800
