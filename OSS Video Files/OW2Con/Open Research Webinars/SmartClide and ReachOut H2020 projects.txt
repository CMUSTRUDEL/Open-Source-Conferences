uh good afternoon thank you very much

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,080
for being here and welcome to this new

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,799
series

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,639
of webinars jointly organized between

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,280
eclipse and w2

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,360
and we had a discussion we realized that

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,519
both organizations were engaged

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
in a collaborative project and that we

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,000
were sharing the same

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
interests so we decided to join our

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
efforts to communicate on our

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
respective project hence the first

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,800
edition of

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,679
this series of webinars and we will

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
hopefully we will hold this webinars on

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,640
a quarterly basis

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,000
our agenda today is after this brief

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,239
introduction we will um move to the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,680
smart client project with the title the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,960
stairway to cloud i like

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,079
this this title by sebastian schultz

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,879
and there will be a second project

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
presented

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
by alexander fev and this project is

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,120
called reach out

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
and then hopefully we'll have an open

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
discussion for

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
to wrap up everything

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
yeah so yeah my name is phil krieff i'm

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,760
research relations director at the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,040
eclipse foundation

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,720
and we wanted to start with this first

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
webinar by explaining uh why open source

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
foundations such as

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,520
our rw2 eclipse are involved in research

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,560
projects

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,400
so when you look at the research

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
project consortium you see there are

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
three main profiles you have industries

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
who are coming with their requirements

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,920
you have researchers who are coming with

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,560
their innovative solutions

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
and they are able to to demonstrate this

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
solution

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
uh through prototypes and we need also a

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
cert

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
profile which are the vendors software

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
vendors who are here to

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,600
industrialize research solution and to

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
be able to deliver a product to the

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
industry now

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
when you are in this kind of

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,759
configuration what happens that

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
at the end of the project or for the

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
research project the industry can decide

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
to leave the projects because they are

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,640
not more interested in

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,399
any improvement or so on you can have

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
researchers who are looking maybe for

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
some other fundings

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
and want to give up as well and you have

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
software vendors who can be bought by

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,200
another organization and decide to live

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
also with the code so

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
if you want to make your project sustain

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
uh

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
you have to go open source and to have a

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
chance

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,959
to be able to replace the missing

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,120
partner in in this configuration

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
all the idea of that is to have this

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
kind of configuration

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
and a part of your project has to be

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,879
open source and

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,239
an open source foundation such w2 or

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,720
eclipse are here to

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
help you building this kind of solution

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,879
and uh

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
during the process that's the open

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,319
source

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
approach for developing code but there

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
is another message i'd like to share

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
with you today is that uh

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
there is a long way between the the uh

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
research

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,680
and the users and the actual users so

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
research doesn't work for uh

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,440
for itself and developers they develop

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
code proof concepts use cases or

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
demonstrators

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,640
that's the guy on the right of your

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
other on this picture here

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,319
but the user is on the other side of a

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
what you can call a value chain

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,239
something that creates value because the

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
users they make business decisions

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
uh well if they're not researchers

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,879
themselves so they

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,159
they work and they decide according to

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,080
a business usage and that business uses

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,400
is requires that the software they use

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
has some training some documentation

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
packaging

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,319
road maps bug fixing support legal even

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,040
some pricing schemes etc

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
so they make a business decision so it's

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
not

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,799
only the code that isn't required it's a

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
like a product if you like and that's

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
between the distance between the

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,319
the developer and the the user is what

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,400
we call the

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,239
the delivery challenge and to address

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
this delivery challenge specifically in

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,319
the card

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
of in the context of open source

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,599
software the value

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,959
is created by the ecosystem so

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,080
uh what we are doing here is contribute

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
to this ecosystem

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
the ecosystem is made of the developer

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
itself

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
system integrators software or

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,799
distribution vendors

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
the users themselves that part of the

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,600
ecosystem but also the open source

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
foundations

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
so what we are doing here eclipse nw2 is

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
provide

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,759
a platform that enables

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,720
developers to develop software

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,440
with some of the product attributes that

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
users

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
would feel comfortable with

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
okay so we talk about this platform it's

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
exactly this is the drone here

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
you see that you have your open source

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
platform where you can actually work

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
with your partners and with your

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
competitors it's open source so it's

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,320
freely accessible for everybody and but

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
to have this kind of

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,479
business environment you need to have

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
four pillars

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
the first one is infrastructure which is

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,960
an open collaborative

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,639
open collaborative infrastructure and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
like that nobody can decide at some

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
point to

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
to stop the servers for you you need

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,199
also

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
you can take advantage of an existing

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
ecosystem

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,120
and you to build your own community on

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,280
on on top of it

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
you also need to have some governance on

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
the on your community to be sure that

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
everybody will will

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
behave fairly with the rest of the

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,160
community

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,000
and last not least you need to have also

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,440
ip management intellectual property

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
management and licensing

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,120
of the code and once you have this

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,400
infrastructure in place

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,800
then it's easy for you to compete on

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,680
your own added values on your own

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
product

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
against your competitor and and share

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,840
share things on

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
bottom of that

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
these slides present you um support for

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,520
you of open of research projects

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,520
where we are involved as a foundation

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,639
some are already done some of them are

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
still running

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
and i don't well not go through all of

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,199
them but the idea is just to show you

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
the

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
type of domains where we're involved

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,280
we're involved in iot

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,560
in embedded systems in automotive

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,240
tools industry 4.0

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
and if you want to have more details

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,240
please go to eclipse.org

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,120
research sorry it's okay

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
yeah you you have your own pages there

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
and

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,560
uh w2 we also have a number of

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,919
collaborative projects and the areas

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,039
are more cloudware smart cities software

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,000
engineering and

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
support actions and typically the uh

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
reach out to productions is the one that

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
will be

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,880
introduced in this webinar so

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,720
that's introduction but i will not

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,639
hand over to the first speaker without

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,440
reminding you that we have another

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,000
webinar

00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,280
already scheduled on march the 4th 2021

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,639
so save the date and now

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,560
we are introducing the first speaker

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,800
okay yeah i will briefly introduce our

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120
first speaker which is sebastian schultz

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,240
uh sebastian is a senior researcher at

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,160
atp research center in bremen in germany

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
when he's not playing cellular sebastian

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,720
is involved in diverse diverse

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,599
euro project in several fields such as

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,919
automotive manufacturing and logistics

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,120
uh actually sebastian is the coordinator

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
of the smart light project

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,199
a project that wants to build the stairs

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,199
to make us to the cloud

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
so just the best sensor floor is yours

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,120
hello everyone

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
okay very good yeah my name is sebastian

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,120
schulze from atb

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
philippe or philip sorry

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
already introduced us we are private

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
research institute

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
located in bremen northern part of

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,360
germany

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,400
and i will present you the smart light

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,599
project very short agenda

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,599
um we'll speak a little bit about idea

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
and the concept so this includes our

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,840
motivation the approach

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,319
which are the targeted users and what is

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,360
the value of smart light

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
then a very quick overview on the smart

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
light pilots

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,360
and then i think what should be the core

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,479
our plan features for the smart light

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,720
project what is smart glide

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,840
an overview of the feature map and

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
something about the

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,080
life cycle support and then last but not

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,519
least

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,120
the road map maybe

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,680
in the beginning some facts about um

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
smart client so the project titled smart

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
cloud integrated

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
development environment supporting the

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,440
full stack implementation composition

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,320
and deployment of data data centered

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,120
services and applications in the cloud

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
very long i think we should now stick to

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,880
smart client

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:09,120
um the duration it started this year

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,279
and it's a european research project

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,120
runs for three years that means by end

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,440
of 2020

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
we will finalize this project

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
contribution

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
from european commission is around 5

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
million euros

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:30,800
and it's running under this

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
horizon 2020 ict 2019

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,440
call which is for cloud computing

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,080
and you can also find further

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,160
information on our website

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
on the right side in the picture you can

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,720
see our

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,560
partners in the project and i think

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,800
we have a quite nice mixture

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,600
of universities research organizations

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
technology providers and for pilot

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
partners

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,040
we are located in portugal spain uk

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
greece

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,240
luxembourg and germany these are

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,680
the map of our partners and then

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,440
let's go into the details so motivation

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,240
for smart light

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,760
i think we could somehow claim that

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
cloud computing

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,519
somehow can be considered as one of the

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,800
main enablers

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,600
for digital transformation because it

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
somehow allows organizations so that you

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
can

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,800
disengage growing

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,399
of organizations from the need of these

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,399
underlying infrastructures

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,959
and yeah digital transformation changing

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,000
every sphere of society and this

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
especially this year at a very fast pace

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,120
it has technological and cultural

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
breakthroughs

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,680
um and what we claim cloud computing and

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
agile methodologies these are some

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
the key enablers of digital

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,519
transformation

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800
and with smart light we aim to boost the

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,600
adoption of such

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
cloud solutions and you can see this on

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,640
on the bottom

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,760
um our idea is to support

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,480
developers in producing

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
cloud services and by this then also

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,880
support

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
digital transformation

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,279
yeah our approach what i already said we

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
want to boost the adoption of cloud

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,600
solutions

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,480
um but you all know

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,480
we have some limitations classical

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,839
limitations in

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,480
developing software solutions um

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,959
what we believe um these three are the

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,360
the crucial ones so the first one

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,440
um creating solutions from scratch is

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,480
time consuming complex and expensive

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,600
and i think all of us know this

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,399
what we are aiming in smart light is um

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,519
that we will be able by applying smart

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,279
lights to have a

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
faster and more efficient development of

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
cloud services to get some deeper

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
insights on

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,480
how cloud and code works

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,720
the second limitation from our point of

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
view is

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,480
if you want to reuse software so

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,240
composition of

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,399
existing services is um

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
theoretically it's possible but in

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,399
practice it's somehow limited due to

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
non-uniform classification and

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,440
documentation

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,279
and on top um you always have a

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
compromise between quality of service

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,360
and security

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
our aims here is we want to provide more

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
secure and easy ways

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
to reuse quality code so code that is

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
really

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,160
of good quality and gaining trust and

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,920
facilitating the reuse of services

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,240
and then the third limitation

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,160
predict and control costs is very

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
difficult using price models of public

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,240
cloud providers

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,959
and if you are aware on

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,959
how this is working i think you would

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,040
agree to this

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
and our aim is to be a code learning

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,800
tool deeper understanding

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,600
on the costs of the cloud so

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,360
what are our targeted users of course

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,320
the primary user

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,959
for in development environment is the

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,959
developer

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,639
but if you look at the team of

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,760
developers

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,079
we can easily involve

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
some more actors and i think that's

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
quite crucial

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,279
that we can also support

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
users doing other things in a software

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
development project

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,680
for example product designers by

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,720
integrating tools in an

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,199
ide you can support them so

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,120
to be part of the team or closer to the

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,160
the developer team

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,560
than scrum masters and product owners

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,639
you can provide them with metrics so

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,160
that they are always aware on the

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,360
current state of a project

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,959
but also a spot sponsor so or

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,680
someone who is you can provide them

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,519
also some different types of metrics so

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
that they are always aware on the status

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,320
of a project

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
but we believe that smart light has not

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
only

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,519
um value for the development team but

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,360
also for the project and also to the

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,519
end users and um

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
because when you involve the end user in

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,639
early testing you have a very

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,959
agile approach and this always has a

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
very nice feedback to the development

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,639
team

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,399
so these are our targeted users whereby

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,399
the focus is on the developer

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
before we go a little bit more into

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
detail of the

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,839
smart client ide i want to

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
talk very briefly about all four pilots

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,839
um

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
very different pilots but all of these

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,480
companies are

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,199
comp uh are developing software so pilot

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
one is

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,880
platforms for social security

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,880
organizations

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
um that's a large company from

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,680
luxembourg um

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,959
pilot two it's a company a medium-sized

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,440
company from portugal they are providing

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,199
an iot catalog

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,360
the third pilot is also an sme from

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,959
spain um and they are providing

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,839
real-time communication platforms

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,560
especially for voice and video

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,680
communications

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,360
and the pilot 4 is a german i would say

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,440
mid cap

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,440
they provide pdm plm solutions

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
so you see that's very different pilots

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
but

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
um all of them have something in common

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,959
it's

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,800
they all provide platforms and they are

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,920
developing services around their

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,560
platforms

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
that means they need high customization

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,680
reuse of code

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,240
and we believe that's a very good fit

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,199
for testing and evaluating our smart

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
light

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,000
technologies

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,920
so what is smart glide um

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,240
yeah it's a cloud ide cloud-based um

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,920
development environment

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,560
we claim um that by

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,000
being a cloud-based ide we can support

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,839
the collaboration

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,279
of different stakeholders inside the

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,279
team and

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,600
it will be based on the coding by

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
demonstration paradigm

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,279
and then from under underlying

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,000
technologies we

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,320
see our key component is the service

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
composition the service discovery

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
and in the background the deep learning

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
engine

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,160
by service composition is if you want to

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
create a service a software service

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:14,640
smart client will support you in this by

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,120
checking already available services

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,199
providing your hints and tips so con

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,400
create control data and operation

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,240
abstractions and

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,400
it will be able to combine abstractions

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
to create new services

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
for the service discovery

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,440
the idea is to integrate in

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,400
or to import in a repository

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,720
already existing services and resources

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,280
and if you search for something

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
um for example a logging service if you

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,080
want to to

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,080
create this that the service discovery

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,360
provides you with suggestions

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,880
which service you might reuse

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,559
and in order to be able to

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,160
support the developer in in

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
discovery of services and the

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,760
composition of services

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,320
we need in the background something like

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,000
a deep learning engine

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,760
where we want to create automatic

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
software classification context

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
identification and the selection of

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,799
abstractions

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,440
and then also some programmatic output

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,440
generation

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,320
now i would like to show you something

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,960
about discovery of services and after

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,880
this composition of new services

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
yeah what is the problem uh with

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,679
discovery services

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,840
you know you have um something some

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,120
registries like udd

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,559
ice you can automatically expose

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,600
available resources and cloud services

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,720
and one could say this does

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,320
already exist yes that's too

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,120
true to some extent but we want to

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,559
provide something more so additional

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,919
information so that we can

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:10,080
uh better classify if we can reuse a

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,880
service or decision support and by

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,240
for this we want to include descriptions

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
about

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,880
existing services certifications other

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,320
services and applications using

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,600
the proposed service also we want to

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,240
include the opinions from other users

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,080
and also a comparison with other similar

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,679
services

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,840
and we want to use for this ontology

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,960
based techniques so that we are able to

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,320
identify these cloud service categories

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,039
now if you know how to

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,880
discover services we can also think on

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,880
composition of new services

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
and here we want to create new services

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
either from scratch

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,600
or by composing uh several

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,480
existing services into a new one

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,960
and hereby we want to support um the

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
full lifecycle

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,039
if you need coding we want to support

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,720
these coding by demonstration

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,880
um all the code what we create

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
or what is created using smart that

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
should be

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
reusable and directly testable we want

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,480
to support

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,320
a high level of abstractions of course

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
of version control and configuration

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,480
management

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
and i think what's very interesting is

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,280
this insightful source code monitoring

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,320
so that we can analyze the source code

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
so

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,240
that in future you can get better

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,440
prediction

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,720
and proposes for reuse

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,760
and we also want to have

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,240
some cost simulation of services to be

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,280
created

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,360
yeah here you can see on one picture

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,520
our features map that's more or less

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,720
what i already explained

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,440
on top you can see everything what is

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,120
somehow related to the user interface

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,320
and then in the middle the backend

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,600
services and on the bottom

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,679
existing technologies which we

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,280
aim to integrate of course we are not

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,400
thinking on integrating

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,039
every of these tools but some of these

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,720
tools

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:30,080
over an open api um

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,200
our idea is that we base a smart clients

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,640
on the eclipse

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,080
geo platform and

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,440
in principle all of these things

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,440
i already explained

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
then about um the lifecycle support in

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,760
the idea

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,360
i already said that we want to support

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,799
the full life cycle from

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,480
planning to monitoring um

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:03,039
for this we want to integrate

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,039
existing tools on the on the market

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,039
and we believe by integrating

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,440
existing solutions something like for

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,600
example git or gyro or

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,600
gitlab we can

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,840
achieve an extreme optimization

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,840
which i think is necessary

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,520
to get better

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,840
[Music]

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,840
outputs during the software development

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,440
our roadmap i said that we are

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,880
we started with our project this year um

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,600
so we just um finalized our milestone

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
one

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,000
uh so concept and architecture is done

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,480
uh we had our

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,960
first review meeting already and we

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,520
got very nice feedback um seems that

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,360
reviewers are happy with our

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,880
achievements right now

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,720
then mid of next year we expect the

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,320
first prototypes

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,159
so that means now we are in the space

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,360
between one and two then um

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,760
with these first prototypes

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,799
we will ask our pilot partners so that

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,799
they can do

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:27,120
first testing then mid 2020

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,840
we expect the final prototypes and by

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,600
end of

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,280
2020 we will be ready for the

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,799
final demonstration of the smart light

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
technologies and

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
i think what's uh

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
very interesting and the smart light

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,120
technologies are planned to be published

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,360
as open source under epl

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,559
and we discussed this in the consortium

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,720
and this is um

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,200
right now our plan and as coordinator

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,760
we already started submitting some of

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,960
our background technologies

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,240
as under epl to the

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,080
eclipse repositories

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,080
and that's it from smartlight

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,720
thanks for having any questions or

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,919
suggestions

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,880
i'm happy to try to answer no

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
i would have a question um so since

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,480
you're doing this uh

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
big cloud project and you know in

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,360
germany and

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,279
also europe now i think everybody's

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,480
talking about gaia x

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,360
and it seems to be like the

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,640
current hype initiative um i would be

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,720
interested to know

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,919
but do you have a relation to them are

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,720
you involved or

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
do you see where you would fit in into

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,320
this initiative

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,039
uh no we have no direct relation with

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
them

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,720
and we're also not involved um but my my

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
colleague phillip

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,240
um so not the philip in this call

00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:00,400
um from atb my colleague um he

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,799
just these days uh contacted a provider

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
which

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,799
which is offering um gaia compliant

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
cloud solutions so because we want to

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,400
get in touch with them to to

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,000
start learning what we have to

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,200
do to be gaia x compliant but this just

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,880
started recently yeah

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
and maybe one other question you had

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,559
this use case

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,320
about what it was called iot catalog

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
can you explain a bit what this what

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,440
this is about this is

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,039
this iot catalog is um

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,400
um it's created from a portuguese

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,320
company and

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,039
um you can enter

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,360
your iot solutions either hardware or

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,360
software enter these in the catalog

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,679
and for example search for

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,880
solutions which you uh

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,200
yeah if you need a sensor for i don't

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
know

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
um ugly food for example you could go to

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,159
this

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,200
iot catalog and search for um

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,760
such solutions and it will provide you

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,520
a list of potential hardware and

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,520
services to support

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
or to fulfill your search request

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,080
so it's a little bit like a marketplace

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
without the marketplace functionality

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,320
it's really

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
really a catalogue for heart and

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,480
software good well thank you very much

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,880
sebastian

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,679
uh now it's time for a second

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
presentation

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,480
in this webinar by alexander f so

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,799
alexander you could

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,880
get ready to pre to to share your screen

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,919
thank you for uh welcoming me to

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,279
president reach out

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,799
uh in this webinar so i'll uh

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
i'll make a first introduction about the

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,080
project so what uh

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,279
what is uh reach out so reach out is uh

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,720
it's a also a part of age 2020 but uh

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,279
in the 2018 dash i can't remember

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,840
program and it's a small coordination

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,480
and support action

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
so we the duration of the project is

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,159
three years

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,919
uh 2019 20 and 21 so we're about

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,200
two-thirds of the project

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,080
and our objective is to help european

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
projects

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,000
develop their market value and reach out

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
to their end users that's the name of

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,279
the project

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,360
and how do we do that we help them

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,000
develop their own beta testing campaigns

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,120
so this is what it's all about

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,039
and it's not only open to european

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
research projects but also to any

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
european sme

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,480
and to any open source projects there

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,760
are three partners in that

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,240
in the reach out project so

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,559
the first one being frowned for focus

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,080
who's the coordinator of the project

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,720
and uh od2 who's also a partner

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,960
and ourselves the ucsoft and myself i'm

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,960
from

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,320
um so where does the beta testing

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,919
campaign typically fit in a

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,600
in in a project um so better testing

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,600
campaign is some kind of acceptance

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,360
testing so typically you would have

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,039
a first alpha version that's been

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,320
developed and then when you have a

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,200
better version

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,880
uh this is when you you should be able

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440
to

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
to run a beta testing campaign so it's

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,360
it's when you open

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,159
your results uh which start becoming

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,919
industrial or market ready

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,600
to external users uh it's time-bound and

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,960
and this is where you want to get

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,520
feedback from

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
from from end users so why do you want

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,159
to do this

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,880
there's a number of benefits that the

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,880
beta distinct campaign can give to you

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,320
the first one is actually not the first

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
one you would think about

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,919
but especially for larger projects

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,120
such as collaboration research projects

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,039
uh having

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
running a beta testing campaign helps

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,159
all the partners in the project

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,600
align their expectations it's like a

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,600
focus point

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,360
uh where they can say okay now we have

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,159
some results is that the right ones we

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,799
want to share

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,919
are we ready so it helps them focus at

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,399
one point together

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,840
and get get back together on something

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,320
that they can focus on which is the

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,360
better version that's going to be tested

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,679
uh then the three other uh benefits

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
typically it will generate or it will

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,679
increase the quality of

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,360
your results because well you get

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,200
external people testing your

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
your software or your results which is

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,120
always good and they can

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,559
uh find out some some issues and then

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,200
you can fix them

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,559
uh the second one is uh it's not it's

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,880
not as much about the

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,399
the software results or the results

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,760
themselves but all the other

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,200
product attributes which you have to uh

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,880
you have to have ready when you run a

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
beta testing campaign so we're thinking

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,720
about packaging

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,279
your software should be well packaged it

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,679
should be

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,520
installable we're thinking about

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,120
documentation and tutorials if you want

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
users to be able to use it you should

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,880
have some documentation to tell them

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,799
what to do with it how it works

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,799
and also during the duration of the

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
campaign when you have your beta testers

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,799
testing the software

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,799
you should be ready you should have some

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,720
infrastructure or some team organized to

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,279
provide them some support

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,960
and also um in order to advertise your

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,880
campaign you need to do some promotion

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,640
so it's you're getting closer to

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,320
marketing area there so

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
that's all the other product attributes

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,679
which is not just the actual result

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,840
itself but

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,720
all the all the other stuff that makes

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,679
uh the the product usable by beta

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,120
testers and of course uh by getting

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,679
feedback from

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,320
external users you might identify some

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
further

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,320
exploitation opportunities which you

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,440
might or might not

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,039
have thought about before

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
so um so what we like to say is that

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,080
well if a project

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,600
is able to develop and implement their

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,120
own beta testing campaign

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
uh it means that they've reached some

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,240
important milestone

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,080
it proves that the projects has

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,799
something it has what it takes to engage

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,640
with the

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,799
external actors to bring value to the

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,880
market to develop their own

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,399
ecosystem so this this is also one one

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,120
of the reasons why

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,080
uh europe is is funding reach out

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,240
because they

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,679
they have seen in the past that uh many

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,039
research projects have produced some

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,120
results which

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,480
were not adequate for the market or

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,279
which were too far from

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
from from the users so by running better

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,799
testing campaigns

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,919
it's one step forward to to being market

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,360
ready and to

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,120
get closer to the users so what

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,200
do we do in reach out to support all

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,640
this so we've uh first of all we've

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,559
developed a methodology

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,919
uh which is like which is a five-stage

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,159
methodology to help

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,360
the people implement their own beta

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,039
testing campaign

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,960
so all the details on the website

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,159
there's a there's a document and there's

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,200
a set of slides which is

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,159
superset this one

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
and so basically there's five stages

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,559
there's the strategy stage which helps

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,679
you define

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,960
uh well the objectives of the campaigns

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,760
the role of the different people

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
involved

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
uh the supports all the the interests of

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,519
the incentives for the for the better

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,200
testers

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
then there's the technology side where

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,360
you need to package your software

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,320
uh prepare some scenario you cannot just

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,399
tell users

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,159
use it you have to guide them by putting

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,440
some scenario that you want them to

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,840
execute

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,960
and also define the precise questions

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,000
that you want to ask them

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
to get the optimal feedback

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
then there might be some writing to be

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,679
done so you want to write what we call a

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,039
campaign page describing the beta

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,200
testing campaign

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,320
possibly a leaflet documentation and

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,480
tutorials

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,640
then there's the campaign itself so you

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640
promote a campaign

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
and then you recruit the better testers

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,960
they provide their feedback and in the

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,080
end there's a closing phase with the

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,600
with some reporting to be done and uh

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
we have this notion of campaign

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
dashboard which i'll describe

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,960
in a few seconds so for all the uh for

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
all these steps

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,880
uh we have built we have put together an

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,080
infrastructure

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
um so here is a brief uh

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,519
overview of the architecture so

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,880
basically it's it's based on

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,919
uh on existing pre-existing components

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,799
which we had

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,080
uh provided by ow 2 which had which were

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,600
x wiki

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,919
fusion directory and and simpa and also

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
the

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,000
ldap of the w2 to which we have added

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,320
an instance of lime survey and we've

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,039
also connected it with the usoft

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
uh uforge factory uh which can be used

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
to package

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,360
your software if you don't if you don't

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,640
have it packaged prior

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,240
prior to this um so we've developed some

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,360
x-wiki classes

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,080
and uh in order to integrate the various

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,240
components

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,679
uh we had to develop what we call

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,799
wrappers so it's

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,519
basically pieces of codes or

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,120
which which you put in x wiki following

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,200
the x wiki component

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,919
uh way of developing those wrappers

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
and so there's one for connecting with

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,720
fusion directory one for

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
connecting with simba using their soap

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,200
interface

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,560
and one connecting with lime survey and

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,560
um since we're about open source as well

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
today uh so all these wrappers that we

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
have developed who decided

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,919
that we put them in open source because

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,960
they could be valuable for someone who

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,040
wants to use them

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
who knows so they're available as open

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,399
source on the

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,960
owl youtube git lab you'll find the link

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,800
on the retail platform

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,720
so what have we done beside that well

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,159
we've developed uh for all the

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,200
all the key elements we've developed a

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,200
set of templates for each of the blocks

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,040
that are required to build a campaign

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,079
and i'll i'll go through them

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,960
now um so the first one is

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,639
a home page so rich we've made reach out

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,119
self service so when you go to the

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,399
website you can self register

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,640
and when you register you get uh

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
you get a you get an account and you can

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,079
uh

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,760
you can automatically have access to

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,160
all the resources create your own

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,240
campaign so the first step is you

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,000
describe what your project is all about

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,359
um and then you have access to all the

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,880
resources

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,520
so the uh the campaign page itself

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,000
uh can be filled in with a form so

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,079
provide

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,599
a form which guides you to create the

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,680
campaign where you

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,960
you put as information your logo and

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,359
website uh

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,400
you describe the campaign itself what

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,560
are the dates

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,760
uh what are possible requirements so do

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,160
you need to

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,599
uh do you need to have some special

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,880
software desktop

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,320
or data knowledge

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
so that's all the requirement part then

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
you describe the scenario

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,640
you can also put links to where you can

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,359
download the software or access it if

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,839
it's a sas service

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,839
links to documentation and one point

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,240
which i'll welcome later

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,839
back later too is incentives so what

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,880
will bit of testers get for their

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,520
uh for their work and on the side

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,839
uh when you create the campaign page we

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,079
generate a mailing list which can act as

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,320
a

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,200
as a forum to interact between the beta

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
testers

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,119
and the campaign managers should they

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,240
have any any questions or should they

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,440
need help during

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,440
during the testing phase um

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,800
so we automatically also with a with

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,720
this campaign we provide

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,400
a monitoring dashboard it's like if you

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,839
want it's a 24

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,680
checkpoint self-evaluation list um

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,079
so it's very visual we've tried to make

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,480
it simple to use

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,359
so it it this eight points about the

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,920
management

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,440
so to make sure that you've made all the

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,359
all the organization

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,079
decisions uh you've got the right

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,760
person's appointed

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,320
and the scope of the companies clearly

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,680
defined etc then we have eight questions

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
about the preparation

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,240
uh whether all these technical elements

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,040
are ready the documentation the product

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,079
the fine prints etc and then we have one

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,000
for the execution

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,520
right questions regarding the

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,920
questionnaires uh

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,720
whether it's live whether uh you've

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,240
promoted them

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,800
and whether you've got their answers

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,320
back so this dashboard can also be used

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,040
in the case of a research project

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,079
to report to the reviewers and also to

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,240
communicate with your partners

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
then there's the questionnaire itself uh

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,280
so as i said we've integrated lime

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,920
survey however

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,800
we felt that rather than uh giving you

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,280
access to

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,640
an empty survey in lime survey we did

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,040
some research about

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,440
what's what a good questionnaire is

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,560
and so what we found is we found we

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,880
found some literature

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
about it and this should be a mix of

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,200
open and close questions so we came up

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
with

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,960
this sample questionnaire that we

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,880
generate of 34 questions

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,079
and different sections a mix of open and

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,079
close questions

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,839
you can reword each of them you can

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,320
erase all of them if you don't like them

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,720
you can

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,119
add your own so that's something that we

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,359
can also help you with

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,880
to support you doing this so we've had

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,640
we've had campaigns who

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,240
had their questionnaires beforehand so

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,880
what that it is they just entered their

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,599
own

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,599
we've had other campaigns which just

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,200
just relied on the ones we provided

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,400
because it seemed good for them

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,720
and we've had other ones who mixed

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,640
their own questions with the ones we

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,280
propose that's quite good

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,760
and so the features of lime survey is

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,320
that

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,280
every time there's a questionnaire

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,640
return the

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,160
campaign manager gets an email at any

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
time they can view statistics about the

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,400
responses you can export them in any

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,640
format

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,720
so it's it's a handy tool that

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,320
that that we've been using it's a nice

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,599
open source alternative to

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,599
google forms not to name them

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,400
so we offer a number of other templates

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,000
and tools which can all be accessed on

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,839
on on the beta center

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,119
so we provide documentation templates

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,720
with a checklist

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
we provide a fairly extensive

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,680
communication package to help you

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,359
promote the campaign so this uh this

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,960
contains a number of pre

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,599
predefined emails uh contents for tweets

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,000
as well

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,119
that you can use to promote your your

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,160
campaign

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,000
uh we provide uh some

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,359
some guidelines to recruit and motivate

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
beta testers

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,640
we provide all the necessary fine prints

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,800
so privacy gdpr related stuff

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,079
and at the end of the campaign we're

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,359
also here to help you

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,720
and uh if you need us to uh to put

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,920
together the report

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,400
uh either for your project or for

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,000
the reviewers if you want um so one one

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
point which is important is how you

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,359
recruit beta testers and what are the

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,920
incentives you can give them

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,760
so uh in general what we tell projects

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
is that the projects themselves

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,760
uh probably know that potential beta

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
test is better than we do

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,280
so that could be colleagues partners

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,839
universities

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,839
quite often they they don't think that

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,760
students of university partners are good

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,359
candidates but they usually are even

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,079
their colleagues would not don't work on

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,720
the project but might be interested

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,079
however by by joining reach out if you

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,400
if you put your campaign in reach out

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,720
you

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,960
become part of our ecosystem so you can

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
benefit from previous projects who have

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,319
uh

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
put their campaigns and we will expect

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,839
from you that for future

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,240
campaigns you can provide better testers

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,200
as well from your project to

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,480
other future better testing campaign and

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,880
also

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,119
in terms of recruiting better testers we

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,760
run a newsletter

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,560
and we put some promotion material uh

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
for example

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,359
also in our uh twitter account and our

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,680
linkedin account

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,760
um another way to attract better testers

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,359
is to give them some incentives

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,240
um so one of the uh incentives could be

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,160
simply

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,000
project goodies so project goodies if

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,040
you have any uh t-shirts or mugs those

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,800
things like this

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,400
but more generally better testers are

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,480
more than happy if you just mention the

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,720
names just for recognition

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,140
so you can do that on your website uh in

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
reach out we have a page on

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,319
[Music]

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,599
on the beta center where we uh we can

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,480
list those beta testers

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,839
which have whom who have agreed to to

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,079
have their name appear

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,040
and usually we have a good uh feedback

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,640
when we tell them

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
look we have this hall of fame would you

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,440
like your name and affiliation to appear

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,960
and the more most of the time they're

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,640
very happy and they thank us for doing

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,079
it so it's quite good

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,800
and so two important things is that

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,040
we have uh so europe being generous with

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,960
us we have some money to run a reach out

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,599
lottery at the end of the project so all

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,000
the

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,640
better testers who provided some uh

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,880
feedback

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,800
will be part of the lottery if they

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,680
provided their email address

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,520
and also we have the possibility because

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,760
we didn't travel to

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,560
give better testers some financial

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,560
incentives

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,880
so we can work that out with you in

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,880
terms of and we can adjust the amount

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,359
but we can give some money to better

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,359
testers

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
so just to wrap up so the timeline of

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,280
the

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,079
of the campaign could be something

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
between

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,400
one to five months depending how ready

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,359
you are or not when you start contacting

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,079
us

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,440
between the preparation phase uh then

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,800
the uh

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,040
recruitment phase and the actual

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,280
campaign itself and the wrap up

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,800
so that's something that we uh we work

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,880
on it together

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,839
and how do you get started if you want

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,000
to use reach out

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,040
well basically as i said it's all

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
self-service so you

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,079
you go to the platform you register your

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,800
project

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,400
and what happens is that we see that

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
you've registered so

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
um we will we can arrange an online

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,720
presentation with you

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,200
uh we can also uh organize a webinar

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,720
with yourself or with the pro with the

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,160
plenary meeting in your project we've

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
done that in the past as well to see

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,160
whether

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,960
there's an interest here and and then

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,560
when you register we of course you have

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,280
access to all the self-service material

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,359
i said but

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,480
we can help you at any time so we've

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,000
been doing that for

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,920
a number of projects where we help them

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
which we first check that everything's

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,599
complete we held them

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
technically if there's any need with

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,760
lime survey etc

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
and of course we help them promote uh

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,119
promote the campaign

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,760
together so um

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,599
so basically just i don't it's all and

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
also one thing that we like to insist on

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,640
is that it's all free so

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,440
we paid by europe to do so and uh

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,000
it's also available for smes for free

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,520
and it's also

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,280
available for open source project for

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,319
free that includes

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,920
access to the platform and our uh

00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:53,119
hopefully helpful support so

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,200
so the just just to show you the

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,720
better center so that's actually uh the

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,720
website here

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,640
we try to make things as simple as

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,280
possible so if your project literally go

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,119
here

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,040
and you can register by simply clicking

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,640
on this button which takes you to the

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,040
registration page and then you get an

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,200
access code so it's very simple

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,400
and if you're a beta tester you're taken

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,079
here and then you can

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,920
view here uh the number of uh campaigns

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,960
that we have on reach out which are open

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,520
at the moment and the past ones here

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,640
that we've had so far and i think i'll

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,200
stop here and

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,640
and take some questions if you have any

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,119
i was wondering uh

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,800
when when what is the best time to to

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,040
launch this kind of

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,880
testing campaign better testing campaign

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,960
in a research project

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,119
and can we launch several several

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,160
several campaigns for the same project

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,240
sure yeah so this is a good question so

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,920
typically um you should you should

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,560
launch the beta testing campaign when

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,280
you feel

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,359
confident that your results uh can be

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,280
put in the hands of somebody who

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,280
hasn't developed it so it's what we call

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,680
the the better version so

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,400
it should be somewhat stable somewhat

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,000
usable

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,440
it doesn't have to be perfect it doesn't

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,560
have to be bug-free

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,640
and there's several uh there's several

00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,480
types of campaign one one is to get

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,280
i mean the main the main thing is to get

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,040
some feedback so you shouldn't use it to

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,800
well you could use it to have the users

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,560
find the box for you because you haven't

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,640
done any tests beforehand but that's

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
bad reason the good reason is really to

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,920
get some feedback so

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,680
it could be even simple things you could

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,400
do a campaign to say look

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,880
uh do this scenario and in scenario hey

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,240
we

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,240
propose you this design or this way of

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,599
performing computation and scenario b

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,280
will propose the other one

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,880
which one do you prefer that could be a

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,800
valid campaign just a simple

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,400
aob and of course in a typical

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
research project or project there's

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,440
several modules so each module

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,680
could have their own campaign tested

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,480
separately so we've had that in uh

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,079
i think articonf has had a number of

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,520
different campaigns for different little

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,839
things that they had

00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,280
very short in time to get feedback so

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,760
there's

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,280
yes you're you're very welcome to do as

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,680
many campaigns as you want

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,720
for different uh modules as soon as you

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,440
have something that

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,880
somebody external can play with so you

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,000
might you might have to help them by

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,119
providing if

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,640
it's some data crunching

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,720
software you might help them with

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,680
providing some sample data sets for

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
example

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,480
but as soon as you want or you'd like to

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,079
have some external evaluation you can do

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,880
it

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,880
one question do you have plans to

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,760
continue this work after the

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,000
csa has ended like you know providing

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,599
this as a service or something like this

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,599
we really have the plan to continue the

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,319
service now we're still working on the

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,000
business model because today it is of

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,160
course subsidized by the

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,599
http 2020 project

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,599
so what we intend to do is uh based on

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,119
the experience we've built

00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:01,680
is continue to offer this service

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:04,800
to either research project

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,520
smes and open source projects out of

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,680
europe

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,960
but definitely definitely now right at

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,599
the moment we are really

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,079
building something to be continued yes

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,000
i mean that sounds very useful for

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,200
research projects to have something like

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,760
this right and to know

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,280
that every project has like to start

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,880
from scratch doing a better testing

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,200
campaign yeah that would be

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,960
yeah we felt that many projects were

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
targeting researchers

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,440
whereas the year the commission wants

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,839
the project to target real markets

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,680
so this we are there are many ways

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,319
to link a researcher and the developer

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,400
with

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,520
real users use cases for instance that's

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,559
what that's one of the

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,480
those ways but we realized that beta

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,040
testing was one of the mechanisms that

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,319
would

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:56,559
help researchers and developers to

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:59,359
work together with a a real-life user

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,960
as a target instead of just developing

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,760
technology for the sake of developing

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,280
technology

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,599
but developing something that can be

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,880
used and we also realize because it's

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,240
something that we've done in other

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,720
projects before

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,720
that it was uh very useful in terms of

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,160
feedback as ericsson mentioned so

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,960
we can even identify ways to use the the

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,960
the software that had not been imagined

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,800
by the partners

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,319
yeah just just one question on the the

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,119
requirements around

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,720
the open source projects uh utilizing

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,400
reach out is there any specific

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,960
requirements in terms of

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,720
the licenses used or exactly where

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,720
they're hosted these projects

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,920
well actually richard is very liberal

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,920
because

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,280
the the remit is to provide this service

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,480
to research projects

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,839
open source projects and

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,640
european smes so there's no limits

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,040
or proprietary at this stage there is no

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,119
for

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,480
uh for the eclipse code base or the

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,800
other bluetooth code base

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,280
we as open source foundations we are

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,599
very careful to what sort of licenses

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,400
come with the project that we would be

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,079
accepting

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,440
whereas reach out is very very

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,440
economic and agnostic

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,040
thank you cedric so thanks thanks for

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,480
joining this
