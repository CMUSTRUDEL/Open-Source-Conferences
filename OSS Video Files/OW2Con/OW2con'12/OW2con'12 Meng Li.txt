Description: 
	Tracking code evolution for open source universe - Meng Li, Peking University
AbstractÂ : The existing large amount of OSS artifacts has provided abundant materials for understanding how code is reused in open source universe, in particular, what code pieces are mostly reused, in what circumstances people reuse code, and so forth. Understanding this process could help with legacy software maintenance, as well as help to explore best practice of software development. Targeting the change history data of thousands of open source projects, we try to answer the following question: First, how is code reused by other projects? Second, how are code files organized in project and how does this organization structure change over time? To answer these questions, there are several technical difficulties we have to overcome. For example, because of the different kinds of VCSs, it is hard to figure out a uniform model which can represent the evolution progress of code files stored in them. Also, each VCS may have its own data format, so, extracting data from them is a big challenge. Furthermore, using current software algorithm and hardware platform to analyze the version iteration and reuse information of about a billion code files is another challenge.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,109
so Lehman is going to to tell us about

00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,929
the work that's being carried carried

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,259
out at picking university together with

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,870
Professor doming way and it's about the

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,170
trustee software repository which will

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,390
be very soon coming to tour w too so we

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,070
already have the installation and as

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,660
will be part of the squat program

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,869
extension in 2013 and so now it's up to

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,420
you for 15 minutes ok ok good afternoon

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,059
everyone a monkey from picking universe

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,820
state Beijing China and I think I'm the

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,559
only Chinese guy here joining now yes

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,379
actually this paralysis would be

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,270
presented by me with Joe policy they

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,210
didn't manage to come to France so I

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,440
will replace her and the purloined some

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:59,100
research work under growing in number

00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,230
University and actually the presentation

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,140
can be divided into two parts the first

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,659
one the first part is to how will you

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,450
introduce cable / briefly introduce

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,820
introduction of the trustee software

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,909
repository and that his second part i

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,130
will introduce the testing lab data sent

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,890
data center under this is the agenda and

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,830
first the background software reuse aims

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,290
to improve software development we are

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,600
reusing software resources and the

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,420
software resources repository is the

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,880
infrastructure that provided the

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,990
software resource management mechanism

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,079
to support a software reuse and the TFR

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,720
system stands for chasity software

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,439
repositories also repository is to

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,320
provide a mechanism to manage the

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,570
software resources and especially the

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,270
theater system supported the trustor

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,369
worth nice evaluation and to help users

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:05,159
to use trust the software and the thr is

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:11,489
part of the trustee project which is a

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,569
meter 863 project in China and TFR is

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,230
developed by

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,819
our University taken University and

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,599
these are the functionality is provided

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,700
by the software repository it includes

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,299
software management user management

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,609
feedback tag management chester was an

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:33,180
evaluation and some statistics of the

00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:35,670
resources and this is the homepage of

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:42,180
the system actually you can now access

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:46,409
the system we r thr 0w to dock and it

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,629
has been installed and this is the

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,939
architecture of the theater system as

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:55,859
you can see it is a layered architecture

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:57,840
and the blue is the storage layer and

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:02,180
the middle is the functional layer and

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,189
the app is the interface layer and

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,430
theater system has been widely used in

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:12,180
China and it has been stalled it has

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,719
been installed in many cities and the

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:21,449
companies who are over throughout China

00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:25,500
and last last Thursday we install we

00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:29,639
installed the theater system 40 w to

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,139
ingrid in grenoble and you can visit it

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:36,569
and now as we are discussing the quality

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,389
of the software quality i will introduce

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:44,040
some trust the roughness evaluation work

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:46,259
in TF our system and the trust the

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,900
rottenness evaluation is an important

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:53,220
part of the TF our system as you can see

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,769
in the red rectangle and actually there

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,669
are two kinds of methods to evaluate all

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,379
resources trustworthiness the first is

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,579
feedback based the trustworthiness

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:08,180
evaluation the second is internet-based

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:10,829
chest of Anthony's evaluation and

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,469
firstly we introduced the feedback based

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,799
the trust rottenness evaluation the

00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:19,949
recent iOS behind this evaluation method

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,070
is quite straightforward when I want to

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,289
use a software resource I will choose

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,880
the one that has been recommended or I

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,480
did

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,900
I'd trustworthy by other users in other

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,300
words users feedbacks are important kind

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,180
I would foster of the evidence moreover

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,020
if the user is trustworthy for example

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,020
he is an expert in some domain his pet

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,390
vax is more likely to be trustworthy so

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,970
we collect the users feedback sin ti

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,000
system and provide feedback appease the

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,520
trustworthiness evaluation to help users

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,300
to find and the uses of the where

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,460
resources and the feedback the piece de

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,520
tras la fenice evaluation is based on

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,830
the fixed feedback functionality in TF

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,100
our system absolutely there are two

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,530
kinds of feedbacks supported in theater

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,350
system the first is the simple feedback

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,250
you can provide a reading or some

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,890
comment directly the second kind is the

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,530
template based feedback you can provide

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,870
a detailed quality details of the

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,120
software resource for example you can

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,890
provide the stability is the securities

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,310
the probabilities of the software and

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:41,510
you can submit to the TFI system and the

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,510
procedure of the FB te is like this till

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,210
the tiara or the ministry to assign some

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,350
trust to Rodney's evaluation experts and

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:54,530
then the experts provide their feedbacks

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,860
based on the quality template and then

00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:00,740
the TF administrator come from these

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,870
feedbacks and the latest overall rating

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,510
is taking as the software world sausage

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,090
trust worthiness level and it is quite

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,670
straightforward and but it is widely

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,600
used in different software repositories

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:18,620
and photos and it is both healing in

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,750
number system as well and the second

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,810
kind of evaluation method is

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,030
internet-based trust worthiness

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,180
evaluation and the background is like

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,970
this software resources are changing and

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,960
they are changing from closed the static

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,990
code like resources to open dynamic

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,630
service from resources and

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,600
on the other hand with the development

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,760
of web 2.0 they are more emo if we're

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,620
missing on the internet for example

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,600
users would like to provide their

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,420
feedbacks after using a software

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,540
resources on different portals for

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,600
example these are the comments are

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,180
collected from the sector which click

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,510
the web services and these are some

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,840
comments provided by users after is

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:12,050
using the web service and what we are

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,440
doing is to try to collect these these

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:18,770
informations scattering on the internet

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,930
and the collected them into the theater

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,510
system and use this information to

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:29,120
evaluate the software resources Chester

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:32,030
botanist this is the free firm work from

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,610
this we read the shaft or resource list

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,070
from the theater system and then when

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,890
collected related information from the

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,110
internet and with these information we

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,290
extract the transitory evidences and

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:49,370
install them into the database and the

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,740
with these if these evidences and the

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,880
trustworthiness evaluation model we can

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:59,420
evaluate the resources trust the

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,700
roughness and the ticking web services

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,520
for example this framework is quite

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,710
similar to the above one so I will skip

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:12,320
this framework and actually we collect

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,520
diverse kinds of transitory evidences

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,350
for web services for example we collect

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,070
objective which has 20 the evidences

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:25,070
like the cute in fact we implement a

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,310
cute monitor which evokes every service

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,220
in the software repository on a regular

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,920
basis and with these invocations we can

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,870
calculate the quality of the cues of the

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,120
web service for example its stability

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,790
it's a response time and its

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,480
availability and the second we collect

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:48,530
the subjective evidences namely the

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,930
reputation we use we calculate our

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,020
services reputation with the users

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,600
feedbacks

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,360
and as mentioned about there are two

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,760
kinds of feedbacks ratings and comments

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,170
ratings are numbers so they can be

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,480
calculated directly and the comments are

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,420
R 3 R rating in natural languages and

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,570
they can't be calculated directly so we

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:16,710
apply centimeter analyzes to the

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,230
comments for example these are the

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,100
comments are collected from the internet

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:26,670
and after centimeter analysis we can see

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,680
this is a per little comment and then we

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:34,440
assign the +1 value to the comment and

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:38,040
and this is a negative comment so we

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,900
assign minus 1 to the comment so by

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,180
applying centimeter analyzes we can

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:49,020
calculate our services reputation with

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,390
the use of you got speed bags for

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,720
example this is a demo this is a web

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,300
service named IP to do you use apply the

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,310
IP address anything and the service will

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:05,490
return you the geolocation information

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,050
of the IP address and these are the key

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,060
with information collected for the

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,890
service and these after the feedbacks

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,280
collected a former the internet and

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,080
these are converted evidences with all

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,810
the information we can evaluate the

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,810
Soviet trust the rottenness level and

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:26,190
the last I will introduce the passing la

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,830
pasen lab data center this work is this

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:33,510
work is done by me widow and under

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:37,860
growing in our lab what you see is doing

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,200
is trying to understand the past and the

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,920
pasta with the soft open source software

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,470
community and try to learn some best

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,370
practices and I try to predict the

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:54,140
future and these are some example or

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:57,480
questions they are they are researching

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,120
the frost is how people reuse code over

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,070
time the second is which code is reused

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,790
the most often and that the third is

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,820
whatever to beautifully have and to

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,360
to study the these questions we have to

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,390
build we have to collect the collecting

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,140
open source data so what is we are doing

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:22,920
is to collect open source data and we

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:27,750
provide an infrastructure to two of

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:31,050
other research this is the method we are

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:34,440
we are using a week collected the

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,180
information from the internet and these

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,010
are the information collected in the

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,380
includes the infant data and the

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,630
activity tenta and these other royalty

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,810
has collected from the internet and the

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:49,140
piracy some scripts we can I was we can

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:54,030
extract more information we belong to

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:56,220
different levels and we are keep track

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,980
keep tracking wireless commercial and

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:03,360
open source project which includes the

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,430
poison control systems the issue

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,440
tracking system and the email archives

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,890
and these are the some are some

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,050
statistics of the files we have

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:17,490
collected you can see that we have

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:20,310
collected over 36 milling files from

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,550
source ports and this is quite a lot of

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,830
data and these are the machines and the

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,780
storage for the data actually I think

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,920
there are all there are several

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,650
terabytes of open source data as in in

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,250
the in the lab and it is open for and

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:43,250
available for researchers and these are

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:47,150
the Divas data levels and this is the

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:52,280
this is the address of the person lab

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:54,840
and these are some related websites and

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,230
actually all the systems I mentioned

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,660
about open source and you can download

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:05,190
it and you can modify it and you can use

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,250
it for free thank you

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,250
