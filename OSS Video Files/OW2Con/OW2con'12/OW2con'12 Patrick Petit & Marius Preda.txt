Description: 
	XLcloud: Remote rendering for games and 3D graphics applications in the cloud - Patrick Petit, Bull & Marius Preda, Telecom SudParis 
Abstract : The XLcloud project proposes a cutting-edge high performance cloud computing environment that enables low-latency remote rendering of 3D and complex 2D applications such as online gaming, cultural artifacts visualization and virtual body inspection in the cloud. Many people refer to cloud computing as managing virtual machines that run on top of an hypervisor. However, in certain circumstances, using virtualization is not desirable when applications have stringent performance requirements or need access to devices that are not supported by hypervisors like GPUs for example. However, it is still very convenient to utilize the features of a IaaS cloud such as instance management and image management for use cases that require the automated provisioning of a collection of cloud resources. As such, the main paradigm of XLcloud is based upon the ability to instantiate purpose-built virtual cluster instances that feature a collection of connected physical and virtual resources to support high-performance / low-latency video encoding and interactivity streaming artifacts. The presentation of XLcloud will provide a description of the Remote Rendering Virtual Cluster architecture with a particular emphasis on server components that are designed to enable a highly pervasive environment allowing end-users to run their 3D applications anywhere on any device. In addition, we will describe a low computational method to perform ROI-based (Region Of Interest) video encoding and adaptive streaming as well as a multi-modal representation of the images and videos (i.e. pixel vs graphics) to reduce the bit rate requirements. Finally, we will conclude with a short description of a partitioning algorithm and some implementation details.

okay so good afternoon everyone my name

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,230
is Patrick petty I work for bull and my

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,990
use is going to present himself later on

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,529
so we are going to talk about a project

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,109
x icloud project that is about remote

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,289
rendering for games and 3d graphic

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,440
application in the clouds so that's a I

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,800
mean really the specific mission

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,840
statement i would say that we are we

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,190
think through in terms of exile clouds

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,680
but in reality the scope of execs a

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,680
cloud goes a little broader than that

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,350
because we also strive to address

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,260
high-performance cloud compare immense

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,199
cloud computing in general so that we

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,530
can also run hpc types of application in

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,170
the cloud so the presentation agenda is

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,360
fairly simple and shot as we only have

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,240
15 minutes so we basically have four

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,450
slides and we are going to have some

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,250
video grease as well for you and for

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,170
those who has already know she doesn't

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:22,049
work for us we would have a light okay

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,619
so xn cloud is a collaborative project

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:30,990
very much like open blood where so it's

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:33,290
a project that was a winner cool for

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,350
project cloud for cloud computing

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,409
projects the first goal by the FSN which

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,159
is a a government body essentially as

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,549
everybody knows that subsidize part of

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,840
the development with you in this project

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:56,700
it's a 36 months project that we started

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,649
early 2012 Ongina in january the

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,560
coordinator is bull i am the project

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,619
lead everything we produce in this

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,469
project is open sores under apache v2

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,479
license and if you want to know more

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,159
about what we've done already

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,610
either certain number of resources that

00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:19,650
you can take a look at we have ripples

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:22,409
on the guitar you saw ww2 site so there

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,569
are multiple repos actually under the X

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,980
i clawed umbrella for those who are

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,810
interested there are only some

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,590
interesting pieces of software that you

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,720
can have a look including a java sdk for

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,730
OpenStack we have we are very much

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,239
affiliated to OpenStack because

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,450
OpenStack is our cloud infrastructure on

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,200
top of which we develop our projects we

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,750
have a collaborative Ouija under exile a

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,940
dog that you can take a look at although

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,239
if you are not part of the project there

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,010
won't be much to see there we have

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,859
presentations I guess that you can have

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,319
access to you as a non-member but if you

00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:05,160
want to become a member so now we could

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:08,879
suddenly open some pages for you and I

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,060
guess the third link is not the good one

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,239
it's supposed to be a jar dot other

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,440
value to this is where we end or

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,870
basically our project so everything is a

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:26,579
managing the JIRA and green upper we are

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,579
screen Stremme agile project we have

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:33,540
three months milestones and two weeks

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:37,349
print and that we so far we managed to

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,970
deliver quite a bit of results so now in

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,099
terms of presenting the team we are

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,989
eight partners in this collaboration

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:50,459
project Adam who brings an expertise in

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:54,450
the h2o2 64 mpeg-4 AVC low latency

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,750
compression algorithm boom that brings

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,549
his expertise in cloud infrastructure

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,530
distributed system architecture and hpc

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,459
cluster which is a core competency of

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,120
the company we have save a list that as

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,540
a lot of application also significant

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,730
expertise in the domain of interactive

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,729
relation of natural phenomenons and

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,340
virtual ready that brings in the

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,770
projects a lot of use cases that we want

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,539
to validate make sure that we can run

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,479
this type applique this type of

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,820
application in our clouds that includes

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,280
essentially a virtual reality

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,460
applications see I use gaming

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,100
applications like simulated environment

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,220
for fireman for instance with smoke for

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,560
instance and those games are useful

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,120
train those personals for instance those

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,330
are the type of application we are

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,250
targeting from Syria point of view st

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,669
that is an engineering school their

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,740
mission in the project is to work on the

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:04,410
business top business apps integration

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:07,880
open erp among others inria hazel is

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,020
involved in energy efficiency

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,360
developments in this project and we

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,870
already have some interesting stuff in

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:22,430
details telecom supa supa lab attorneys

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:24,419
headed by malice who's in the MPEG

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,300
standardization and video compression

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,690
and multi modality but you know more

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:37,260
about it in a few minutes c-can we used

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:39,330
to be HPC project that is expert in the

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,720
domain of massively distributed tight

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,470
tightly coupled software architecture

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,630
for interactive simulation and audible

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:55,650
you to also for the communication and

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:57,990
dissemination parts so I put together a

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,110
southern number of items that we believe

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,780
are really the key tenets and main

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,449
objectives of the project so I go

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,710
through them one by one and if you have

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:12,960
actually question during this

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,599
walkthrough you can interact me with a

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,009
partner so the main body of X I clouds

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,760
by is to provide you to cluster

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:27,020
instances on demand through assets

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,870
ECPI and a web UI so what we produce in

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,660
exile clouds are here to cluster

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,910
instances so what is the virtual cluster

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,660
but that's essentially something that I

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,710
called purpose-built platform as a

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:46,460
service environments there are a bid for

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:49,580
certain type of applications and it

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,920
essentially targeted to all the final

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,470
application that we want to run in this

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,740
purple purpose-built platform as a

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,740
service environment so one typical

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,020
application case would be the cloud

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,550
gaming applications but we also have

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,760
other application that we want to

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,700
demonstrate in our use case like HPC

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,690
virtual cluster for instance where we

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:18,410
are able to run htpc jobs on top of a

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:23,330
virtual infrastructure such as the one

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:26,480
that is provided by a OpenStack yes a

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,660
key objective is lurancy laryngeal alan

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,050
salerian see very low latency so what we

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,540
want to achieve is a point-to-point

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,480
communication round-trip below 200

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,380
milliseconds why 200 me too why 200

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,900
milliseconds because that's the time and

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,880
my use is going to spend that much

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,440
better than I can but that's basically

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,140
the the time under which you f as in as

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,910
an end user that feeling and sensation

00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:03,710
of sensitiveness of your application for

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:07,700
a game for instance if you have latency

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,990
that goes much beyond that level you'll

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:15,020
have that very bad feeling of a game

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,840
being slow and you know not moving as

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,000
you move the or interacting with you as

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,790
you interact with your devices like the

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,050
mouth and and so forth so building a

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,630
cloud infrastructure that is capable of

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,380
returning of regenerating a video or an

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,800
image

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,229
in under 200 milliseconds is a no-no for

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:43,220
us right it's a showstopper okay five

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:46,820
minutes total okay I talked to stall our

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,950
compliance so some are v 2 o's to exact

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,970
more so that those are the standards

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:55,520
that we expose in our api's via to

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,070
cluster management service API modular

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,900
layer and modular design to a low

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,090
stimulus support for many types of

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,530
applications and workloads that's the

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,420
purpose we platform-as-a-service

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,390
computing under environment that I

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,120
talked about policy base at his level

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,250
management including too much scallop

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,690
and scared on that's something that we

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,030
look at to give you an example for

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:21,980
instance we want to be able to scale up

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:25,160
and down a computer farm of compute

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,230
nodes in the HP severe to a cluster

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,860
environment for instance but also

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,470
compute resource for games business

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,940
application integration framework so

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,520
that's for service composition and

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,610
aggregation that's essentially to be

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,900
able to charge for different type of

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,750
services but they are not services

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,870
application services is like telco

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,700
services like for instance we could

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,800
charge in the context of an HP see

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,260
cluster for the number of jobs committed

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,540
or for the amount of CPU consumed by the

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,750
vehicle machines but that's the business

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,330
manager that put together the service

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,420
and get access to the metrics that will

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,490
be able to that it will use to be able

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,270
to charge the customer based on

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,340
different service bands secure external

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,680
environments our isolation store not

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,260
education and so forth is part of the

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,060
game fine growing resource usage matron

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,470
and energy efficient energy efficient

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,690
efficiency which really means produce

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,750
the most output for the discussed and it

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:34,160
really matters very much to be able to

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,020
save energy in the cloud because that

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,230
represents sixty percent of the plan of

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,770
the cost your

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,360
15 minutes already gone okay okay so as

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,000
you asked you understood actually we are

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,710
in a specific kind of applications about

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,140
the club don't be in the cloud we are

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,390
talking about interactive cloud it means

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,030
I press a button I should have the

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:56,040
answer immediately Patrick mentioned 200

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,950
milliseconds some games even require

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,470
much less than that let's understand I

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:05,100
have a diagram i hope i have it in one

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,870
in one minute let's understand why what

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,160
kind of operations we have to do in this

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,200
200 milliseconds in remote rendering or

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,170
by the way everybody now is talking

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,990
about cloud coming is something that

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,740
even the church here propose to the

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:26,070
customers we will see that there is a

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,700
difference between what does it mean

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,340
cloud gaming and remote assistant silver

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,750
assistant game however let's try to to

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,530
see what is happening in the chain

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,080
mainly we have a game that has two

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,580
components two main components

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,260
application engine game engine I'm

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,960
talking about games but in general is

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,630
about applications 3d and 2d graphics

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,850
applications and on the other side we

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:57,180
have the rendering engine we have

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,490
entries that can be AI data scene

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,590
description and once this goes in the

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,430
game what the game engine is using is

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:09,330
doing is producing an image ok what is

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:12,120
what is now what is now happening in the

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,720
remote rendering scenario is that these

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,840
images are encoded we have to reduce the

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,440
size of the data obtained to a

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,230
compressed stream that is packetized

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,750
with respect to some network protocol

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,170
transmitted to the network by a streamer

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:35,550
and on the client side we are receiving

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:39,150
this data and packet eyes and play

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,920
obtaining exactly the same image then we

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,080
have to capture the interactivity from

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,720
the user mainly keyboard and mouse and

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,650
that is not sent back to the clear but

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,460
is sent back to the server by using same

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,830
network

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,300
connection this is the user interaction

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,750
that is going in the application edge

00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,960
and the entire loop is repeated in

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,090
addition what we can have is we may have

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,850
some terminal preferences our users will

00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,380
not use the same same platform so this

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,800
terminal preferences will go in the

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:14,700
network and will somehow drive down the

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,230
game itself more than terminal

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,000
preference we may have network

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,880
preferences this is the global scenario

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,430
of remote rendering and now because in

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,480
the cloud we have as much processing

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:34,980
power us we we want the idea here is how

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,530
to mini me to minimize the latins the

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,080
main latency in this schema is coming

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,790
from the network transmission so in

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,910
general you have some agreement with a

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,060
netter operator and something special is

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,100
doing there but we can do even more we

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,220
can reduce that latency because we can

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,720
reduce the data to be transmitted and

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,930
why we can do that because we have the

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,700
power of the of the cloud so there are

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,280
additional operations that are possible

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,710
to be done i will leave some examples we

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,840
can extract a death map and input that

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,500
this map in the video encoder it will

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:14,340
run not faster but better in terms of

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,000
results then we may even analyze the

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,610
scene and by doing so we can detect some

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,890
motion vectors we will input that in the

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,170
video encoder and will not do any more

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,290
frame prediction in the video so it will

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,270
be faster even more than that we may do

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,020
a segmentation map and control the

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:37,140
quality in the in the image specifically

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:40,080
to what is important in the game even

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,480
more and this is one of the goal in in

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,460
Excel cloud we can have a kind of mixed

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
representation of the data instead of

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,570
having only pixels we may transmit to

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,430
the graphics and CD graphics because we

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,190
have the power to interpret all these

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,250
data and send probably to a graphics

00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:00,240
encoder put it in the compressed rim and

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,710
the scene the scene will go go back the

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,750
scene will continue

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,800
so this is the overall scheme on many

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,260
components are not yet available some of

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,500
them are available are even commercially

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:17,820
available and Excel cloud will advance

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:20,070
on this on this new new components here

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,240
you have two videos that are showing

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,600
actually the current situation here you

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,370
have a TV set with a very tiny set of

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,890
box that is only doing video encoder and

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:35,220
the mobile phone that is only taking the

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:38,610
input and the game itself which is

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,700
displayed here is done on another server

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,160
in the cloud there are many advantages

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,040
of rings away I'll not go there but you

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,210
have multi-platform multi-session

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,650
immediately because you have only one

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,650
