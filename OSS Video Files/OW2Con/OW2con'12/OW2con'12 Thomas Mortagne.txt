Description: 
	XWiki Extension Manager in action - Thomas Mortagne, XWiki (http://www.xwiki.com/)
AbstractÂ : XWiki team is actively working on a powerful system to extend XWiki with different type of modules with their dependencies coming from various repositories. The presentation goal is to give a state of this component and the future improvements and new features as well as an overview of the many extensions points of Extension Manager itself (support other kind of repositories, other kind of extensions, events, etc.). Also a short demonstration of various possibilities of this new component inside XWiki will be run.

	00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:09,960
so hi I'm a thermal teen I workin as a

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:13,049
committee on X wiki project and I will

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,440
talk about some new things onyx wiki

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:21,150
around the extension and how to install

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,730
and find them so a little one about so I

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,189
what I work for each week ESS as a caca

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,470
meter and next week he says is a usual

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:34,380
company based in the open source project

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,350
with a super hosting and things like

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:44,480
that so why we started to wait do we

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,480
need it to work on an extension manager

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,270
Enix wiki you have all sort of extension

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,340
it's actually a set of extension that

00:00:51,270 --> 00:01:01,190
you reunite in a distribution a bit like

00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:03,960
Linux systems so it's starting to be

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,659
growing a vehement with a lot of

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,619
extensions and it was starting to be a

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,409
bit complex to know what you can install

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,460
and also when you when you do an

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:23,310
extension you want to user access it

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,799
easily i nevah a pot on point the tix

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,950
wiki that most of what you see in X wiki

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,890
is a wiki pages that include

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:36,560
applications that are all sort of things

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,720
so where you can customize and modify

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,200
everything you see in the default xwiki

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,670
you I so when you start modifying

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,290
starter pages it what it works

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,720
great and it's a ex is done exactly

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,000
fight but when you when you want to

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,399
grade it was starting to be a nightmare

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,369
when you have a lot of modification of

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,690
star on a standard pages and we needed

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,869
to provide a way to do we win myalgias

00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,989
and conflict resolution when you have

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,989
some modification of your own you forgot

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:20,519
and you don't know really exactly what

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:29,750
you would change all the time so let's

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:32,970
see what you a bit up okay so the first

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:36,120
part of extension manager is what we

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,810
call the distribution with up so as I

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,940
said in X wiki you can build any

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,900
distribution you want we you have

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,269
extension xwiki enterprising sweetie

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,790
manager which has to default extension

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,170
but anyone can build a lot of different

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,530
products you have your key you know it

00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:02,280
you have many many product better that

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:06,269
using a quickie extension so we needed

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:10,950
to make easy when you install the seller

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:14,090
part to help the user choose the right

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,880
you I to install and also when you grade

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,519
the wall on the server side to help the

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,180
user I know what to do to finish the

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,880
upgrade and the wiki pages so when you

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,730
install a quickie you get with you I and

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,590
it explain you what you already are so

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:41,700
here we are installed xwiki extension

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:46,650
xpeke enterprise and doesn't want to go

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:50,670
down so the distribution which has been

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,510
installed and it proposed you the short

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,610
UI for this distribution and you can

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,990
instr it right away so it will download

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,110
everything in needs

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,380
so as you see you have a lot of visual

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,080
is actually a non-tree paint for a lot

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,450
of application you have by default enix

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,330
week enterprise so you have a powerful

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:21,430
dependency management system and you can

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:23,140
ultimately download and install it yeah

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,220
during the installation you have a

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:33,250
detailer log of everything that has been

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:37,120
done during the installation thinnest at

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,790
first we are guest user we need to to

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,080
log because among other thing in its

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,660
wiki even not users wiki pages and we

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:55,960
just installed some users here and we

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:58,120
lost onion right as a as a guest so here

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,310
you get everything you see here I've

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,540
just been installed downloaded and

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:12,070
installed by the distribution with them

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:15,220
so let pick an actual extension at you

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:19,960
want the laughter so you have world

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:23,770
extension manager the first thing x wiki

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,440
will do at startup is to try to find

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:32,160
everything you already have which means

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:36,730
every extension if we drive ray piece of

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,680
software you can already use and you

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,820
already have when you resolve the

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,150
differences to not be sure to install

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,740
something which is compatible with it so

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,710
here you have a lot of things coming

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,940
from the ex wiki wall package and you

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,410
have also all the job coming with

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,470
whatever application server you

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,590
installed is here it's a GT for example

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:07,900
so if you have an extension which depend

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,300
on a jackrabbit for example it's a

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,440
and we will not try to download it again

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,610
and also if you need a different version

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,310
of what's already in the class loader it

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:27,940
will educate you that it's not

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:30,880
compatible with with this version so

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,100
here you find all the all the extension

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,470
we just installed by the with the

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,080
distribution wisdom so all these are

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:43,000
exact extension which means a bike a

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:47,050
Jewess with wiki pages and then and you

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,370
can install and upgrade them here when

00:06:47,050 --> 00:07:00,820
when there is a new version and you can

00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:04,570
search for new extension so for example

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,759
are you have your values extension

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,729
extension I did for the demo and a lot

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,520
of extension coming from extension that

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,250
the ex wicked at all which is a

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,639
repository with which is open to

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:25,780
everyone to publish extension which end

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:32,650
up in all xwiki instances so let's

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:34,990
install this one and you see it depends

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,539
on another extension which is not

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,690
installed yet either which is a

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,060
presentation to build in next time

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,710
chancery to build presentation and

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:52,349
display them to the present is actual

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:59,830
presentation so as a just html5

00:07:52,349 --> 00:08:05,680
presentation to to display oh wow so

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:09,360
that's another side ok so we get the

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,599
presentation we are all ready and let's

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,060
goes to a summary of all the feature you

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,669
get in an extension manager so the

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,350
the first part and the important part is

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:26,150
like you can install and it's dull

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:29,900
upgrade downgrade etc and any extension

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,690
which is for now we support exam and jaw

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,940
extensions when you on Stella Chow you

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,120
don't have to restart when you insert it

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:42,529
you know how to restart it will be

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,160
applying right away exam icky pages or

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:48,529
forum it's not a big issue in either you

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,080
have a powerful dependency management so

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,330
you can have any extension depending on

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,390
a new very extension coming from values

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,700
repositories for example you can have an

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:04,000
extension an extension the ticket at all

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:09,140
which need to get some gel from the

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:17,630
melvins and harbor the trees get multi

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:20,089
wikis stay then ok so we're so you are

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,370
also a support for melvin a quickie

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,730
repository for funnel which mean you can

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:29,000
add to the XP confusion any mavin

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,170
repository whether it's the mother and

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,820
son horrible tiny of your repository and

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,480
also the tool based on unix wiki and

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,750
which you have a repository manager rui

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,460
to to upload extension is when we use in

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,490
extension that you quickly learn for

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:50,330
example network you can install you on

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:57,760
anywhere and on everything you have in

00:09:50,330 --> 00:10:01,610
this fri mark accept exile extension and

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,770
the ex wiki specific you I it's all

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,410
usable outside of your quickie like

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,510
things like expect Iran during you can

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,760
use all these ramrod dependency

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,980
management and joints duration and still

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:21,050
and things like that I would say the

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:24,080
Fenian a java java project basically you

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:28,520
have two main points of extension in a

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,590
extension manager to add new feature you

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,690
can earn you

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:36,630
extension unless and a new repository

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:40,900
type unless to those are some IDs

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:44,680
example Enix wiki you can use the Python

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:48,640
micro as Ruby macro which is based on

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,480
which other scripting system so we can

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,960
imagine install Python packages or

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,590
rabigh packages director Enix wiki from

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,280
extension manager the same way you could

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,220
get this extension from PI pi repository

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,830
which is a reference repository from

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,160
Python packages you are the same for

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:20,070
Ruby with ruby gem and we could also

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:22,960
imagine i think it's the last one use a

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,000
support act factory nexus and things

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,370
like that to have more advanced search

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,290
feature on madden repository because you

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,280
can search and playing madden rhetoric

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:37,560
repository nasa things like that okay

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,560
and let's all farm

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,720
