	00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:19,020
good morning ladies ladies yes gentlemen

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:22,199
so 15 minutes if I've if I got it just

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,050
15 minutes then you push me out so I

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,529
will try to be straight to the point so

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,769
I would like just in the next 15 minute

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,770
to share with you why as a new company

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,670
at the started company we made some

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,210
choice at EG choice regarding the open

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,680
source software i'm not trying to

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,950
convince you because i know that as a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,930
community and such knowledgeable people

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,270
i don't need to convince you i just want

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,100
to share with you why we have made that

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,050
strategic choice and in order to

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,570
understand it I need to share with you

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,020
some market analysis that we have done

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,960
because we are startup as I told you but

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,840
a special one I would say because our

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,380
shareholder invested 300 million dollar

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,430
to create an infrastructure as a service

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:19,950
company so the market we are tackling

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:23,159
targeting is the EIS market so in order

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,619
to make some choice in terms of

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,049
technology we try to analyze the market

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,780
and to understand the first thing is it

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:35,030
the cloud computing revolution or just a

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,710
technology evolution a new cycle and we

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,180
came to the conclusion and we share that

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,790
conclusion of course with a lot of

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,240
people that it's really a revolution for

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:50,450
three reason because there is three main

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,729
forces which sustain the cloud computing

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,759
today the first one is yes it's a new

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:02,280
technology cycle but it's not only a new

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:05,340
technology cycle I've here look back the

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,039
40 50 years and you can see that every

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,340
every 10-15 years you have

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,310
a new technology cycle the mainframe the

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,260
mini the mini computing the micro

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,840
computing then you have the Internet in

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,790
the mid of the 90s and in the middle of

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,790
the two thousand was what I call the

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,459
communication everywhere anytime so what

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,790
is important is to understand that

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,329
behind the technology there is two

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:38,579
forces which are sociological forces and

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:44,189
individual forces first there is a power

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:46,439
shift from the data center manager from

00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:50,669
the the CIO the chief information

00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:53,609
officer and the the goal of the CIO to

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:56,430
the end user for those of you who

00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:59,720
remember how it was in the 70s basically

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:04,430
as a user if you want to express a need

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,359
you have to queue and wait for the CIO

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,489
decision and the decision was often guys

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,519
come within the next 12 months and we

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,430
may have an answer for you and that

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,639
that's why it was a frustration for the

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,060
end user and that's the main reason why

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,400
the microcomputer came in the in the

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,479
beginning of the 80s at the back of the

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,609
CIO and if you look we'll push the

00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,280
company to a pen to the internet the

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,579
entire face it's the user it's not the

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,790
CIO decided to open to the internet

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:46,530
world their own company and if you look

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:49,139
now in the 2000 will basically push to

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,680
get the smartphone the tablets connected

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:57,120
to the company it's again the user so

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,040
there is a padding shift where because

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,209
the user is much more knowledgeable

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,159
today than it was 30 years ago it can

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,470
dictate what you want and how you want

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,989
it if you look at the social network

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,209
every large company is talking about an

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,180
internal social network but it's coming

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,590
from the from the user that's that's

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,450
very very important because it's

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,570
partying shift within the company and

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,310
the second the

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:26,890
the third force is basically again back

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,840
in the 70s beginning of the 80s it was

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,520
quite easy you know when we were used

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:37,000
leave the enterprise we enter in private

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,570
our private wall and until the next day

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,630
we stay in the private war but today the

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,600
border between what is private and what

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,500
is the the professional life completely

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,680
disappear and the two will emerge and it

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,650
has been of course L by the mobility and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,660
by the communication the ability to be

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,930
always connected connected to your

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,590
private data private interest but also

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:09,520
connected to your professional life so

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,260
that three forces basically conveyor but

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,540
we have to keep in mind also in which

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,530
environment we are today and we have

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,630
again to to element which basically

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,090
stricture the the market today one is

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,760
the economical pressure that we have

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,160
every company is under pressure from an

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,190
economic standpoint so basically you

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,100
have to deliver more with less and it's

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,020
also a pressure which basically is put

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,750
on the CIO in the in the company but

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,740
also we are facing an environment where

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,800
basically whatever we're doing we have a

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,760
digital footprint so this digital

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,150
footprint are collected and are

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,760
generated a lot of data and all of our

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,400
view you are you convened at the big

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,620
data is also part of that revolution you

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,070
know because with all this data you can

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,500
get information you can get knowledge

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,550
and basically you can define new

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,590
business model to bring solution to some

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,350
customer in the market so we are in an

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,520
environment where basically all those

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:23,440
forces converge to generate a new way to

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,690
do things and it's why we think that as

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,210
a company that the cloud is here and

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,570
it's a descriptive not only disruptive

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,990
technology it's a disruptive way to do

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,840
things for pride

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,850
people for companies for professionals

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,510
but we try to define there is a lot of

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:47,750
you know companies which claimed to be

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,940
Cloudant ready or cloud services so we

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,190
have defined three criteria in order to

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,830
say yes if you answer yes to dance three

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,770
criteria there is a chance that you are

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,710
really a cloud service provider so the

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,480
first one is you pay as you go meaning

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,210
that if you don't choose you don't pay

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,640
anything so if you have to pay a monthly

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,460
fee or yearly fee it's not a cloud

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,300
services because the main the main

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,870
change in terms of the way you consume

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,990
the vit the IT services is the fact that

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,810
you pay as you go the second point is

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,280
the the elasticity meaning that if you

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,050
have an application that application

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,350
runs on an infrastructure and the

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,450
application needs more power more

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:36,110
storage more compute kappa b kappa

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,840
cities should get it right away but more

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:44,540
important if the application does not

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,150
need that level of compute then you can

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,970
release these capacities so it's a

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,570
question of elasticity up and down at

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:57,620
any time and the third point is the fact

00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,700
that there's their services should be

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,190
you know consumed in a very simple way

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,260
through a self-service approach should

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,210
buy through cell service you should buy

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,960
their services consume that services

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,240
build on their services to generate a

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,810
new a new solution for the market you

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:23,950
want to address so what is interesting

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:26,390
to to understand does di te market is

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,030
going through a specific you know

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:32,720
pattern not at all because if you look

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,780
around us in fact you see that it's a

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,320
when when an industry reach a level of

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,440
maturity in their usage they start to

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,440
enter in a in

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,390
in a way to do their business which is a

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,550
mutual ization I don't know if them

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,110
English word you know but a mutual

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,330
approach meaning that you share you

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,700
share the infrastructure you share the

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,520
services you share everything if you go

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,350
in an old tale you book a room you use

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,450
the room you pay for the room you don't

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,320
pay anything else you pay additional

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,820
services eventually it's the same in in

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,830
France you have two example here with

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,170
bicycle and cars where basically you can

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:14,170
use a car you can use a bicycle and you

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,630
have to pay for the usage you have so my

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,500
point is it's something which is not new

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,390
and even when you look at our industry

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,030
when I said that the infrastructure goes

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,920
through a consumerization process it's

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,010
back to the electricity if you go back

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,560
to the the beginning of the 20th century

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,330
the end of the 19th century basically

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,060
when you are building a manufacturing

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:41,290
plant with the manufacturing plant you

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,240
were building and power electricity you

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,150
know entity to provide the electricity

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,630
for the plant and only 10 20 30 years

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:52,560
later they start to stop to do that and

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,870
share their power because some

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,200
specialized companies appear to provide

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,640
as des energy it's exactly what happened

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,460
in our industry in a sense you know

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,560
because we are used to have an

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,330
enterprise if you go to the basement or

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,190
to the first floor you have the data

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,290
center for the enterprise with their

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,560
dedicated server dedicated storage

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,750
dedicated network we will go through the

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,230
same process you know the data center

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,210
moved out and at the outsourcing was the

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,570
first step because with the outsourcing

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,700
you are keeping the ownership of you own

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,339
infrastructure but you were sharing the

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,290
knowledge of the of the community so

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,240
still five minutes so we like just to

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,180
share with you in that environment what

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,550
we what we are doing basically what we

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,440
say okay how could win that business

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,240
which is a consumerization of the

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,120
infrastructure which means that we need

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,920
to be high-volume low-cost and we came

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,150
to the conclusion that in order to stay

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,520
over time very efficient

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,290
from a cost perspective and from an

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,800
innovation perspective which mean how to

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:06,140
differentiate ourselves we need to own

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,990
our architecture we need to avoid to be

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,600
locked in by a supplier because if at

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,930
one point in time we could be fine or

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,450
happy with what is providing we depend

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,730
on his road map and if at one point in

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,490
time it goes left where we think we

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,410
should go right we are locked in and you

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,130
know how much it costs when you want to

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,760
be out of that clock so basically the

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,860
first decision was we need to be open

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,870
open software and that's what we have

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,140
done and basically we made some choices

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,090
but we as I told you in a new company we

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:45,530
were lucky enough to start from a white

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:48,170
page so we could define the DNA of the

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:53,120
company and we we put some attribute

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:55,310
which basically are very simple I will

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,440
not talk too much about the security

00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,870
it's obvious that as an elf a secure

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,940
provider you need to be secure that's a

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,770
key a key element of genetic but I would

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,650
like just highlight transparency

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:10,700
reversibility which are absolutely key

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:16,880
and we we are getting that by using open

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:20,180
software so the low-cost aspect means we

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,310
need to be over time you know able to

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,590
provide services at the cost which is

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,710
expecting from the customer and at the

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:31,810
price which is expected by the customer

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,270
which mean that over time we need to to

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:38,810
basically be able to make our

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:41,000
environment evolve but and our own

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,850
decision not on the under the decision

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,610
and the pricing of a supplier so what we

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:52,130
have done we form the framework at the

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,520
operating level see we decided to go

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:59,830
OpenStack and we are now part of the

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,020
OpenStack community so for for our

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,570
e-commerce site we selected prestashop

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,000
for the CRM system we select

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,160
Sugar CRM and you have the other choice

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,890
we have made but what is important what

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,280
we have done we selected a number of

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,990
partners to help us to develop the

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,630
system because what we are expecting

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,870
from being part of the open community is

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,390
of course to share the air and D to

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,060
share the maintenance costs and to share

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,070
the integration costs so being part of

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,060
foil as being part of the open community

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,950
means to to take and give back to the

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,990
community there is no way you can take

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,880
without giving back otherwise you're not

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,630
part of the community you start to be a

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,460
popular system so it's our in our DNA in

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,100
order to stay transparent to stay

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,530
reversible we need to be part of the

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,240
open community meaning that we need to

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,020
respect the attribute of the community

00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:03,710
and that's something we have done in and

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:05,900
put in our DNA 15 minute gone so if

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:12,230
there is question later i'm here for the

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:13,850
entire morning thank you as excellent

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,910
thank you very much Patrick thank you

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,400
for and for abiding for by be 15 minutes

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:24,290
you still had another 30 seconds you

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:27,860
know ok and I'll remember Aurra we

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,110
recall that to own what to innovate in

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,110
large volume and low-cost business you

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,540
need to own infrastructure that's key

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,510
lesson we'll think about that and open

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:43,310
source allows you to do that our next

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:46,490
speaker is really there and is one of

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,450
our sponsors from OpenSocial I'm very
