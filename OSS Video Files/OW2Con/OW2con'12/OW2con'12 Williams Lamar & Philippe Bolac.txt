	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,269
hello so I'm Lamar Williams and I'm with

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,460
Aunt link so what we see as the

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,890
challenges that many companies are

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:20,150
facing within the supplier chain is many

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,920
factories are developing software and

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:27,810
integrating that into new products and

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,810
so Oh w2 believes as we do that managing

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:36,360
software integration is obviously

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:40,410
important so which is why they've

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:46,829
included us in the squat with pathology

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:51,510
ant pedia reporter is our product and we

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:55,260
are doing a lot of code analysis of

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:00,180
what's actually integrated into a

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,539
specific code that is being scanned so

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,210
far sala g on one side is doing license

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:12,750
analysis and we're taking it a little

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:16,140
more in detail so anta Peter reporter

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,110
and foss ecology combined provide a

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,110
best-in-class solution for your software

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,640
development teams and how that works is

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:32,100
fossil adji on one side is doing a very

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,470
static scan of your software as far as

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,369
license and bringing in the copyright

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,860
information on a local level and ant p

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,460
your reporter takes it and does a bit

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,070
more of a dynamic scan and brings in

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,110
more than two million open source

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,070
components that it's scanning it against

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,750
on our knowledge base so it's giving it

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,759
a bit more detail the license

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:03,180
information and potential

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:06,540
vulnerabilities so once you get into an

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,459
speedy reporter this is one of the first

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,459
pages that you're going to see is the

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,740
Bill of Materials report and from here

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,510
the bill of materials

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,910
is bringing in the information that was

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:23,490
just scanned as far as components and

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,610
the dependencies of the components and

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,410
it's bring it in here in specifying it

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:35,420
into separate categories as you can see

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:40,200
from open source to proprietary software

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,180
your your internal software and also an

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,350
undefined area which is things that

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,710
weren't found on anta pedia or under

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,410
facility so from here you can actually

00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:56,610
see the dependencies area what it's

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,970
bringing out is version name excuse me

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,070
version license you can see Foss ologies

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,700
license what it got from that specific

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,730
component and the copyright information

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,770
from an to Peter reporter and from

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:16,830
pathology and where fossil adji does not

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,740
bring in information that's where anta

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,140
pedia picks up the rest so if it's not

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,660
found on the local level of the specific

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,160
component when we research the ant p and

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,430
knowledge base which is bringing in a

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,100
lot of third-party information you'll be

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:38,520
able to see that in the BLM bill of

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:41,070
materials so the next page is where you

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,950
can actually modify and customize your

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,190
Bill of Materials report so here you

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,660
have many different policy license

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,720
information and it's integrated into an

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,440
to Peter reporter so that you're able to

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,180
simply select users policy and that'll

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,360
become your my policy for that

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,840
particular project that you've scanned

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,360
so if we were to pick say proprietary

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,610
compliance and use that as policy that

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,370
will be listed in your my policy area

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,510
for any project that you're scanning in

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,750
the future we plan on making that

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:24,690
specific to individual projects but at

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,060
the moment it's you just can select one

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,860
and use it across all projects

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,710
okay and just so you know all the policy

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:44,400
license information is based off of SPD

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:46,950
x formats okay so aunt PD reporter also

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,250
gives you an interactive tree map which

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:53,460
is under our release view and so what

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:56,520
this allows you to do is drill down into

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,970
specific information in the code that

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,550
you've scanned so or in the project that

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,460
you've actually been looking at and so

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:09,330
it breaks it down by dependency file and

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,030
folder so the color coding is actually

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,750
based off of the previous screen where

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,700
its showing the the license policy that

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,580
you've actually selected and it's

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,700
bringing it in here so it gives you a

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,500
clear map of your entire project and

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,910
allows you to drill down into specific

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,190
areas so similar to as you would look at

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,250
on your computer screen if you look to

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,610
the left hand side here you can actually

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,500
click on drop-down menus to bring the

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,470
specific folders out and see the files

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,900
within and with that you can actually

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,660
activate it so that it shows up into the

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,550
tree map area as well and then below you

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,680
can see the history of the releases of

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,360
those files so you can get more

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,910
information in the lower area and also

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,720
get the actual file path by just

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,850
clicking on CNN to pedia and to Peter

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:15,419
URL or view the content within a

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:19,050
specific dependency so this is one of

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:22,260
our newest areas of ants Peter reporters

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,190
dashboard so this is the summary area

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:29,070
where you can get the percentage and a

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,080
numeric value of your specific project

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,590
as far as how much or open sources

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,380
within it and it's really a great

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,910
visualization tool for say your

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,770
management team too

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:47,100
you start meetings and provide them

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,660
specific information on the particular

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,460
project so that you don't actually have

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,390
to look at the Bill of Materials report

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,420
they can see where it's where specific

00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,260
information is ending up in and it also

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:09,860
gives you the security level on the

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:12,840
vulnerabilities so so when we get to

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,000
anta pedia anta PD is a free and public

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,730
site so you're able to go there just by

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,540
going to enter Viacom and it's bringing

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,450
in more than two million open source

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,990
projects and components from google code

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,270
github various source repositories are

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,240
funneling into anta pedia which is

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,400
giving it its name which is the world's

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,210
largest knowledge base of open source

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,740
projects so from here you can do a lot

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,400
of searching and this is what's actually

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,950
funneling into an to Peter reporter and

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:53,100
giving you the Bill of Materials report

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:56,640
and the interactive tree map so again

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,580
with fossil adji you're able to activate

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,860
this pathology scan within ant Peter

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,980
reporter this was not available before

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,830
they were two separate solutions and now

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,100
they're coming together so that you get

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,720
the most of your scanning ability and so

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,260
you can either choose to do that on an

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,020
ant appiah server or you can do it

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:23,900
through the oh w to foss ecology servers

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:27,630
so depending on what you prefer on doing

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:32,039
so together it's providing a

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:35,250
comprehensive solution for your o w to

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:38,550
mature projects so here is just an

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,820
example of what information you'll

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,940
actually get so from the tree map the

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,310
Bill of Materials the dashboard and the

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,920
specific instances which are listed

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,510
above this is actually not available yet

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,630
it'll should be available in the next

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,720
three days or so

00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,269
but you can see a demo of that

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,959
information which is at demo Dan speedy

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:07,649
accom okay so you're going to come into

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,510
this as a guest user and what you'll

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:12,630
actually do is go ahead and click on

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,240
sign in as guest and it's going to pull

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,279
up the various well this would actually

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,459
be 0 W to information and so you can see

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,699
the specific projects here and the

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,500
version so if you click on this one here

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:32,720
it'll open up and you'll actually get

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,250
your dashboard so as you can see there's

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,990
percentages here you can choose your

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,060
different variables if you want to see

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,440
it by file or by dependencies so we keep

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,399
that and then it'll bring up your

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,820
various percentages and numerical values

00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,949
here okay and so if you go to the Bill

00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:02,579
of Materials report and you actually

00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:04,680
click on say a file or a component it'll

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:10,560
come up below with all the dependencies

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,139
for that specific file dependency and so

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,970
you can get the copyright information

00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:16,290
you can see here as far as the license

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,649
instead of concern this is what's

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,250
pulling from anta pedia and this here

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:26,370
would be from fossil adji so where you

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,529
don't see the false ology information

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,339
than to Pia reporter has brought that in

00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:34,380
and we're there our matches that does

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:39,540
help you in understanding well you know

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:43,050
I'm up to date with this portion or if

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,079
you needed to double check on I don't

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,420
know if we can actually do drop-down

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:52,620
columns you can add specific columns to

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:57,360
this and you can get the latest version

00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:01,649
also so you can see this particular file

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,779
dependency is up to date okay and then

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,080
if you go obviously if you go to the

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,510
release page you can definitely

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,610
down into specific information and this

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,120
will come up in the below area when you

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:17,660
click on various dependencies there and

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,750
then when i was talking here if you open

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:24,380
up a folder and you want to see this

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:28,430
this particular dependency you'll say

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,140
display entry map and that those areas

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,450
will actually come up here and you can
