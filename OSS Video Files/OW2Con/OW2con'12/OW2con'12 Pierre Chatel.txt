Description: 
	CHOReOS: Large Scale Choreographies for the Future Internet, from theory to practice - Pierre Chatel, Thales. Abstract : The CHOReOS 'Large Scale Choreographies for the Future Internet' European FP7 project that started 2 years ago, and is linked to OW2 Future Internet initiative, has now reached a certain level of maturity that is starting to gives concrete answers on how to move from choreography enactment theory, to its actual practice. More precisely, CHOReOS has defined several methods, toolkits and artifacts to enable this innovative distributed way of coordinating services, while at the same time dealing with some of the inherent difficulties to enacting choreographies in an [Ultra] Large Scale context. For instance, this covers being able to 'execute' choreography specifications over a network of discovered, dynamic, Business and Thing-based services. This presentation will cover the aforementioned topics and specific CHOReOS developments that were undertaken in its second year, while putting them in perspective of a simple practice-oriented and business-driven use-case in Air-Traffic Management.

we will not talk about the foundations

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,649
of curves will talk about its theory and

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,400
moving from theory to practice and

00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,620
kurose is about large-scale

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,300
choreographies for the friend zone I'm

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,160
personally I'm piaccia Tara and I work

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,580
for today's advanced to this in the

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,710
smart system lab what is caused one big

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,570
question it's a choreography is

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,920
Enrique's away for services and things

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,199
and why do we know that because we need

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,779
to sustain the centralized service

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,189
choreographies in order to support the

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,910
future internet and large-scale

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,280
properties and specifically in coils we

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,940
have a focus on internet of service or

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,730
iOS and Internet of Things and how do we

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,899
do that we do that by introducing a

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,340
specific development process n an idea

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,469
reintegrated development and runtime

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,809
environment and this is for the

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,629
coordination of services through these

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,149
choreographies and you can see here in

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,640
the diagram that chaos is at the center

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,920
of the concerns between filter internet

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,270
and a large-scale let's say large-scale

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,560
not equal to a large scale for now so

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,110
this is a brief outline of the

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,000
presentation I will quick quickly do a

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,340
small reminder on what is the difference

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,020
of the main differences between

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,020
orchestration geographies then going to

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,939
a use case and some extract of the

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,890
contributions that we are made in coils

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,740
from the last two years we won't have

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,070
the time to do a pan overview of all the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,210
contributions just the main ones so

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,329
orchestrations versus choreographies in

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,970
a real one so orchestration are like a

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,850
local or this centralized perspective

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,369
you could say that as you have here on

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,759
the left that each player in our Kestra

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,159
need to strictly follow instructions

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,829
that are coming from a conductor and in

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,680
the SOA war this conductor will be the

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,729
orchestrator the orchestrator that reads

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,649
at one time constants a BP people file

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,990
so it refers to a specific business

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,270
process with a specific goal or business

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,740
goal on the other hand that

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,200
you have under on the right here a

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,510
choreography is a global or distributed

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,470
perspective and you could say that then

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,540
so dance following a global scenario and

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,080
without a single point of control

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,390
without this orchestrator so in SOAD

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,730
describe a protocol for direct

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,740
peer-to-peer interaction direct without

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,630
the orchestrator and this is the main

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,850
difficulty that we have in Crows how to

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,480
do add to do that without the

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,730
orchestrator choreographies help us deal

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,480
with what we call feature internet it is

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,730
like scalability heterogeneity in the

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,880
diversity of services user types

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:56,820
mobility and also our nest and

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:58,830
adaptability so all these it is and in

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,290
coils we have projection of

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,720
choreographies in three different use

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,700
cases I will focus on one in the airport

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,470
it's called passenger from the airport

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,200
and the context is air from air

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,600
transportation service to passengers we

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,520
want to do improvements of services to

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,830
this passenger to improve also the 3d

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,070
tea inside the airport and we do a proof

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,410
of concept on that and correos enables

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,020
us to do dynamic reminding and

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,090
replacement of services so based on

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,240
loose coupling and also distributed

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,090
coordination we have telus in area and

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,160
Lynn ago hot that contributes to this

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,920
use case for instance land-grab provides

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:44,400
the GSB push for communication and we we

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,830
follow a passenger from home to its

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,190
London landing and this is a bpmn

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,990
diagram that show the sub part on the

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,300
landing of the passengers inside the

00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,700
airports so its passengers are evil and

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,209
ring and tracking inside the airport I

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,370
will quickly zoom here so I think that

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,030
you are not able to see much here but

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,580
this is a bpmn to choreography that we

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,580
do using magic draw that is used in the

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,890
chorus project each task here is a

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,169
direct communication between multiple

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,400
players for instance here between the

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,620
airport and the passengers and the

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,350
main thing in this choreography is that

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,810
on the left side the passengers have not

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,720
landed and on the right side we are able

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,880
to dynamically incorporate the service

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,539
that are provided by the passengers

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,180
smartphones like a service for measuring

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,039
the ambient noise level or the location

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,690
of passengers so the service provided by

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,810
the smart phones are directly

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,130
incorporated in the global choreography

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,259
like dog services that are already

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,229
inside the airport like to display the

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:58,660
public displays or the microphones etc

00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:00,850
so this is the the main focus here so

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,699
let's look at some of the things that

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,650
allows us to do that the eye dr e a

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,620
specific cause development process and

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,250
what we call kagra synthesis the eye dr

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,710
e is the thing that is at the center

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,080
that integrates all coils components

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,090
into one single platforms you have

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,610
formally grounded abstractions and

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,919
models you have a dynamic coefficient

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,960
track development process a middleware

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,419
and governors verification and

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,400
validation so the idea is the packaging

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,360
that at the end of the project will

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:39,310
allow you here to checkout coils and to

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,770
give to twitch wave a single package the

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,550
specific development process which is

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,590
part here of the eye dr e and the middle

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,349
well we'll see now so first of all the

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,250
development process it's a

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,650
technologically independent

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,020
characterization of the strategy that we

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,240
use during the car graphy lifecycle it's

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,000
nothing very new because its usual

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,530
software definition activities like goal

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,050
and requirement specification

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,659
verification and validation model to

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,250
model transformation but they are

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:14,800
structured in a course specific way and

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,970
we do that we specify this using the

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,590
same language that we use for

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,300
choreography in fact so it's a little

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,280
bit fact I'll we use a VPN to here and

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,580
this is the abstract view and this is

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,639
the detail view with a lot of task you

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,550
have the production's the type of

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,830
documents that

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,200
Rose consumed and the type of documents

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,900
that are produced and all the tasks so I

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,650
invite you to check out this discourse

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,350
process in more details in on the

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,000
website I will just focus today on this

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:53,310
part which is the choreography synthesis

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,130
so how does it work it is the main focus

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,040
them this domain core of coils that

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,900
allows us to run choreographies so we

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,850
move from a bpmn to choreography

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,290
specification like the one you saw

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:10,020
before and to synthesis of artifacts to

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,690
that allows runtime of this choreography

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,510
and of course also discovery of the

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,030
available services so the first step is

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,250
moving from the pmn to suffocation and

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,440
apply model to model transformations and

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,750
we obtained with what is called a

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,230
choreography labeled state transition

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,390
system of CLTS this is in fact the

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,820
global coordination logic that is

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,600
specified in the choreography at the

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,900
global level then we need to project

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:43,320
this global single choreography logic in

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,620
to multiple expected participants so we

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,530
obtained by transformation sub C LTSs

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,780
and this is the expected participant

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,700
behavior this is not the actual services

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,100
this is the behavior that we want to

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,470
obtain from services and finally of

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,900
course we need to discover the available

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,690
services and produce what is called

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,000
coordination delegates or CDs this

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,030
coordination delegates are the code java

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,850
code in fact that is produced based on

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:15,380
the automatons that are producers here

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,480
the CLT esas are in fact state machines

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,990
so state machines and then code

00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,810
generation to obtain CDs and this city's

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,420
will manage the available services at

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,590
runtime based on the global coordination

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,100
logic that is not lost in the process

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:38,010
this is a the kind of clts you have this

00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,810
a global clts it represent the

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,240
choreography that you saw in the payment

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,310
to before and this is the state machine

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,670
with the states and the transition

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,860
between the states

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,020
and a transition here is an a bird if

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,600
you receive a specific message so you

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,080
move from state to state and only form

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,830
allows state to another allowed state

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:03,160
then you project this so you obtain a

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,230
specific clts for each participant we

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,810
are in the airport use case we will have

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:14,460
a CLTS for the airport for the ATC and

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:17,740
for the amenity providers so top step

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,890
obtaining the coordination delegates and

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,500
I represented them here as a little

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,320
policeman because in fact this city's

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,300
what they do is they replace the

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,340
orchestrator the single orchestrator

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,060
that will be used that will be used

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,130
sorry in a orchestration based logic but

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,830
then we move to this choreography better

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,230
object and we dispatch the coordination

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,880
object between all the cities these are

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,010
the green boxes that you have between

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,800
each participant and for each

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:52,330
communication a specific CD coordination

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,730
delegate will allow a specific message

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,920
only if it is allowed as a specific

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,690
point in time so they control all the

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:06,700
execution and the exchange of messages

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:08,830
between services so concluding correos

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,400
enables us to have choreography

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,350
symmetric SLA this state we sustain the

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,180
centralized service choreographies the

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,730
centralized because you have no single

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,040
point of failure of control you remove

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,860
the orchestrator we support future

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,470
internet and large-scale we focus on

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,690
internet of services and things I didn't

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,140
talk about things today but they are

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,770
used a lot in the girls for sensors

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,510
actuators and as I said just before this

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,850
coordination delegates that are the

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,460
center of the core of coils are like

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,980
policemen and they answer the correct

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,260
execution of enactment of the

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,710
choreography following its coordination

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:54,610
logic that is formally defined in this

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,810
clts language so one third of the

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,550
project is still to be completed

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,279
and the end of the project is done

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,840
scheduled for the end of 2013 I hope

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,290
that next time I will be able to show

00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,630
you a nice guys and interfaces of the

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,390
tooling that is in the eye dr e and of

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,970
course since we are a tad value to hear

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,100
al correo specific development will be

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,970
released as open source software on a

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,339
base de like listens so this is the

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,830
website and you can go check out to have

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:30,700
more details on cows and also retrieve

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,700
