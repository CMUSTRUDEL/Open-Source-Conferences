	Helping ISVs and OW2 projects to onboard software to cloud - Alban Richard, Usharesoft
Abstract : This session discusses how ISVs and OW2 projects can easily onboard their software to cloud.  IT cloud app stores and marketplaces are now beginning to emerge. In the near future, such stores will be a new way for ISVs to accelerate their business and grow user adoption. However today, preparing applications for cloud app stores often requires lengthy, manual processes to build software images. Often, these processes are not agile enough to easily support multiple hypervisors and clouds, or quickly implement software updates. ISVs need tools that model software images as templates, as well as automating the assembly and maintenance processes. By using a model-driven approach, ISVs can easily support multiple hypervisors as well as hybrid cloud environments.
UShareSoft's UForge image template management platform enables ISVs and OW2 projects to package applications as customizable software templates or ready-to-run VMs available for instant publish to any cloud infrastructure or market place. The session will cover how OW2 projects can benefit from UForge as well as providing a short demonstration of the UForge factory and app store in action.
