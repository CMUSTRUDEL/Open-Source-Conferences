Description: 
	OpenCloudware: the Cloud application lifecycle management platform - Alexandre Lefebvre, Orange & OW2 and  Thomas Debru, UShareSoft
Abstract : The OpenCloudware collaborative R&D project aims at building an open software engineering platform, for the collaborative development of distributed applications to be deployed on multiple Cloud infrastructures. It will be available through a self-service portal. We target virtualized multi-tier applications such as JavaEE - OSGi. The results of OpenCloudware contain a set of software components to manage the lifecycle of such applications, from modelling (Think), developing and building images (Build), to a multi-IaaS compliant PaaS platform (Run) for their deployment, orchestration, performance testing, self-management (elasticity, green IT optimisation) and provisioning. Applications can be deployed potentially on multiple IaaS (supporting either one IaaS at a time, or hybrid scenarios). The results of the project are gradually made available as open source components through the OW2 Open Source Cloudware initiative. The OpenCloudware project is coordinated by France Telecom Orange, funded by the french Fonds National pour la Société Numérique (FSN) and endorsed by competitiveness clusters Minalogic, Systematic and SCS. The project runs between January 2012 and December 2014.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
so it's a it's a nice transition from

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,719
what be honest just presented because

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,490
the work that Donna has as presented we

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,080
hope to be able to integrate in open

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,289
cloud where so i will present you now

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,210
the open cloud where a collaborative

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,220
research project we're together with

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,580
Toma who will do the end of the

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,039
presentation and so it's a it's it's

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,010
it's a project about managing the

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,619
application lifecycle of complex

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,190
applications from the building of the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,760
application to its provisioning and its

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,530
operation so what is it it's a

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,230
collaborative research project it's a

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,090
fairly large project involving 18

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,270
partners and it's funded by the French

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:54,090
French authorities and so the whole idea

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,370
is to take a detective account

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,559
distributed enterprise application and

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,710
to be able to deploy them on any cloud

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,409
so what we are what we aim at with this

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,150
project is to be able to model the

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,460
distributed application which can be

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,369
made of several virtual machines to

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,229
assemble them build them deploy them and

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,180
operate them so that's the platform as a

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,960
service layer if you like on multiple

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,890
infrastructure so being

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,110
infrastructure-as-a-service agnostic

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,560
it's a three-year project that started

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,780
in January so we've been through a lot

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,250
of design phases and we're starting the

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,740
implementation now and so the partners

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,829
of the project which are displayed here

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,799
are a number of large corporations will

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,990
not go through them in details a lot of

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,899
SMEs of some of them being more or less

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,909
large actually and quite a few academic

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,750
partners will go back to that later and

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,720
also or w2 as the dissemination partner

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,930
for for open source so the project's led

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,390
by France Telecom orange and the best

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,210
way is to explain the project briefly

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,909
with a use case so to give you a better

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,300
idea what we're aiming to do so the idea

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,100
is take any of your favor

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,010
java application three-tier or an apache

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,410
PHP mysql architect architecture

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,870
application so the user will want to

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,970
deploy that on the cloud so what does it

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,450
want to do well the first thing is has

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,180
to login into the open cloud web portal

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,700
so we are as part of the project we are

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,230
working on what the portal is we're

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,050
working a lot on the different roles

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,230
that different users may have as part of

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,420
the different roles of the users for us

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,120
a user would be typically a developer

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,340
project manager and we also have to take

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,790
into account the role of the company if

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,620
the company has accounts on the various

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,020
infrastructure-as-a-service clouds on

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,580
the data centers so there's a work on

00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,060
role-based access control that's being

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,370
done there so once the once the user is

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,430
logged in what the user wants to do is

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:09,200
to build its virtual applications so for

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,420
doing this we are developing a V app

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,510
model which is based on an extension on

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,070
ovf to be able to describe the different

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,500
nodes of the virtual application the

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,590
relationship with the nodes also this

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,930
the service level agreement that the

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,730
user would like to express and these

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:31,580
produces this produce ISM an XML file

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,580
which represents the model also we will

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,570
offer to the user number of templates so

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,920
if the some other templates will be

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:43,580
pre-prepared and pre used so typical

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,959
java ee lamp applications but also the

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,700
user will be able to build his own

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,440
templates and that will make like a

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,810
template gallery which can be offered to

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,260
users to build applications and that's

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:57,040
an extensible gallery as well so once we

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,900
have the model then we go to deployment

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,380
so too for doing this we go through a

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,030
lot of different phases we start with of

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,350
course building the application so

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,510
that's from the developer's point of

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,060
view we will plug in with Jen typical

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:15,050
build building tools then we have to

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,220
generate a service plan which is the the

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,079
different

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,370
ms that will the representation of the

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,760
different beams I will need to be

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,590
created then we'll go to the

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,570
orchestration layer the pass

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,710
orchestration layer for deployment which

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,960
will itself address to the management of

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,140
the various infrastructure as a service

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,970
components to be able to provision the

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,390
VMS underneath in the appropriate

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,570
infrastructure as a service so once they

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,580
see once this is done once this is

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,260
deployed so typically as as Jimi would

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,290
say you've deployed your application and

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,020
you want to know how much it costs so we

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,950
have a we will have a billing component

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,010
that will be able to tell the user your

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,630
VMS as they are running now empty this

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,060
is how much they cost now so this is

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,920
this gives a vague estimate for the user

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,200
of how much the application will cost at

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,060
runtime but the user really wants to

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,360
know how much it will cost when he does

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,850
real load on the system so we have a

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,320
with the end integration of cliff which

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,520
will be the topic of the next

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,680
presentation just after this one I think

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,350
we will the user can express some load

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,540
so typically i have so many requests per

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,060
second eighty percent are read request

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,550
twenty percent are write request so the

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,440
user uses cliff which is a load

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,210
injection platform to define its load

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,130
profile then the load is injected and

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,080
after the tests here you're running for

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,330
an hour the user can see how much it

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,870
costs typically for an hour given its

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,260
estimate loads that he can plan in the

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,750
future so this is very good also while

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,850
the performance test is running the user

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,440
can see that the original instance of

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,200
the application which had two nodes in

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,440
the middle tier happen to now have a

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,240
third node so that's also another item

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,260
that we're working on which is the self

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,080
management of the platform and so given

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,330
the SLA s for example any of the middle

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,820
tier node may not go beyond eighty

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,740
percent of the CPU then if there is a

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,260
threshold that if this threshold has

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,240
been going over then the platform will

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,400
instantiate a new vm

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
and create a third node so through

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,199
through the monitoring the user can see

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,630
that indeed open cloud where answer his

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,650
promises and has created a new node in

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:41,330
order to cope with the load when the

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,960
testing is done the user wants to go to

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:48,500
production so what he does is now he

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,840
will it will give a public IP which is

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,550
maybe closer to where its customers are

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,580
so imagine the customers are in Brazil

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,880
and put some real data in the database

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,979
and do a bit more maybe a bit more of

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,300
testing or just put the the platform

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,300
into production and then what you can

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,830
see is that because the customers are

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,960
close to our in Brazil it will see that

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,270
the infrastructure as a service will

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,180
actually migrate some of the virtual

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,460
machines to data center which is closer

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,069
to the customer in order in this use

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,490
case to reduce the latency so that's

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,560
another another sl8 as being into

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,090
account we begin taken into account at

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,990
the multi yes layer at this time and

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,550
finally there will planning an a

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,530
monitoring console which will probably

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,509
be based on the work that Danice just

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,909
presented to be able to aggregate all

00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,370
these data and all the monitoring data

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:48,710
that we gather can be presented to the

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,870
user of the end user the platform

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,969
manager but also we need all these

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,419
monitoring data to be able to run all

00:07:52,969 --> 00:08:00,050
the self-management layer that I

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:02,000
mentioned in order to be able to to

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,830
check the SLA s we need data so that's

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,349
why the monitoring is very important and

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,840
this is also why we need monitoring

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:12,469
that's being able to get data from

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,889
various sources right so that's the

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,349
Lester use case so in this slide sort of

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:21,770
summarizes the scope of the project so

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:25,650
the whole idea is is to be able to to

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,430
start with to start with a nap

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:32,310
education that's being designed then to

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,950
be able to implement the implement the

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,349
code then once the users done that we'll

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,450
go through the building phase all the

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,820
unit testing continuous integration and

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,919
with the use of templates we produce the

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,920
images which are then packaged and

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,950
deployed and operated with all the self

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,950
management issues on multi yes and this

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,380
is a cycle in the sense that support of

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,940
the different versions of the

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,959
applications will also be taken into

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,690
account now so in terms of the tongue of

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,300
a target what we are aiming at is a set

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,690
of components to build an open platform

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,580
end-to-end platform as a service and

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,170
application management tool so it's got

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,420
to be a platform but it's made of

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,330
components and we really want it to be

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,160
extensible and customizable so in the

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,860
scope of the project we will deal with a

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,459
number of middleware components that we

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,470
want to be elastic but we really want

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,709
also that if tomorrow you arrive with

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,959
your sugar crm your whichever middleware

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:37,380
name it to be able to take it into

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,959
account in the in the platform and make

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,490
it so that it will be able to be elastic

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:48,150
and deployed as well and as I said we're

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:52,770
also aiming at a number of possible any

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:56,880
infrastructure as a service component so

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,529
in terms of scope we're reusing a number

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,360
of audible and extending a number of

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,810
portability project which I'll show on

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,730
the next slide this open cloud where is

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,060
a direct output of the open source cloud

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,160
where initiative or w-2 we have strong

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,940
relationship with compatible one that

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,370
Jamie presented earlier on and so we're

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,730
working at the moment on especially on

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,889
SLA because that's where we're working

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,869
on

00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:27,249
at the moment how to integrate the SLA

00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:30,170
novi you know in our ovf plus plus model

00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:31,549
even though compatible one and open

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,290
cloud where I've chosen different

00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:36,230
standards because compatible ones based

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,790
on occi and open cloud where is based on

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,160
the MTF see me were trying to make

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,410
bridges between the two and another

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,449
common point is the platform as a

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,049
service component of compatible one

00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:49,549
which is jPAS is being extended in open

00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,649
cloud way through the same people who

00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:53,959
actually made a pass so that is not a

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,389
link there and there's a few partners

00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,949
that are in both projects as well we

00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:03,199
reuse a number of other open source

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:06,309
projects and any any cloud in yes so at

00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:08,480
the moment we're we're targeting both

00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,879
proprietary ones so we're experimenting

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,299
with VMware we're starting to a

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:17,749
publisher and where we've started with

00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,699
OpenStack but we will depending on the

00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:21,379
resources will can do more and if

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:23,359
because it will be open source if other

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,540
people want to contribute on other yes

00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:29,899
it's possible so in terms of software as

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:34,519
I said we will extend a number of owt

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:37,779
software around java ee including joram

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,419
that you presented this morning sir also

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:44,119
just mean and the Patels ESB which will

00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,889
be the topic of presentations today the

00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,049
component about security and role-based

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:51,799
access control is called all fours and

00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:56,899
it's mainly edited by dallas today cliff

00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:59,480
& Sirocco will be presented a later on

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,519
as well as proactive entropy will also

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,279
be presented which is about vm placement

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,519
and energy consumption in terms of

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,489
portal we're using XO and we use other

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,139
open-source software and we also use for

00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:15,319
the building building the images you

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:18,289
forge which is a provided bar by our

00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:22,309
partner in the project you share soft so

00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:24,769
I'll hand over to tomah for the next

00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:28,069
node you've got three minutes ok thank

00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:32,299
you ok just in fact the latest slides

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:33,699
are just a recap of what I like said in

00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:38,319
terms of challenges

00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:40,540
to build such a platform let's say two 2

00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:44,410
and 0 the full life cycle of a

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,949
multi-tier software solution you you

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,959
need there are a lot of datas to be to

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,019
be added to such platform so you need a

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,169
strong model in place so there is a huge

00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:59,859
effort inside this project based on this

00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:03,429
topic then of course cloud computing is

00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:05,799
all about automation so in fact it self

00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,999
service and automation you can imagine

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,889
the challenges that that are inside this

00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,739
project to automate everything that we

00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,290
want to propose of course bling will TT

00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:21,549
of the apps is is a really great thing

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:24,929
it's not so easy so as alex has

00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:27,989
explained we have tried to extend ovf

00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:32,669
standard in order to cover our our needs

00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:36,879
then of course one topic that is really

00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:39,789
really interesting is this autonomic

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,850
management that will up the application

00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:47,309
to to have alleged elasticity so that

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:50,789
you can in fact under prediction system

00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:56,039
and all this management okay two minutes

00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:59,139
then 11 good good thing is this

00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:02,199
agnostics it e in terms of gas platform

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:05,339
that's one of the key element of the of

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,570
this project is to be able to address

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:11,960
private public cloud

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,480
within the same manner of course we do

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,910
have some security aspect that are

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,050
covered by this project around identity

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,660
access and on how to protect data from

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,090
the application yes of course we don't

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,880
want to reinvent the world and that's

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,860
why we are trying and we have tried

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,340
since the beginning of the project to

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,030
discuss with other research projects

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,250
such as a compatible one in order to to

00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,370
leverage what they have done so far and

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,160
to try to go probably further because we

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:52,310
do have three years to do that in order

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,650
to to complete our our mission okay then

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,770
that's the conclusion where we are now

00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:01,250
we have discussed a lot we have we have

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,960
add six months of a design phase but we

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,450
do have some some Greeks already there

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,810
so the green part are the one that we

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:11,090
have started to implement it's a huge

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:14,030
project there are many partners but we

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:18,140
are trying to to cope with this and to

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:21,170
have some strong commitments on our

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,120
deliveries so I don't want to enter too

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,430
much detail on this I think we're

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,370
running out of time and thank you for

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,190
your time and of course Alex and myself

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,730
are available to discuss if you have any

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:39,040
question not probably now but later on

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,040
