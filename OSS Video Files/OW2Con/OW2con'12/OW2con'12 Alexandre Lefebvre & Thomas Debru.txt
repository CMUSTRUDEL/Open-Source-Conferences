Description: 
	OpenCloudware: the Cloud application lifecycle management platform - Alexandre Lefebvre, Orange & OW2 and  Thomas Debru, UShareSoft
Abstract : The OpenCloudware collaborative R&D project aims at building an open software engineering platform, for the collaborative development of distributed applications to be deployed on multiple Cloud infrastructures. It will be available through a self-service portal. We target virtualized multi-tier applications such as JavaEE - OSGi. The results of OpenCloudware contain a set of software components to manage the lifecycle of such applications, from modelling (Think), developing and building images (Build), to a multi-IaaS compliant PaaS platform (Run) for their deployment, orchestration, performance testing, self-management (elasticity, green IT optimisation) and provisioning. Applications can be deployed potentially on multiple IaaS (supporting either one IaaS at a time, or hybrid scenarios). The results of the project are gradually made available as open source components through the OW2 Open Source Cloudware initiative. The OpenCloudware project is coordinated by France Telecom Orange, funded by the french Fonds National pour la Société Numérique (FSN) and endorsed by competitiveness clusters Minalogic, Systematic and SCS. The project runs between January 2012 and December 2014.
