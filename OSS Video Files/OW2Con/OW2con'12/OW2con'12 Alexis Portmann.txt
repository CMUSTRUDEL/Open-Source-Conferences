about the agenda so we will see first a

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,880
little bit about Bonita and the

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,400
milestones of the key milestones of our

business model so Bonita soft is the

first open source VPN provider it means

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,940
like in terms of download we have 1.5

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,469
millions of the non-league for our

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:46,079
solution we have 25,000 community member

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,850
who are very active in developing new

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:55,379
features for our solution we have more

00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:00,000
than 450 customers hundred of employee

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,579
and about 60 technologic partner who are

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,100
both integrators or people that

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:10,320
integrate our software in dem solution

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,140
so and we have yes as it aside some

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,790
awards and we are very proud of getting

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,280
the awards yesterday so yeah the

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,619
gardener tell us that we are the only

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,829
open source that meets at the Gartner

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:32,850
definition of BPM bpms so about the

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,360
milestones of paleta in 2001 the project

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:43,770
Bonita was founded it was a first in

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:46,950
Cuba in a bull bull in granola with some

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:52,310
people of the engineers cooler in real

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:57,719
and in 2008 Bonita for is released and

00:01:52,310 --> 00:02:02,250
real start was in 2009 when we founded

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,430
Bonita and the five

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,210
the 5 version was launched it in 2001

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,340
and at the same time we created offices

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:18,420
in Paris and San Francisco so yeah in

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:23,000
2012 we have signed our force 400

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:28,620
customers so about the funding of bonita

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,780
we have known 12.5 million 222 to

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,420
continue the growth and the worldwide

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,850
growth the first one the first one was

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:42,720
in 2009 and we raised a 2.9 millions 2.5

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:47,489
sorry then to millions in 2010 and eight

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,400
million in 2011 we are still trying to

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:55,410
raise a more in order to to to

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,070
sustainable grooves so about the various

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,459
customer we have I will probably not

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:06,170
details each one of them but the idea is

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:09,920
that because we focused on the processes

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:16,110
we can reach any kind of organization

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:20,790
Thanks it has typical of a minimum size

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,390
in order to process its activities so

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,890
what we do delivering business

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,870
efficiency by turning process into

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,340
application we observed that the

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,090
traditional way of developing

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,769
applications inside organization was

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,360
usually to make some cases and then

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,920
specification and then civica figuration

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,910
you make code and then you have the

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,060
application so we observed that it takes

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,370
a long time to do it and especially

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,860
there was a lack of communication

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,860
between technical people and and and and

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,100
business people so the idea was to give

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,040
to the business people the ability to

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,040
make them own application so the idea is

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,260
that when you model eyes the process you

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,880
are making without knowing it you are

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,170
making a code that we

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,510
produce an application so you have a

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:22,290
graphical studio in that graphical

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,660
studio you are making the the process so

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,700
you design it and then you link it with

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,660
the various application of your system

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,720
and then you can have your application

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,630
so the benefits as it did say you have

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,530
improved color collaboration you have a

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,450
fast IT alignment to to business easy to

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,890
update and to maintain and you have

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:49,140
immediate return on investment the idea

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,010
of the return on investment is it is

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,960
quite simple because you have you can

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,360
make like with one license you can make

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,180
it like a thousand applications so the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:06,030
idea is how many days do i use to make

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,360
an application I know traditional away

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,130
and how much do it takes to make it with

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:18,480
benita versus the number of application

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,990
so you have here the studio we use the

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,290
VPN notation so we try to do it as

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:29,370
simple as possible so people that are

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,230
not technical can use it there is indeed

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,510
a technical side which is about the

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:39,810
connectors that will help you to get

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,760
specific applications on your system it

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,970
means like balita will be able to

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:51,440
execute some features in other systems

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:56,370
and so the ID was to make our solution

00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:01,380
the most efficient by making a lot of

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,920
connectors to help it to be integrated

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,230
in any kind of systems so you have like

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,800
we can see you have a say p you have

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,560
sharepoint XO everything is the

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,500
environment of bonita soft and the idea

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,220
is that anytime bonitas have needed it

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,200
can execute application on execute

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,950
features on other applications

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,290
so once you have your process made in

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,350
the studio connected with the other

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:37,370
application you can run your process so

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:40,550
really process it means that you you you

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,490
make work the application so you can

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,390
follow the application on a Bonita user

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:50,990
experience which is now it could be

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,330
compared with a mailbox where some

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,300
people of the process will have all the

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,760
task they have to do so they can access

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,590
the task directly in the Bonita user

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,980
experience and you also have a

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:10,610
standalone application where people can

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,610
directly use the application and those

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:18,230
standalone application you can put them

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,410
in your like your website or everything

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:27,160
like that directly because we propose

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:31,040
some graphical tools to respect the

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:35,990
respect the design of your own

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:41,830
applications so about the architecture

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:45,650
so you see that we have three main thing

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,460
the enzyme of bonita soft the Bonita

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,440
studio and the Bonita user experience

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,290
the idea is that the engine of bonita

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,810
soft is see is a full open source

00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:01,060
version so you can use it whenever you

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:04,280
want without killing any feet bonita and

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:09,530
bonita a studio and the user experience

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,290
are part of our commercial offer and we

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:19,520
have different different pack and each

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:22,220
pockets get more features so as I said

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,580
the business model you have the Bonita

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:29,150
sins open solution with the engine and

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,700
some some tools of the user experience

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,680
and you also have the subscription tax

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,380
so the substitution pack has many

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,640
features

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,870
and the idea is that when you use the

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,229
subscription pack you don't have to

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:47,910
develop yourself so it's like it getting

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:51,390
it can helps your project to to grow

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,870
faster so you have teamwork which have

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:58,410
focused on collaboration you have

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:01,590
efficiency who is more driven like for

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,410
instance we give you some we give you

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,990
some templates and process templates so

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,750
it's like small application you directly

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,930
download it in your in your bonita and

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,110
it's already usable you just have to

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,260
make some margin changes for using it

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,590
and you have then performance which is a

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,040
mission-critical performance especially

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:30,780
focus on the monitoring of the processes

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,010
so it's a from a quality side to see how

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:38,430
the process execute how time what are

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,070
the mistakes and everything so yeah if

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,620
you want to start you can use the Bonita

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,350
open solution but if you want your

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,950
project to grow faster and to go faster

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:54,770
you may use the Bonita a subscription

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,770
back thank you very much

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,710
good morning everybody thank you or the

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,830
video to to give me the opportunity to
