welcome everybody I'm glad to have you

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,349
hold this morning attending this

00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:14,340
roundtable about the place of open

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,230
source in the virtual datacenter so I

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:22,050
will call the panelist to join us if you

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,430
wish Hallia TI is of course already

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:31,199
there so Nicola way is now joining us he

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:35,820
is the founder and CEO of Celeste which

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:40,340
owns the famous Marilyn data center in

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,530
eastern part of Paris then join us

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,579
joining us amake bhule the CEO of

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,280
non-stop systems which is a system

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,050
integrator we could say he will tell us

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,410
exactly about the company honey alimi

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,460
welcome you are the lead cloud computing

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,210
architect from bull and at least Danny

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,439
Danny come L will join us good morning

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,260
Denise Denise as you know is the CEO of

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,890
active oil and the one of the award

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,310
winner of yesterday's so welcome

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,850
everybody yesterday we spoke about three

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,080
challenges main challenges for open

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,119
source that was standouts innovation and

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,320
sovereignty today one more challenge is

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,229
to define the virtual data center or is

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,040
it the next generation data center will

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,570
see that together will over all of us

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,930
read and learn about villains about VDS

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:51,420
virtual disk virtual CPU VMs what

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,750
exactly is a virtual data center is it

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,090
only a memory is treasure problem or

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,640
issue how important is it for our

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,869
business and IT services those are few

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,330
questions that will see together and to

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,000
some of this issue I'm glad to introduce

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:17,110
a Leah Thiele gammon you

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,680
poke the recently about countries under

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:24,010
pressure on the tension like Lebanon so

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,090
having a virtual data center what would

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:31,690
could be an opportunity for your country

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,870
in the sports a scope of work of the

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,580
government portal we have also an

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:43,720
e-government data center version one in

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,650
order to have this first data center the

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,480
architecture is based on virtualization

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,840
complete virtualization in order to

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,290
extend for other data centers and

00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,480
disaster recovery and and so on we need

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:05,590
an extensible architecture for hardware

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:10,300
for and for software the virtualization

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:13,060
is very important because we start with

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,489
about 30 services but we are planned to

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,459
have 500 e services then the

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,880
virtualization the virial data center is

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,670
very important to have a scalable that

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,299
the center to be to integrate the Future

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,820
II services and for this for this

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:35,910
project so scalability issue and also

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:41,350
disaster recovery plan and Nicola yes

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:44,230
this just meet up beside I question are

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,239
you ready to have your data in outside

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:53,980
of Lebanon or do you choose to have you

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:57,220
that are only in Lebanon for the moment

00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:01,959
it will be in Lebanon the decision to

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,950
have a governmental that outside the

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,430
country I think should be decided by the

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:13,450
Council of Ministers it's an important

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:17,680
decision and

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:20,350
we start thinking about how we can have

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,910
a private cloud for the Lebanese

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:28,240
government but we have maybe a cultural

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:31,030
problem you know for the moment

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,220
semantics administration say if I don't

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,760
have my own server in my own premises

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,450
and by my data and I own several then

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,460
it's not it doesn't belong to to me then

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,930
we have also to make some awareness

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:50,770
about security could be confidentiality

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:55,300
integrity of information could be

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:59,760
decentralized this is also very very

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:04,419
important at least in imagined countries

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:08,020
with the ICT level is not so advanced as

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:11,200
maybe the other other countries Nicola

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,510
the importance of for virtual for data

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,150
center physical data center may be

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,090
having several customers of course with

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,479
sharing infrastructure sharing also

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,720
services so is the the notion of class

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,960
of services important now yes of course

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,850
we already know what is data center its

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,560
a brick-and-mortar data center we we

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:40,090
have we can see this data center and you

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,270
have several key aspects with security

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,630
access to the data center itself and now

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,650
we are talking about virtual data center

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:56,110
which I mean is mainly the contrary of

00:05:50,650 --> 00:06:00,760
brick-and-mortar data center so the the

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:03,030
point is to present that offer to

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:08,250
customers either public customers either

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:13,360
private ones and two and they accept to

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:17,410
put that data in a place that they don't

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,620
know basically so you must have levels

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,970
of service or maybe class of service or

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,370
type of

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,740
maybe eras regions in your virtual data

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,530
centers where you can ground you where

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,330
the data is and this type of questions

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,610
are very important for governments

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,370
because for example with the newest

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,360
project we try to make an offer for

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,340
public services in France but we are

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,410
sure that the administration wants to

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,930
know where the data is so this kind of

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,030
aspects are very strong in the virtual

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,490
data center project yes speaking of a

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,400
hash mark you will probably help us

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,620
understand what is exactly what inside

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,590
the virtual data center in fact is it to

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,200
get an order of utilization layer mark

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,180
over the existing one how do you see it

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,250
from your point of view maybe I can

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,690
introduce new age in in a few words I'm

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:23,070
sure so new edge is a consortium of

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:26,640
sevens more companies which have decided

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,910
to establish a collaborative way to make

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,960
research and we are followed and

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:37,740
supported by the public research by the

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:43,320
two teams of the ellip lipsticks at

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:47,610
about horizon the main goal of niraj was

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:51,900
to adapt the cloud concept to the French

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:56,720
reality of small and medium size yeah

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,720
exactly we have more than three million

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:06,540
very small companies and okay cloud is a

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:10,410
major opportunity for for those

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:16,160
companies but it's major risk to because

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:21,660
as Nikola said Kemp that as goes

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:27,910
everywhere as if so they can you you

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:31,250
have you have the

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:35,150
the problem is okay oh you consider all

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,570
realities are public and no way all you

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:41,839
consider then you consider your debtors

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:45,050
are a part of the value of your company

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:50,750
if you aren't is and we have based our

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:55,220
really strategy on this so if we want to

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,500
allow small companies to know where that

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:03,880
as air as they don't have the technical

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:07,040
level to follow them we must reconsider

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:12,080
the data center as a global virtual data

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:15,260
center and localize that has closed to

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:21,589
the user sisters as possible as close as

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:24,320
possible then he says a reaction yes I

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:27,110
wanted to get back to your question but

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,589
is VDC visual data center a new

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,959
virtualization layer to my understanding

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,890
i think they are twofold to aspect into

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,870
a V DC so the first one which is a

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,209
delegation of administrative right and

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,570
the second one is more technical which

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:47,930
is a problem of allocation of resources

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,050
so what people do with VDC and this is

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,020
the case in vmware which vector V cloud

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,180
and also in OpenStack with a sim

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,720
something called Project which can

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,589
delegate right that you will set apart a

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,339
set of resources virtual machine

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:09,500
networking memory so range and you will

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,510
decide that this is a virtual data

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,270
sometimes the most important aspect

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,970
about that is a fact that you delegate

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,150
the administration right to somebody

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,300
else so you you turn something which is

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,800
a big data center with virtualization

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,560
into something that you cut in please

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,900
and you give to somebody else into your

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,029
organization to a destroyed so it can

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,870
see of course in your administration but

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:37,699
it can also be to some customer in the

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,109
case of hosting

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:43,579
so this is the first aspect maybe we

00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,790
move on to the second one because my

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:48,169
company's population or if it is the

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,540
automation and the dynamic aspect of

00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:54,290
allocation maybe later yes Thank You

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:58,309
Denise for this clarification for at you

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:01,189
open your opinion does VDC only requires

00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:04,970
one physical data center or is it a mesh

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:08,629
network of data centers for instance I

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:12,470
know one of your customer and Celeste is

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:17,689
working on the else care industry and as

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:20,569
two separate sites yes I i think if we

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:23,109
imagine that virtual data center is only

00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:30,499
one data center with virtualization

00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:32,540
maybe it's not I think it's just part of

00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:36,679
the image reduces the interest of the

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,879
project I think the if you can do

00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:43,789
virtualization in the data center then

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:47,619
you must use several other centers to to

00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:50,809
have resonance to have maybe you can

00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:53,809
have several climates when it's called

00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:57,259
you use free cooling when it's hot you

00:11:53,809 --> 00:12:00,980
don't are when there is a disaster you

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:03,709
can recover so I mean one of the

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,970
benefits of virtualization ability is to

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:10,339
be in several places so having a full

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:14,839
convo redundancy of everything on both

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,929
place or on several data centers and you

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,299
that then comes the question of

00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:22,850
interoperability and you talk about a

00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:25,039
one of our customers which is a capsule

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,999
which is a medical company in the US and

00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:33,169
in France in Europe and they need to to

00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,880
address they provide tools for four

00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:40,730
hospitals me

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:44,120
you can put the passion data on the

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,770
cloud for for the hospitals so they need

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,580
to be in several data centers and

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:52,490
several places in several continents and

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,560
they choose the chose our letters and

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,730
amar in data center but other ones in

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:02,240
the US to be resonant and we had to be

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,920
compatible each other so I think maybe

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,590
we created a virtual data center between

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:12,650
them and as we we didn't know them

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,200
before but we we could build a virtual

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,020
data center between the edge from

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,700
different partners it's interesting to

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,740
see what was the requirements to build

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,270
this virtual datacenter with new

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,980
partners basically the requirement where

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:32,800
to to have a strong network that was a

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,080
refurbishment probably about tix

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,900
friction technologies cuz the a sensible

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,910
so actually it was not gripped it was

00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:46,730
just private we had a only one layer to

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,540
network no ethernet network so it's to

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,380
talk private and so it's not encrypted

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,980
for for this data and that was a first

00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:03,590
requirement and the second man was i

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:07,790
mean the the SLA of the data center and

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:10,520
the type of service we provide so also

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:16,970
monitoring system to provide a joint

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:19,940
system motoring I mean in case of crash

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,180
the type to repair and this cat type of

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,930
things I nearly mean we saw that there

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:31,640
are multiple usage already for VDC is it

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:34,360
one point to to to to get I IaaS but

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,010
also platform-as-a-service on the same

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,910
platform is it one of the goal of the

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,160
virtual datacenter yes but

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,010
if it if you take a step back and look

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,310
at the technological aspect if we speak

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:52,330
about virtual dead center we have a

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:55,840
missing piece right now because a data

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,710
center is composed of servers storage

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:03,030
but also network the transition in term

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,620
of service has more than 10 years

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:10,030
internal storage started to virtualize

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,550
maybe five or six years ago but so far

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,460
we don't have a real virtualization in

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,830
terms of networking we spoke to the

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,900
villain and VPNs but that it's not

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,050
individual that it's not really alert

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,700
ization because that decision means that

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,850
you have an abstraction in terms of

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,490
addressing exchange League know with SDM

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,170
yeah the next wave is the

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,390
software-defined networking that we

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,030
allow us to have a real and actual data

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:41,230
center actual virtual dysentery speak

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:43,330
about a mesh of small that Center we

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,730
cannot move your work route between the

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:49,950
different that center because you have

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:54,490
an IP addressing that is monolithic and

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:57,850
inflexible and I think that we will have

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:01,810
an actual virtual dead center wants the

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:04,600
software-defined networking attain a

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:07,720
certain level of maturity yes and when

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,270
do you expect this maturity to software

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,110
software defined networking started just

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,770
maybe two three years ago it's coming

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,020
it's the next wave of technological

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:24,750
component and I think in terms of

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:28,090
maturity mate maybe next year or maybe

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,950
18 month so to have something thanks to

00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,600
many we understand that it's an emerging

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:36,010
virtual data center that we are facing

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,110
at the moment and what would be the main

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,470
benefits for corporations and for

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,990
administration is it the actual recovery

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,960
plans that will evolve to continuity to

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,850
a global

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:54,790
application and workload movement with

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,660
maybe a strategic more strategic

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:02,680
application that needs those continuity

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:05,800
what do you think i have just a question

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,470
before if you can sure what kind of

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:14,130
technologies do you do you expect to

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:17,709
emerge in a software-defined networking

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:20,950
today we have a foundation which is open

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:23,260
flow software-defined networking it's

00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,440
not equal to open through it I think

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,700
that open flow will be the right

00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,830
foundation to build an SDN offering

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:40,210
thank you yeah we see a lot of things

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:41,770
coming I think it will be really the

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,550
next challenge that there is another

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:50,560
change was coming just in this few in a

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:54,570
few which is energy its energy

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,680
administration virtual is it we r ji

00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:00,070
actually walking in the virtualization

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,630
of all the power main issues in data

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:09,400
center will be for definite of lee and

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:12,100
so I what worries you sorry to to move

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,100
the workloads where the energies are to

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,810
the lower exactly exactly and in a and

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,110
this is the reason why all the actors

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:23,020
are running today to trivia tour is also

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,970
data centers in order to manage two

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,070
different problems of rusty is a

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:33,910
disaster we seen in u.s. than when they

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,040
are poor is use whatever the situation

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:40,000
as a call so the caves the situation is

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,540
its global nightmare for for the cloud

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,540
users and

00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:50,460
basically what we would need to be able

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:53,039
to do is to move full data center very

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,649
very fast and this is the goal of New

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,529
Age skill of New Age basically one of

00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:01,919
the cold New Age else in to be able to

00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:06,779
consider a data center as ok we can lose

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:10,460
the data center right Dennis maybe we

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:13,529
have another plans for virtual

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,409
datacenter not only virtualizing the

00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:20,450
central sites but also using all the

00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:22,859
pieces in the company's offices yeah so

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,470
well this is something well known and

00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:28,759
that came with grid computing but the

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,909
pressure is now being so strong and

00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:36,539
Heidi cast an energy consumption that is

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:40,619
really becoming a useful solution now

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:43,409
for four companies and this bring a

00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:46,649
platform which is to be dynamic and with

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:51,090
at a very nervous resources and just to

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:55,169
get back to to to VDC well if you think

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:58,049
about it virtualization is about global

00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:00,389
management of data center plus isolation

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,399
right I mean a strong aspect of

00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:05,399
virtualization is that you can share

00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:06,899
critical resources without the problem

00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:09,509
of having a different application

00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:13,349
running on the same machine so isolation

00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:16,470
is something very strong in a cloud

00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:19,200
computing in general and now what we are

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,679
talking about with VDC is the fact that

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,919
you are turning off a global allocation

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,169
of data center into something which is

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,440
statically allocated to to somebody

00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,619
which does not seem very right in a

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,559
sense that you are making yourself in a

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,659
position where you turn to static

00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,540
allocation to to some people which is in

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:44,580
some way good because you

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,690
down administrative right to somebody

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,430
else but you are not a little bit of

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,890
dynamic city and if we remember

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,470
everything that was said yesterday

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,390
elasticity is a key point of application

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,060
so if you have a video VDC you might be

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,070
a little bit tight into your VDC so I

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,230
think that we will get very strongly

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,960
into the problem of dynamic allocation

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:10,800
of associate and to have a way to

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,710
dynamically allocate resources to people

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,880
and I will take the another surgery of a

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:21,540
line company when you do global asset

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,940
management the best way to do yell yell

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,990
management to optimize the way you use

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,720
the money you get is to actually sell

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:33,960
more seeds that you have in a plane all

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,540
right and you you do overbooking of your

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,730
sauces and then you manage that with

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,310
somebody that we know in 80 which is

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,050
quality of service if you have our next

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,900
month's if ticket you will never be

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,700
denied to get on the seat if you have a

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,590
cheap ticket you might be you I get off

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,010
the plane so this is quality of service

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,980
for global management of data center in

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,170
cloud computing Thank You Dennis we see

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,660
a little bit more precisely what there

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,970
is behind this video now speaking about

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,490
open source technologies I think it's

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,710
interesting to to see what are the open

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:11,160
source bricks that could fit into this

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,740
new design of virtual datacenters what

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,710
do we need exactly is it a distributed

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,300
file system do we need more Club brokers

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,180
like we're so compatible one yesterday

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,160
or more monitoring system what is the

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,050
the missing pieces view you mentioned

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:31,830
SDM do you know about for instance

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:35,470
openflow open software initiatives maybe

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,450
just two yes Elliot L go I

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,780
like to mention maybe in dimension which

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:46,130
is very important for us to do this the

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:49,370
hosting of data and information maybe

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:53,720
especially a public for public data

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:57,640
public information the data should be

00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:01,960
secured and should be completely

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:06,320
confidential how it is guaranteed for

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,780
with the virtual data center even if

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,250
there is different locations and

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:15,470
different which it should be I think at

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,660
a black box I have some information

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,790
which are stored and hosted and a

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:24,320
virtual data center somewhere this is a

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:27,080
demented very important dimension at

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:32,860
least for the public administration I

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:37,400
think for also private companies and I

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,560
is there some experience about that

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,750
coming from country and stored in

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,730
another country it's important for me to

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,100
know also if you have some information

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:52,820
about that outside chilling outside the

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:54,920
country yes it's maybe I can just tell

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,620
that to my opinion it's important that

00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:02,180
your data is in your country I think

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:05,960
it's the case in France to the public

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,910
companies and also private companies

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,160
also won the letter to be in that

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,960
country that doesn't mean that the data

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:23,500
should be in only one place can mean

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:27,490
several places but we we see that the

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:31,630
place where the data is I mean legally

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:36,410
matters really matters so that's why we

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:39,020
with the newest project we walk to

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,160
locate the data in France and we know

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:48,380
that several cloud providers here in

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Europe or in France offer to host data

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:56,600
in other countries and we know that it's

00:24:50,960 --> 00:25:02,840
a something that is not in favor of

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:05,470
cloud adoption in France to answer to

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:09,650
your question on why Brownsville's I

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:12,500
seen one of the many show for if once a

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:16,430
cloud goes to to everywhere is

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,970
confidence and why we choose a bounce

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:23,930
house in Inuyasha is because we consider

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:28,100
than the user final user are the right

00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:32,030
to auditor code in order to be able to

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:36,290
verify than ok there's a real problem as

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:38,450
I say is done there is a very few expert

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,960
in the world which are already able to

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:44,090
do that but if the grant is a crime it's

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,650
a crime of right if you grant the right

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:50,990
to the user it we will be able if there

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,410
is any problem any trouble at the moment

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:57,470
it will be able to do that and so

00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,590
confidence truth is really the matter

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,530
and other answers and I think this is

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,630
why so many you so much governments are

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,970
looking about about open source even if

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,210
there is a lot of commercial solutions

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,550
which are ready perfect ready but many

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,080
issue now in confidence and because

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,090
there is a legal aspect because there is

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,740
economical aspect because if it's social

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,720
aspects which which flow is it at us

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,390
when you do you agree with this having

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,300
an open source experts in every layers

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,040
that you need to build this video yeah I

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,100
think that it's a requirement to have

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,870
exported at each layer and I think that

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:43,020
confidence in term of open source he is

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:48,150
a natural thing compared to commercial

00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:51,210
off-the-shelf product all right wait

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,669
well it's probably a little bit early to

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,390
get the use cases of VDC because as we

00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:59,570
as you've mentioned it's an emerging

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:02,039
virtual data center but do we have

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:05,100
lessons already learned from these

00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:17,130
trials or proof of concepts that we can

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:20,010
speak about okay I get the point we are

00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,549
looking what we are doing right now it's

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,770
laboratory ray we have connected to

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:28,890
first data centers we are improving our

00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:33,570
technology as placing incident we are

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,640
looking about partners what basically

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,610
what we are expecting now it's creating

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,929
use case so first use case is based on a

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,580
Dutch river so its own of data it's on

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,450
Dutch river which is a kind of a small

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:53,850
company which is part of new Asha and

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:57,750
which creates desktop virtual desktops

00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:01,500
so we have we have takes this case in

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:04,169
order to to implement technology and to

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,620
create a proof of concept but basically

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:09,840
what we are looking right now is opening

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,530
the test bed from New Age to measure

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,919
other cultural companies in order to get

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:21,390
feedback yeah there is when welcome a

00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,090
quick word about open source unknown

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:26,580
episodes so I mean we have seen recently

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,330
some strong reactions or proprietary

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,570
vendors

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:34,659
vmware not to name it which is very

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,360
aggressive with his license model in

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,179
order to counter-attack i will say the

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,289
open-source penetration into the cloud

00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:46,330
computing arena and one thing as a

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,990
concrete you say that we are doing is to

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,850
integrate open-source stacks like

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,429
OpenStack another framework with

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:58,419
proactive together with a popular terry

00:28:54,429 --> 00:29:00,159
licenses like a vmware solution at least

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:02,320
it is a choice to the people which

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,360
already put that figure into the

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,360
proprietary ward they can smoothly

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,000
switch to open source solution but they

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,100
will have a mixed environment and they

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,769
could choose one time to move one module

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,289
to an open source one yes and they can

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,690
design where to put the next investment

00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,130
in the platform so that's interesting

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,100
because you know virtual datacenter

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:27,360
nakano will help us probably on this the

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:31,419
capacity planning problem is duplicated

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,200
now well actually we have the capacity

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:36,700
planning problem issue I mean for

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,700
brick-and-mortar data centers or virtual

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:43,409
data centers but the fact to be virtual

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,769
I think it helps because we can choose

00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:51,399
several data centers and we you the

00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:55,980
offer of capacity planning is a is more

00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:58,600
important so I think virtual data center

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,510
answers the questions the launch of the

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,889
points of capacity planning for in many

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:09,940
cases and just to start with the formal

00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:16,299
question about open source my opinion I

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:18,940
don't initially I don't know if it's

00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:23,049
good to have open source or not but what

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:27,370
I say what I see is in our company

00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:32,769
interest we are 50 people and they all

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:38,340
the tech engineers and 0 in the people i

00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:45,510
have without I mean it's not I mean

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:47,650
cooperate decision but they all reject

00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,720
propagators of well software and they

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,600
all I mean they deconstruct the proper

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,760
preparatory the bricks to put

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,330
open-source bricks and you talk about

00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,820
open flow it's it's I mean we already we

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,940
don't have virtual virtual network we

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:08,700
have a cisco brick-and-mortar network

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:11,980
and they they want to try this is a

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,170
virtual network bricks but that's true

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:18,730
on with open attack that's true also

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:21,070
with as you said the range I mean a

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:25,960
distributed storage like object I mean

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:30,040
we we today we have proper ettore

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:34,450
clusters and we want to to do have

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:39,400
unlimited distributed storage in several

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:41,920
places and for that we our staff wants

00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,810
to choose a mint sauce Thank You liquor

00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,280
now thank you all our panel for those

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,730
Precision's thank you again we can

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,730
