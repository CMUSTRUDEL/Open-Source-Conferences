good afternoon everybody I don't know if

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,839
you can hear me very well sylvain myself

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,340
John are very pleased to introduce you

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,920
to canadia developed by hetero

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,160
technology a cloud automation and Q&As

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,109
driven management software provider it's

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,770
what it's a French company created in

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,760
2009 and our mission is to merge cloud

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,880
management platform and smart workload

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,060
management we make sure infrastructure's

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,800
adapt to companies activity we pilot the

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,550
different layers of the IT stack

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,489
hardware storage vm yes to create

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,190
automated orchestrated and scalable

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,410
services we bring to our customers

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,780
enterprises and service providers a

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,930
complete private cloud computing

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,260
solution for us the best way to optimize

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,760
an infrastructure is to manage and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,739
automate hardware and yes we do not just

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,859
turn them on and off we bring

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,809
intelligence to them in order to find

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,630
out the best configuration as possible

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,860
our customers are nowadays tired of

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,270
redundancy of reparations and especially

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,689
specifically sorry in complex

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,119
environments so what do we ask them to

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,180
do today we ask them to do more quicker

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,540
and with less budget so canopy ah helps

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,140
them resolve these kinds of issues

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,119
because of our know-how in automation

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,119
will be able to boost your whole IT

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,670
infrastructure not only do we monitor

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,540
resources but we solve the root cause

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,939
problem automatically and in real time

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:46,920
we make sure the link between resources

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,500
SLA s and requests is made so how does

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,290
it work well Canopius philosophy works

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,930
with the virtuous cycle as you can see

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,090
once the cycle is finished another one

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,490
begins so basically what you have to

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,189
remember is that we monitor the

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,490
different resources so the system

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,649
computes applications etc and we bring

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,780
the intelligence we analyze them we can

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,150
relate them to know exactly

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,950
actions have to be planned to bed to

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,890
find the best configuration as possible

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,230
and we make sure operations are made

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,720
successfully obviously say with the

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,220
workflow and deployment management and

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,800
join so can a PR is divided in six

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,050
different modules but what you have to

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,600
know is that the solution has been

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,510
developed from scratch and designed for

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,720
production environments only so each

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,120
modules have a specific know-how and

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,209
respond to a particular demand from our

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,160
customers for example the smart workload

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,950
manager is the intelligence of the

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,500
solution with the correlation engine the

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,600
rules engine the analysis and the

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,150
historical learning and you're gonna ask

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,670
me what is the historical learning well

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,160
it's for example all your sales

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,920
representative connect to the CRM at

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,900
eleven o'clock every Monday morning well

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,750
the solution will know that and then

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,540
we'll deploy the amount of resources to

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,860
anticipate the requests increase so

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,019
that's the first module of the smart

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,420
workload manager the second one is the

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,880
vm lifecycle management which is

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,030
designed to optimize virtual

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,000
environments with operations like live

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,840
migration hot add and remove of ram and

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,410
cpu and the module will actually analyze

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,890
the activity of each VM to avoid

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,959
resource waste the orchestration manager

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,150
is to make sure your operation get

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,850
successfully and that will create the

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,760
right workplace at the right moment the

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,250
sec the cloud service portal is perfect

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,109
for companies and service providers who

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,450
want to create a cloud computing offer

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,730
it's with this module that you'll be

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,340
able to create your offer a and link it

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,340
to your client a your offer be and link

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,239
it to your client B etc etc and follow

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,850
the conception of each client the full

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,940
stack deployment is the automation

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,700
before each IT layer the edge stack and

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,420
the core engine is the Glee that

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,600
combines together the diff

00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,420
module so you can either add them up to

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,350
make a solution or you can either use

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,270
them independently in your IT management

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,430
and with your IT management tools so

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,310
we're not here to replace your existing

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,090
tools we're here to bring intelligence

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,440
and complete them so now that you've

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,570
seen how it works you must be wondering

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,810
okay but what are the gains here you

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,610
will find figures from projects we have

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,920
realized so we've told you before that

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,900
we are in cost reduction time so with

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,630
Canela one of our client has been able

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,120
to save up to twenty percent of his

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,430
future investment we talked about doing

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,770
stuff quicker and yes one of our clients

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,560
used to take eight hours through

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,320
provision a yes and with can apply it

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,960
only takes in 45 minutes now we told

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,810
about occupation rate one of our service

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,810
provider used to occupy only forty-one

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,840
percent of his capacities and now is up

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,300
to 74 we talked about flexibility and

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,700
the results from one of our projects is

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,390
that with canopy our clan has been able

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,640
to switch from one year to another up to

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,760
thirty percent of its compute nodes and

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,440
that every single day and we talked

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,590
about adaptability which is the

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,950
necessary today and the ongoing loop

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:43,090
I've talked to you about adapts your

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,560
infrastructure every five minutes so now

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,290
that you've understand a little bit more

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,030
what we do silver will show you exactly

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,260
how it works and how it does it look

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,260
like well thank you very much

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,129
ok hello everybody I'm Sylvan boo boo

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,979
and I'm project manager on the canopy

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:08,129
our software and I'm more specifically

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:11,219
in charge of the automation and

00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:15,659
deployment engine of canopy since we

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:18,770
have a little time I will the demo will

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:22,590
only focus on a few key features of

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,719
canopy ax and in particular its ability

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,150
to have a real service centric vision

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,870
and how it can make it easier for you to

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:34,500
define services that match your end user

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,469
needs their end users may be the

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,810
business units if you're in your company

00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:43,229
or the curl your customers if you are

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,789
holster we shall not go in death with

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,740
how you register your existing

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:50,240
infrastructure and to canopy a bit

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,650
instead we start with a pre-configured

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,860
environment that is running in our

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,589
offices so this is the the canopy I web

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,800
console it's the single point of

00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:05,310
insurance for all the for all the

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,159
persons that will that we have two men

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,610
manage your infrastructure the first

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:14,430
kind of user is the the system

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:19,310
administrator so let's I'm gonna put my

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:24,240
system administrator hat on my job is to

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,659
to register my different resources into

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,069
canopius such as the computing resources

00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:33,330
for example they can be bare metal

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,789
servers are our cisco ucs if you have

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:40,139
one or an existing yes such as vmware

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:43,439
vsphere are whatever you have you can

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,839
also also register your storage can

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:51,940
object provides its own storage system

00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:56,800
but if you have this a net app netapp

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,080
son or whatever storage you have then I

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,800
have to declare the networks that my

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,050
infrastructure is going to use the the

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,390
IP pulls address the villains the

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,220
network topology of my infrastructure

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:14,950
and finally the system components that

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,410
will be used in my infrastructure for

00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,470
example the the operating systems are

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:25,540
the Colonel's specific carols for my

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:28,630
infrastructure so now doing the light

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,360
cycles of your so your services cannot

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,270
be as a automation engine will pilot

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,760
these equipments for example to

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:41,200
provision a new hard disk on your on

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,530
your storage and son are for example

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,820
start a new machine on your on your yes

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,310
so now that the the technical

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,850
infrastructure is a resist resistor into

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:58,480
canopy ax I'm going to put my system

00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:00,610
designer hat on so my job is to to to

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,950
define under the services that will be

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:09,460
available to my end users and and for

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,800
that you have the concept of policies so

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,430
policies can be seen as a template in

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,830
management system for your services so

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,860
there are different kinds of policies

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,750
they're hosting storage network etc so

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,390
how can be the end they can be useful to

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,630
you first they simplify the management

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,570
for non-technical persons I may not be

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,680
familiar with the different kinds of

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:38,320
storage devices are the different

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,900
computing resources then it allows you

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,420
to define the right level of quality of

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:51,530
service for for your service for example

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:54,980
let's say I want to deploy a service on

00:09:51,530 --> 00:10:00,140
a slow storage so storage or faster rich

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:05,540
or for example deploy virtual machines

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,980
on a highly available yes so and finally

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,250
through the policies you can define

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:13,210
complete service offerings with various

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,570
and customized customized thresholds and

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:20,480
for example I can limit the available

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:24,950
resources and the maximum number of

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,230
nodes of my services and once you define

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,620
all your policies you are going to

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,200
combine them into your policies into

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,600
services so that you can build whatever

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,040
service you want you want for example

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:44,720
here you have a full lamp stack that is

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:50,690
deployed on a highly available yes so

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,820
and so i'm going to show you i'm going

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,030
to show you how now that we've defined

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,400
our services how concretely we can

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,380
instantiate a service for a particular

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,140
business units are a customer for for

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:10,580
hosting company i would typically put my

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,650
cells represent represented hat or or in

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,030
another company i would be someone from

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:25,270
the art department in charge of

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:25,270
instantiating the service so sorry

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,260
yeah okay so now that we've defined

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:37,220
let's say that in my company the HR

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,580
department wants to deploy a new HR

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,459
management system so let's say two it's

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,089
a web-based application that uses a lamb

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:51,649
steak a lamp stack that we've talked

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:57,709
about so this is really easy I just

00:11:51,649 --> 00:12:02,950
instantiate a service sorry about that

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:02,950
to be long I just give it a name

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:15,850
so this is the customer is my HR

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:20,020
department and are you going to use the

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,340
service we defined earlier and then i

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,350
can ok i will show you all the

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,600
underlying policies that will be used

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,340
for the service the hosting policies the

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,110
orchestrations storage the network

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,150
everything and you can customize

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,000
customize it for this particular

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,620
instance you if you define a few

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,010
networks on a service but you want to

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,280
add more you can do this or even deploy

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:49,510
a new company software components like

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:53,440
an ldap server on this instance so let's

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:59,080
take a look at an existing instance this

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,870
is this is a living instance you have an

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,320
overview of what's going on on your

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,050
service on your instance like the cpu

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,190
usage of your service the variable

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:16,330
memory this is you can customize it you

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:19,720
can you can add the revenants indicators

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,310
you can also see the resources the

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,100
computing resources that are used by

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,720
your buyer instance like literally here

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,870
we can see that we have to do turn

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,770
machines typically i can i can click and

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,080
scale add more ram tamiya to one of few

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,250
notes I can see the software

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,470
configuration of my instance I can I can

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,800
see here that I have a load balancer a

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,820
load balancer I can configure it through

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,060
this through this tab you also have a

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,520
journal of all the events of your of

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,010
your service for example if there was a

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,160
power failure power failure our

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,530
maintenance or something like that or

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,190
the world sir the instant was stopped

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:11,920
everything is listed here he also have

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:15,490
access to the smart smart workload

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,450
manager here you can configure rules so

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:22,540
for example here we can see that if

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:27,040
cpu load is too high on my online

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:30,250
infrastructure then a new new server

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,910
will be spoon and can okay i will

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:38,080
automatically deploy it and configure

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:41,110
everything so here you had a quick

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,630
overview of kind of caño pia key

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:48,010
features and i hope that you have now a

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:50,560
more clear idea of how can appiah can

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,350
help you can be useful in your

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,680
environment and how it can be integrated

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,900
self into your environment so if you

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,130
