It has been deployed in Africa and used to stimulate open innovation in emerging countries.

It aims to build a reference library of business applications under free licenses. The project has recently joined OW2 and aims to publish 2 versions of the solution: a standalone version and a Telco grade version. See the main portal http://www.emerginov.org for more details.
