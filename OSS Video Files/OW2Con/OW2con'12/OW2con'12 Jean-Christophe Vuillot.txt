Description: 
	OpenPaaS: the open-source Enterprise Social network for the Cloud -Jean-Christophe Vuillot, Linagora
Abstract : The OpenPaaS project aims at developing an Open-Source Enterprise Social Network that leverage OBM collaborative solution and Petals BPM workflow engine and run-time. Leaded by LINAGORA, the French Open-Source Software leader, OpenPaaS addresses the whole collaborative application life-cycle. It provides basic features such as profile definition, collaborative mail, agenda, forms and workflow editors as well as an open API for external contributors. OpenPaaS's run-time reuses Petals BPEL process engine and Petals Enterprise Service Bus. These tools are deployed on an hybrid IaaS infrastructure that allows to connect heterogeneous external applications. OpenPaaS project is funded by the FSN (Fond National pour la Société Numérique).

good afternoon everybody my name is john

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,200
christow vu I'm head of product at in

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,780
agoura and i'm in charge of the the

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,049
development of the open pass product my

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,700
colleague John PLO a who is head of

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,050
research I was supposed to make this

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,939
presentation he couldn't make it so I

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,279
replaced him I'm not the technical

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,359
experts even though the core team of

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,910
Linda gray as of today is made of

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,740
software developers but I want to

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,590
nevertheless to give you another view

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,079
but both the open pass project and the

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,559
upon past product starting at the in

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,800
agoura I guess you heard about the Nagra

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,070
earlier today so I want to go in details

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,079
about it just to mention that among

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,949
other activities in anger I software

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:58,350
vendor delivering products and one of

00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:02,750
this product is today OPM OBM let's say

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,700
opium which is a platform dedicated to

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,580
enterprise collaboration services when I

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,470
say enterprise it's obviously both for

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,710
enterprise but as well for public

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,060
administration this administration being

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,590
the core

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,049
of the customer base of in a garage

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,000
today Obama has had the long long life

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,659
now it's time to think about the next

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,270
generation of that product so in

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,759
coordination with that in agoura has

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,479
decided to develop the next generation

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,810
of these products and 52 found the

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,470
development of this product linearize

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,990
engaging is different research projects

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,750
project where both academic and

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,780
industrials are willing or have to work

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:56,100
together and one of these projects very

00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:01,259
exciting project is open paths so open

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:05,640
pass is or will be an open sins open

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,979
source platform in the cloud that can be

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,860
deployed on different types of clouds

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:16,290
whether they are private hybrid or

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,209
public it's a pass which will be really

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:29,579
dedicated to enterprise collaboration

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:31,859
and social network services so before

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:35,489
going leads a bit deeper in in the

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:38,640
rotation of app open pass they are they

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,280
are basic principles about up and pass

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,670
or let's say challenges it has to be on

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,480
the cloud it has and with this project

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,480
and these products because the evolution

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,880
of the open past project will become in

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,150
a grab product with the same name open

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,220
pass but with this project and with this

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,670
product we really want to find the best

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,549
possible trade off between new and

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,639
proven proven technologies and

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,940
technologies that can adapt to cloud

00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,260
computing environment and again

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,190
technologies with which give the tools

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,510
and the environment to be able to deploy

00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,480
services that are meant to be

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,720
using social network services or

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,120
collaboration services or applications

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,500
so open pass is a pass obviously so we

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,130
will provide we will provide the open

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,510
all the necessary open API s and

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,250
development and deployment environment

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,140
necessary to software developers so that

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,260
they can they can develop their own

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:49,430
applications but open pass will also

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,490
provide modeling business process

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,380
modeling tools and these tools will be

00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,900
used by both software developers

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,240
technical people and by non-technical

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,000
people so namely business experts and

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,250
the M with these tools is to make sure

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,080
that both technical people and business

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,470
expense can work together to define

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,510
model eyes implement and deploy new

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,490
services and again when i say services

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,500
application it's always in this context

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,070
of social network and collaboration

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,170
environment coming with open paths there

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,900
will be an off-the-shelf SAS offering

00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,870
which you can see here and most of the

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:32,000
components that you see in indices of

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:34,400
race offering are what OPM is today so

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,910
typically name Nick calendar application

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,060
mail services contact application

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,970
instant messaging some of the services

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:50,360
will be part of this suffering like the

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:52,250
digital volt and this service will be

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,620
coming from another project another

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,060
research project that we're in agoura is

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:02,630
the name leader which is G safe it's a

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,370
digital volt which is running or

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,730
supposed to run on a government-backed

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,890
cloud and not only with the despot you

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,480
can store documents but you can also of

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,969
course sign them you can watermark

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,329
documents you can as well

00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:20,459
yes as well a central service for

00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:23,699
validation and confirmation of signature

00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,069
and tracking logs so it's kind of like

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,229
the I don't know the right english term

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,779
but it's like evidence management or

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,360
proven management to be able to to prove

00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:40,229
that the right document has been signed

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:43,229
by the by you the right person and again

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:46,039
so another requirement weapon pass is to

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:52,679
be able to be deployed on beauteous

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:55,319
environments so this is some rise of

00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:59,459
summary of what I've been saying so far

00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,799
more less the other partners in the the

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,769
open pass protect our lawyer telecom SI

00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:06,629
TI and I mean that's the academics

00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:10,499
academic partners we have a business

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:12,989
partner bike across working in the food

00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:16,229
industry and they have they have

00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:18,299
identified real needs both from a

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,629
collaboration point of view they we are

00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:24,269
willing to use social network in in in

00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:26,489
their company and they are also very

00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:29,939
interested in how we would be possible

00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:33,389
to model eyes processes because most of

00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:37,110
their business our process related so

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:39,869
far in Agra rights human in an important

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,239
human investment so minimum 10 men

00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:44,819
you're doing three years that means that

00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:48,749
we we are we need people so we are

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:51,839
actually recruiting developers technical

00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:54,629
mostly technical people but not only so

00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,409
I just want you to say that okay in Agra

00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:01,019
is willing to to get in touch with the

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:04,319
right persons and again the key words

00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,699
and the main challenges and the source

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,540
of innovation of that project and that

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,090
and and the the

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,800
and that the product that will be

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,330
launched by by negara is to focus in

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,510
enterprise collaboration services social

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:23,620
network to deploy this offering in a

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,950
cloud-based environment and also to have

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,950
a reach of rain when it comes to

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,210
modernizing business processes something

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,610
i haven't mentioned so far it's the

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,100
security and reliability that's a strong

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,680
no know how it in agoura at lena cova as

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,720
well and when talking about social

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,700
network or collaboration services that

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,480
means that you are dealing with a lot of

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,010
data most of them sensitive data and

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,140
even more when it's in the cloud it's

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,600
very important that the kia you can

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:59,500
provide a high level of security and

00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:02,580
readability when it comes to the

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,800
architecture it's still working progress

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,080
yesterday we started our first sprint

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,770
development based on a very very basic

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,730
use case but it's a kind of way up to 22

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,750
kicking off the development efforts even

00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,970
if it's the work in progress

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,190
yeah yeah we got an overview it's a non

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,310
committing one because the final it's a

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:29,690
very early draft but that is you can see

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,330
that we have three main layers and

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,760
server-side the core layer that you see

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,800
here is meant to be a kind of reserved

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:42,800
area for for the the open position Matt

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,170
in agoura the services and the apps

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,790
areas will be will be open and available

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:52,130
for for everybody we want to start with

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,470
a simple architecture and we will have a

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,480
very kind of agile centric approach

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,660
meaning that during the first

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,520
development Sprint's the code

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,620
refactoring will be much more than just

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,330
the concepts we will do a lot of it but

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,850
that's the will want to go start and as

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:15,620
we go see how we can adapt and improve

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:18,670
the choice we made in the beginning so

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:23,089
just to give some some some examples so

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,550
open typical open pass applications will

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,280
may or may not depend on on open past

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,490
services or may depend on other open

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,320
pass applications and open open pass

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,690
application may deploy its own service

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,430
when it comes to the services they have

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,620
they will have their own execution

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,770
environment they will provide different

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:50,780
sets of api's any any any service will

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,940
have to be registered in the repository

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:57,430
component which is located in the core

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:01,040
layer and this service the directory

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:05,200
service will contain all the instances

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,200
of running services at any given time

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,430
