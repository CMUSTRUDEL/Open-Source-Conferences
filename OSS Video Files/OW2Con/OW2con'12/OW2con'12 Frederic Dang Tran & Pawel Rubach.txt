Description: 
	The Sirocco multi-cloud management framework - Frédéric Dang Tran, Orange Labs & Paweł Rubach, Orange Poland
Abstract : While private cloud solutions as well as public cloud service offers are numerous, effective management still remains a challenge where it comes to multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployment models where applications span several clouds. This presentation gives an overview of the OW2 Sirocco multi-cloud management framework with a particular focus on two topics: API mediation and placement management. Sirocco allows consumers to provision resources on multiple cloud providers whether private or public and relies on an orchestration layer that hides the heterogeneity of the underlying providers (in terms of API, virtualization technology...) through a unified user interface and API. Sirocco has adopted the DMTF Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) whose 1.0 release was released on 29 August 2012. Internally, this unified API is translated to the specific API and virtual resource model of each provider. Sirocco currently supports Amazon EC2, VMware vCloud Director as well as OpenStack as back-end clouds. A key component of Sirocco focuses on provider selection and placement management, namely how to select a cloud provider that offers the best match between the client request (QoS, geographical constraints...) and the provider's capabilities. Sirocco integrates a flexible decision-making framework that relies on a rule-based engine.
