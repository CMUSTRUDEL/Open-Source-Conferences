welcome mark so we start now okay good

00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:23,259
morning my name is Mark weitzel I like

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,859
many folks who work with 0 W to an open

00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:29,079
source I have two roles I have sort of

00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,480
my day job which is director of platform

00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,070
and ecosystem of jive software and I'm

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,720
also the president of the OpenSocial

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,240
Foundation and it's in that role that

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm going to talk to you today about

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,710
OpenSocial about moving beyond portal

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,410
traditional portals into this idea of

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,900
social middleware and so really we're

00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,670
going to talk about four things or so

00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,500
we're going to talk first about this

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,630
idea of social middleware and what

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,400
exactly it is then we're going to talk

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,600
about social applications we talked

00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,340
about you know we heard the earlier

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,170
speaker talk about sort of on-demand

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,610
type of applications that can be

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,190
delivered and we're going to talk about

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,930
how that changes when you have a social

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,510
layer there then we're going to talk a

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,770
little bit about what OpenSocial is it's

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,840
a standard and we're going to talk about

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,610
what it does and then of course why

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,130
standards are awesome awesome right okay

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,200
so in the old days right we had all of

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,330
these systems of record in our

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,729
enterprises right and they're all sort

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,670
of siloed whether their HR systems

00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,990
whether they're CMS systems it doesn't

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,060
matter they're all there and you sort of

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,440
go to each one and you use each one and

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,159
you jump around and that's it but

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,520
they're all sort of siloed and today for

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,920
some crazy reason right everybody wants

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,619
to be friends right and we have this

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,780
notion of people and connectedness and

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,970
relationships right and this is we're

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,530
conditioned to this now through Facebook

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,930
and Twitter and things like that right

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,570
so this this notion of activities and

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,000
having a stream is permeating everything

00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,890
that we do in our consumer world right

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,650
in our private worlds and it turns out

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,439
that as we go into enterprise and as we

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:08,019
go to work right every day we have these

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,599
same concepts we have these same things

00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,120
that are there in our work right we have

00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,590
you know the

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,209
profile the things that were good at

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,209
that we want to advertise and let people

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,920
know about and we have also the

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,049
relationship the connectedness that we

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,750
have between people in our organizations

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,430
often way outside of our org chart right

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,890
the people that you work with on a daily

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,489
basis often aren't in your direct

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,879
organizational chain right or are our

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:38,010
structures are very very different and

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,980
of course you have that stream of

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,390
information that flows that you need to

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,549
be aware of things that are happening

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,140
yuly around the content of the document

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,329
you're following are the people of

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,180
what's happening right so all of these

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:53,220
things that we see now in the in in the

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,489
social world that we're so accustomed to

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,239
really surface themselves in inside our

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,909
enterprise as well and so what a social

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,700
middleware platform does fundamentally

00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,859
is allow you to change these systems of

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,349
record into systems of engagement right

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:16,919
it starts to be that glue that ties all

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:19,410
of these things together and of course

00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,519
you know you have to be open right so

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,739
there are there are two major projects

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,150
in the open in open source that are

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:33,450
driving that are driving social

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,160
middleware one is Apache shindig right

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,180
that's an open-source reference

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,340
framework and apache rave which is an

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,230
open-source reference implementation

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,150
take shindig and sort of fills in the

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,799
gaps and make it much more consumable

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:54,599
right so now we have an open platform

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:58,650
for building social middleware and so

00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:02,310
what is open social and that is excuse

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,590
me opensocial is an industry standard so

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,199
it started back in two thousand eight in

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,139
the consumer world with Google and Yahoo

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,299
and a few others and it was really this

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,449
idea of building an open community

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:19,320
around a consistent platform and social

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:22,169
layer and that you could now start to

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,139
take and build social applications and

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:28,289
it was around that time in 2008-2009

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,449
as large enterprise vendors like IBM and

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,969
SI p and jive and and others we're

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,979
looking at this saying you know we have

00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:37,379
a portal model today and that portal

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,840
model is is very very constrained right

00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,270
I get a little box on a dashboard and

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,580
what we're seeing now is the move away

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,319
from dashboard into streams right we're

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,569
seeing this ability to deliver

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,580
components that have a social context

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,650
inside of them right that are aware of

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,659
the connectedness and can use that

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,999
information intelligently in their

00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,129
business logic okay and that's what we

00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:00,569
mean when we talk about a social

00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,629
business application right it's a

00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,490
cloud-based service that leverages that

00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,860
social context that connectedness

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,379
between things the relationships that

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,150
you have as a fundamental underpinning

00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,159
of business logic right and there's

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,520
there's lots of examples of these things

00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:18,990
right so for example co-worker

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,210
recognition is one of my favorite

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,069
examples because how often do you go

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,650
into your annual performance review and

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,999
try to tell your boss well no this is

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,039
what I did and they're like what you did

00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:31,680
that how where did you do that right

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,689
they didn't know and so having the

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,569
ability to be recognized by your peers

00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,310
and have that virally spread throughout

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,860
your organization and have that

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,800
accumulated naturally inherently as part

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,069
of the business logic of that new way to

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,159
do HR systems now that's a very powerful

00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,349
model and a very powerful mechanism for

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:58,649
you to be recognized and have more

00:05:52,349 --> 00:06:01,379
visibility and we talked about this just

00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,229
a few minutes ago right this having an a

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:07,979
and a standard based component model now

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,649
allows you know exciting new economics

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,719
of delivering applications into an

00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,210
enterprise right you don't longer have

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,490
to buy the big monolithic you know

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,399
packaged software suite you can buy and

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,229
use only what you want to use and when

00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,779
you're done or you don't like it ah you

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,789
get rid of it right so the same consumer

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,250
model that we're starting to be used to

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,870
with our phones right are now we're

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,870
starting to see happen in the enterprise

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,339
right we can change the way we deliver

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,050
fundamentally applications into the

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,470
enterprise and we can allow those

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,510
applications to

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,250
use that social context and be aware of

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:46,510
that connectedness inside of our

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,010
enterprise and of course standards are

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,640
awesome right and the reason they're

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,710
awesome is for for the same it is

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,630
because a foster competition they allow

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,730
us to cooperate at a particular level

00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,530
and compete at a different level so they

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,540
actually elevate what we're able to do

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:06,280
right so they facilitate all of those

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,780
the competition than the cooperation and

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:15,760
they also enable choice for consumers

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:18,100
and for vendors an OpenSocial is the

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,740
only community driven standard that's

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,560
out there today with a robust open

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,690
source ecosystem behind it that enables

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,460
this and is driven by the community and

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:41,260
is broadly accepted in the industry

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:43,570
how'd I do merci thank you neck same

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,260
excellence at this rate we're going to

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,910
be early and we expected to be paid well

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,240
thank you Mark thank you very much I

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,919
think there is a lot and I want to say

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,050
that we are starting these discussions

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,280
with open socials because we reckon

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,160
there is a lot in common between

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,890
notability to an OpenSocial not only

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,479
with one some of the members being with

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,669
sharing some members but we also share

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,800
some interests and in the enterprise

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,180
application delivery paradigm that they

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,729
are talking about is something that is

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,280
very important for us amber please work

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,919
on my next keynote speaker and old

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,080
friends and old hands in the open source

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
