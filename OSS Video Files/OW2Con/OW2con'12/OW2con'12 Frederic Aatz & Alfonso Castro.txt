what back so Frederick gasps as it was

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,269
mentioned I'm responsible for the

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,480
strategy of open source and interop in

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,750
France so i would i will start my my

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,029
talk but by saying that what I what are

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,689
you doing here Microsoft I I I sometimes

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,880
have the question and and if I was to

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,620
put a few words and a few words to be

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,079
taken out of this meeting it is it's for

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,440
its for four points the third walk the

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,260
first one is one from the mantle and the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,559
three other points are our key

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,960
engagements that we are taking which our

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,170
customers collaboration and partnership

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,910
and I mention the word partnership and

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,820
cloud back on the approach back on the

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,980
approach it's been it's been a ten-year

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,580
approach and and the new things behind

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,100
that it's it became the mature strategy

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,740
so we do have a strategy behind enter up

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,110
and open source it's been a 10-year

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,509
tenure one and we are we are becoming

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,270
mature around that and with maturity

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,100
comes a little less of shyness as you

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,920
probably heard this morning during the

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,640
discussion we are taking a more

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,850
proactive approach we are building

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,720
programs on gagement sand and and really

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,720
being a deeper into that strategy the

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,140
free points customers partners and

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,579
partnership and an cloud talking about

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,860
customers we do engage in really

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,500
listening deeply and proactively to

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,159
customers hearing from in the early age

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,899
interop strategy but also more and more

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,549
about the workloads that they are

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,490
willing to adopt and in front of that

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:05,070
taking the real real pragmatic pragmatic

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,509
approach behind that and in some cases

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,930
adopt in other cases

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:15,900
collaborate an interrupt and it could be

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,439
if I take a few examples and back to my

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,110
really being pragmatic it could be for

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,150
the consumer side delivering skype on

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,360
linux because customers are are are

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,739
willing to have that it could be

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,950
implementing and we did that three years

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,470
ago in Paris you see Leah Marino 10

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,379
minutes walk from here and interrupt lab

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,319
where we do where we did early in

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,510
early-stage implement technologies in

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,000
terms of showcasing interrupt and more

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,650
and more on this is this is a a couple

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,930
of weeks ago more and more engaging

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,420
offerings as well as services in in our

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,220
customers asking what about my mixed

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,200
environment what should i do how could I

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,420
should I proceed what are the savings

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,299
that I could like I could expect from

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,819
from your approach I venture up and and

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,040
and an open source what I what I might

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,200
what am I taking out of that I'm

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,000
building my cloud what should i do how

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,609
could I go and and this is a mixed

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,030
environment once again collaboration and

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:21,060
I mentioned earlier the word partnership

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,400
because whether it be with with big

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,090
partners when I say partners it could be

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,419
big big integrators whether it be it be

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,870
with is vs for example or with with

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,120
communities it's all about building a

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,599
relationship a collaboration where in

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,629
some cases we will help and support in

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,709
other cases we will engage and

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,530
co-develop and we have the structure for

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,750
that for that and in other cases and in

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,870
most of the cases see how we can do

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,299
business together and in those cases it

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,579
could be whether it's the PHP community

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,269
or the MongoDB popping community we're

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:03,120
more than happy to discuss with the

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:06,359
autoblow w2 community and co particular

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,209
one we are more than happy to discuss

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,829
with cloud cloud wat it's all about

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,989
building the relationship or the

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,049
technology interaction to make sure that

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,680
those mix environments can run and run

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,530
safely and

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,960
well as it was told this morning with

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,570
the right interrupt choices where you

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,370
can pick and choose the model that you

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,169
want to follow up whether it's ten

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,150
percent of that and eighty percent of

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,740
that if you want to mix it we need

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,419
really to make sure that we deliver them

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:41,500
that next and last point on the on that

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:44,169
on that major slide quite simple it's

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,770
the cloud so talking about the cloud

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:50,169
it's all about not only are offering

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,139
Asia as I mentioned our public out cloud

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,960
offering that that power have about 30

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,849
different technologies that came out

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,120
from the open source the good example

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,820
that we have this morning is the a dupe

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,340
with northern works and making sure that

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,550
when we deliver on the open on the the

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:14,650
public cloud we do deliver with all the

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:18,009
communities all the ice vs our partners

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,110
are willing to be to be available on the

00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:24,070
cloud and make sure that the experience

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,949
is seamless you did make some choice in

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,690
terms of that package that that model of

00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:30,729
development it needs to be to be

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,169
seamless and he needs to interact with

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:38,590
other clouds I need to kind of not steal

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:41,199
your time man and and once I said that

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,360
open source moment I might not got those

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,820
are numbers but but numbers are somehow

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,889
important and and they illustrate the

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,680
different aspects whether it be on the

00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,770
left hand side around the development

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,870
making sure that the person's the team's

00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:00,900
the companies that have made have made

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:04,120
some ex model model of the development

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,759
choices that they really can land on

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,190
that ecosystem that represent windows

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,530
there is once again there is no open

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,870
sewers or Microsoft there is open source

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,729
and Microsoft there is windows there is

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,039
open source that lands on Windows and he

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,990
needs to learn nicely and really

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:25,520
screamed embarrassed easily and that's

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,979
my red rocket red red yeah

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,840
windows is is really a target for the

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,300
open source community and last but not

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,009
least talking about partnerships it

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,389
could be private cloud as we mentioned

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,020
it could be public cloud it could be

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:41,680
hybrid making sure that any anyone

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,590
developing some websites whatever

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,599
development could be drupal joomla and

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,669
so forth it could learn nicely and

00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:52,159
easily with with streamlined from the

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:55,099
development to the install whether it's

00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,830
on the public cloud or with some private

00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:00,830
holsters like like neda Seymour Ellie be

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,020
your equal I'd France for example so

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,120
once again it's it's it's that momentum

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,860
that we are trying to build one of the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,020
kind of the poster child of are the more

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,000
more advanced I would say a word I we've

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,550
we've been doing and and and now we

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,069
gotta kind of skip really quick through

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,930
that slide it's all about linux it's

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,969
it's one of the example it's probably

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,069
the more and more advanced it started a

00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:25,099
couple of years ago by contributing to

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:28,520
the to the to the Linux community and it

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:31,039
goes up to making sure that we do have

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,590
some seamless experience when you

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,889
develop and package application on Linux

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,560
or Windows making sure that in in the

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,490
cloud I didn't mention earlier OpenStack

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,729
making sure that if you do mix

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,319
environments compatible one OpenStack

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,509
make sure that that it lands nicely

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,610
interrupt nicely we do have our agenda

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,349
we still do have our agenda but we do

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,930
make sure that when the agenda of the

00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:00,650
customers or the partners are mixed it

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:04,400
is it is easy to do opensuse I'm gonna

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:07,789
skip that one for you and and and and it

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,569
is it is really nice when we can read

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:14,000
through those this type of example it's

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,880
rewarding somehow because it gives us

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,229
the the mirror aspect of well we are

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,719
consistent we do have a long-term

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,729
strategy on that and when when our

00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:26,389
partners or other people we talked to

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:28,370
our are all telling these are our or

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:31,190
norton watch this morning it's really

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,860
great it's really nice to hear because

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:37,190
it's kind of a proof point of our

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,750
serious we try to be

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,210
another question I do get sometimes is

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,800
how many guys are are in Microsoft

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,680
within Microsoft working on open source

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,020
and and i can tell you i don't know the

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,210
answer what i can tell you is how we are

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,860
organized to work with in some cases

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,750
it's full time job like mine and that

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,540
would be the kind of the big circle

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,850
that's I'm the local guy working in

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,760
terms of explaining but engaging as well

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,820
customers partners but behind that there

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,800
are all different groups one of each one

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,690
of the one is open technologies you

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,900
might have heard of that company that we

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,150
we started a year ago now nearly but

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,640
it's really dedicated to work to working

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,490
with communities and contributing toward

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,110
to true to that part of the job

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,600
obviously there is work that is done

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,630
within the product group windows office

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,580
whatever a windows server that are

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,970
absolutely embedded could be it could be

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,140
many people as part of one team the open

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,990
source technology center that is

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,780
absolutely sustaining all those of

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,990
efforts and last but not least because

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,940
we do have the the worldwide guide here

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:49,320
the open solution group that is with

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,870
absolutely for targeting the business

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,650
behind it with that the open source

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,390
group is there Alfonso Castro thanks

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,890
friend so yeah let me go into the

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,710
details about what the Open Solutions

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,190
Group does so as the slide shows we are

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,260
the business part of the of that

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,180
community not meaning that we they are

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,800
the only guys doing business with open

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,530
source of Microsoft but this is really

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,720
our overall goal I will not go too much

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,000
into those details because I want please

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,040
to remain within the time frame that has

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,610
been given to us but you can see here

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,830
that we have lots of customers that are

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,540
in touch with us and that are using or

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,610
consuming open source technologies

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,100
through Microsoft a for a good example

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,150
is that is the one haven't got a

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,700
described in a second the relationship

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,010
we have with sue say we have more than

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,910
1,000 customers across the globe that

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,580
come to us for Microsoft to make

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,420
proposals in supporting linux servers

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,010
yes you heard well we make the proposals

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,990
and we

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,630
sign the contract with customers and we

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,640
take care of those Linux servers from a

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,190
support point of view we don't operate

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,800
that Suzy does that so we act as a

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,810
reseller of Suzy but the connection the

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,670
contractor connection is made through

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,920
Microsoft so that's something which is

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,860
really welcomed very well because it

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,170
rings a lot of cost-saving to our our

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,360
customers so that alliance and I'm sorry

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,460
about the title that so the important

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,530
word is in the Alliance is hidden here

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,440
but whatever is read about those three

00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,180
pillars choice because as we mentioned

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,730
this morning during the the panel the

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,710
choice is absolutely critical to all of

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,080
our customers everything we've done with

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:32,000
suz is based on interoperability we

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,220
compete and I'm going to say that again

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,490
we compete with Suzy it doesn't prevent

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,920
us from also collaborating so if it's

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,630
when we go to a customer and the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,180
customer wants to choose between linux

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,250
and windows they will do the job we will

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,200
do ours and we will definitely promote

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,510
each one our technology but that's not

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,460
the kind of conversation in which we are

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,190
involved we're involved in conversations

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,440
in which the caution wants to keep both

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,140
linux and windows and this is where

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,550
we've been collaborating with them from

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,960
a technical point of view from a

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,880
business point of view i talked about

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,000
the business part of it a second ago but

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,670
those customers and about also the

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,060
collaboration in future roadmap and in

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,040
joint color joint development of course

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,430
that brings openness to both platforms

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,130
to sue say one and also Microsoft one

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,900
then if you apply that to Microsoft and

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,020
talking about cloud because this is the

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,980
the afternoon sessions of obviously that

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,770
will enrich very much our own private

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,410
cloud story because based on hyper-v

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,720
which as you all know is our hypervisor

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,260
you will be able to virtualize equally

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,630
with Windows and Linux VMs and then

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,490
we'll be able to manage them through the

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,520
combination of system center which is

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,190
our management solutions and Suzy

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,870
manager which is Susie's management

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,630
solution for them to manage the Linux

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,900
machines so with that we are able to

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,680
provide the market with choice but also

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,529
with consistency

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,470
because if we don't want to pay the

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:09,960
price with that and make the customers

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,760
having to choose but also having to

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,930
manage the complexity of having two

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,660
different environments so that

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,550
consistency is brought to you thanks to

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,920
the curation we have with them and of

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,130
course we're now also extending that to

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,320
the public cloud because as you know on

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,720
Windows Azure and as for Rick was just

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,029
mention that you can find Linux virtual

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,490
machines as well you can find four of

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,740
them you can find Susan opensuse thanks

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,480
to collaboration I just mentions you can

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,120
also find Santos and you can find new

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,470
bhuntu so we are the other group at

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,709
microsoft that how to work with those

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,720
companies for making that happen and for

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,670
us to promote exactly the picture you

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,649
have in front of you you have one

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,140
management console in that case system

00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:55,410
center that will be would allow you to

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,000
have a comprehensive approach across all

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,490
the cloud whether they're private or

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,190
public still maintaining the choice

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,890
between the windows VMS and the linens

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,440
VMS so you can have the choice all the

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,810
time here you have one summary of the

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,790
collaboration we have wassu say i will

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:17,570
stop here so you can read the details

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,570
