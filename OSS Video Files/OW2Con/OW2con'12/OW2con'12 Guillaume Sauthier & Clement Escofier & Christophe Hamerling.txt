Description: 
	Development 2.0 @ OW2 - Clément Escoffier, Arrow-Group ; Guillaume Sauthier, Peergreen and Christophe Hamerling, Linagora
Abstract : OW2 has traditionally provided an infrastructure based on Subversion and GForge. However, software development is evolving toward a more distributed, social, flexible, and lean process. This talk presents how OW2 is embracing this new trend and the new tools and possibilities offered for your OW2 project. From the source code repository (Svn, Git@OW2, GitHub...) and bug trackers, to continuous integration and documentation, OW2 lets you develop your project using your own process and tools. Thanks to the quality tools promoted by OW2, your project benefits from quality tracking and labeling. Be more reactive, improve your efficiency, and increase your quality with OW2.

	00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,210
everybody thank you to be there for this

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:19,939
session I want you to present yourself

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,430
first so maybe you can stay on stage

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:27,269
here's a first can watch Kofi which is

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,179
the R&D head of R&D in the arrow group

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,880
he is a project leader of chameleon on

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,829
are so the I apache ipod row component

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,739
model project leader then we have a

00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:45,030
cristo vimana which is passionately the

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,629
developers in potassium and myself I'm

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,110
give such a I'm walking in pure green on

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:56,370
the we'll talk about development to that

00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,109
Oh in a w-2 so here's a tagline for

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:05,189
these decisions it will we will talk

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:08,520
about what we have now support on what

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,320
we want to have in the future so from

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,200
fridge to distribute it developer

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,140
service that we call that's development

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:25,200
as a service as joke so I will start by

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:28,979
what what there was in a w-2 in fact it

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,549
was one it was object web object web we

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:40,890
had the g forge system was set wonderful

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:44,159
user experience interface yeah but at

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,299
the time object was a forerunner because

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,890
it was an all in one integrated

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:53,520
solutions there was CVS with a view a

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,560
 view of rio so sees you had an

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,299
integrated back tracker you had some

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,329
fine management for publication of your

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,770
release you have an hudson syndication

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,960
with RSS feeds with news so you can

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,239
communicate about your release another

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,260
value in object web so what's also

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,960
mailing list on

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,170
because we had a lot of projects we have

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,970
some role management's everything based

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:27,260
on on some ldap system so it was great

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,440
but we had to make an instrument to the

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,640
platform because object rabbit was in

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,050
two thousand and was quite old so the

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,180
awesome technical chance in the meantime

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:44,900
so for example we had to enhance jihad

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:48,350
to move from CVS to svn where we

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,910
introduced also in the Forge wiki system

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:55,460
at first it was GSP wiki but then we had

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,580
to integrate more product because

00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:03,070
project will we're asking for more

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:07,640
features from the forge so for example

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,720
we had some experiences for your project

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,980
Ivan the owt website is hosted on XP key

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,570
and we had some tools such are of daily

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:25,060
use for developers like gerra a very

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:29,390
known on the very useful issue tracker

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,000
for the ecology part we had bamboo a

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,980
continuous integration system on fish I

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,180
to have some better view of sources we

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:44,140
also have to integrate some new stuff

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:47,110
guitar loose it's quite recent a year

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,810
this year in fact we had to integrate

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:55,400
get into a forum so we choose guitar use

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:59,630
at this time and we also have integrated

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,210
some maven repository manager which is

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,690
called Nexus by sonatype and we also

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:11,060
have a jabber for the instant messaging

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:14,030
system so everything is quite working

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:19,070
quite well at that man so so far it's

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,960
good for developers because it's working

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,820
for centralized workflow you walk in

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,950
your place you commit to the reference

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,420
plan to CVS or CSV n

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,570
and you have to do a project seemed

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,970
clearly defined who is in who's out but

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,070
as you have seen tools uh Scott read all

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,430
the room the place so it's difficult to

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,130
manage out of this stuff and sometimes

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,820
tools are not unified for examples user

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,010
base is quite sometimes your account

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,980
works sometimes it doesn't work so it's

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:52,670
difficult for the users on everything

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,470
makes a contribution wall too high so

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:59,750
it's difficult for an open source

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:04,040
organization so it's bit infrastructure

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:08,510
now maybe but not it's it's not

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:12,490
completely lost because there is a new

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,610
hope on eyelids talk to speech to kemah

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,110
thank you so yeah I will speak about

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,300
what we can do today and how we can

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,130
improve our development process and

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,530
efficiency in development and quality of

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,260
course with the new tools that we are

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,140
going are already integrated inside the

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,320
auto blue to fraud the kind of new fraud

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,090
also yes it's a new hope and while this

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,680
morning on our presentation the world

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,590
social was coined it's a social world so

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,180
the first thing is before was using

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,980
pretty centralized system like CVS or

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,310
subversion now we are switching to a

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,130
more decentralized system with get you

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,250
can use material to the main difference

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,530
is that you are not linked to one

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,690
process or one workflow you don't have

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,850
any one reference you can have multiple

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,470
reference everybody every contributor

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,390
every user can have the complete history

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,850
on his own machine stopped working and

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,970
so on and so you can define your own

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,420
process and for distributed team it's

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,190
really really useful you have the

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,350
concept of fork and this is very

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,170
important to you you see that on this

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:27,470
picture so what you have is ok you have

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe one reference and then people are

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,480
 it so they have a copy of all

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,050
your source code but it's still linked

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,000
to you to it to your reference so they

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,680
modified it so we see

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,930
the different type of commits and so on

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,320
and sonnets on we see which branch which

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,630
fork is in advance and so on and then we

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,110
can say okay so we can try to

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,970
reconciliate them and so on this is

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,560
really important to be able to waco see

00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:00,500
yet easily and that and it's there where

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:05,210
the socialization is take the biggest

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:08,660
place in this game is the pull request

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:11,090
concept so before what we have on Apache

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,820
or what we had before no w2 is you have

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,000
your project some burgers on your future

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,890
and somebody contributor part so it

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,040
should work on something like that and

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:24,680
you need to apply the part but well okay

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,910
Apaches of taya text file there is more

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,140
as no description you can have

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,480
description in you know it's to track

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,430
and so on but it's hard to follow and

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,190
stuff like that with the concept of pull

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,140
request we completely change it your

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,210
contributor just create a frock of your

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,060
project stop working on a new feature

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,100
and so on and say hey I'm done we would

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,900
like to review it and then you can

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,080
comment every line of code you can

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,970
discuss it you can have real description

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
with your contributor and so on and at

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,600
the end when you are done one you can

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,040
continue contribute to on this pull

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,110
request saying well I would prefer that

00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,520
I would prefer test about that and when

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,290
it's done it's integrated main thing and

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,930
this is thought to be very important is

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,870
the contributor Israeli the guys that

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,330
deters a fork and so on when you apply a

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:16,970
patch it's a guys at a price a patch

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:20,240
which is a contributor everyone wants to

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,830
be friends and with the socialization we

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,540
have also social network which are

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,710
connected to that so we can have twitter

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,530
facebook and so on we have users a task

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,719
that subscribe to change on one file or

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,240
follow some pull requests and so on so

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,880
some description some mailing instance

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,620
on it's not one communities anymore your

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,570
perfect is not one communities is a set

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,979
of communities especially for modular

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,410
project where you are several components

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,750
then you may have one communities per

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,580
component and that's no more and maybe

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,200
inside those communities you have

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,180
sub-communities like

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,160
interesting only by this or by following

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,360
the source code or by is tracking the

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:04,160
quality and so on so putting all

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,440
together so all of this is nice we what

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,380
you want to to put all these two

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,350
together and um said that we are already

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,020
working on that you everybody knows that

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,600
we have tools all these tools of all

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:22,570
this attraction tools intimated RVs

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,250
viene eat and so on so this is quite a

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,370
sort of open source paradise so every

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,440
open source developer wants to have this

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,730
kind of platform where everything is

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,600
well integrated and so on so we really

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,730
want to provide a bitter you development

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,700
experience because we know that we have

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,630
some problems with bus system and no we

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:51,280
can we can really push this we suspect

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:55,190
we we want to push the efficiency of

00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,950
develop developers okay and push the

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,630
quality and productivity so this is

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,270
going to happen anyway and this is

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,490
happening right now for example if we

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,530
take the just quite standard

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,260
contribution process we have some

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,930
contributors we have some team members

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,500
while working on the on the code where

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,880
all is let's say synchronize and Justin

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,880
12 so some 12 repository is ground and

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,830
 by everyone so we have this

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,050
notion of pull request which is very

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:31,730
important as a cream on set and everyone

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,710
is able to contribute to the code this

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,410
is very important and then pushed to the

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:39,520
Sun 12 reference and then we have these

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:45,200
tools with continuous integration tool

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:47,600
IAM said that we this bamboo stuff which

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,960
is running we are currently discussing

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,810
with partners such as club is to to be

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,720
able to provide more integration in the

00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,410
cloud another important point and this

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,080
is the station to this afternoon is is

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,530
the quality just squat box

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,870
to be able to get feedback on the code

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:13,040
this is a very important point we want

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:15,860
to push in audible you too so all those

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,120
tools are one main goal is to improve

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,360
the quality of our software it's more as

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,310
one of the grower of open source but all

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,470
the tools we are trying to set up and so

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,870
on is to improve the efficiency of our

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,610
development and to improve the quality

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,770
not only is a quad quality but release

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,500
equality in the large the cut

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:40,100
documentation the project documentation

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,440
and so on the license checking being

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,710
sure that you are not violating any

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,270
license and there is so many open-source

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,340
license it's pretty hard to know which

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,190
one is compatible with the other one and

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,870
so on all the socialization more

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,810
community more people interested

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,840
obviously we will get more request more

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,750
description and you buy this way improve

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,000
your component on your project and the

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,260
fan I pawned and the bottom is being an

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,790
w2 good citizenship being a good citizen

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,370
which means using the other blue to

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,700
world correctly using the right package

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,670
name and so on everything make it a

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,160
pretty beautiful and I quality project

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,660
so we hope to build this new

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,110
infrastructure as soon as possible

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,420
Guillaume already started as a TC and no

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,460
Christoph is continuing this work we are

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,650
starting integrating new tools we have

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,390
description with new companies like

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,840
lobby for the continuous integration

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,840
