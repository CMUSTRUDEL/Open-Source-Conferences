Description: 
	An open source infrastructure supporting software quality assessment at Engineering Group - Daniele Gagliardi, Spago4Q - Engineering Group. Abstract : Engineering Group's Quality Assurance department has developed an infrastructure allowing to monitor the quality of the development processes of software projects and products, which was also needed to achieve the CMMi-DEV lev.3 certification compliance. The infrastructure allows the logical and technical integration of different tools supporting the development and management of software projects, in compliance with the corporate organizational rules, thus granting a high level of flexibility to users, who can choose between open source tools and, if requested, proprietary ones. The cornerstone of this process is Spago4Q, which provides the working groups with the necessary information to trace and develop end-users' requirements, to manage tests and project information, including risks, opportunities, metrics and documents. Moreover, it allows the Quality Assurance department to make its own audits on projects and related management processes. Spago4Q extracts the needed information from the different data sources, integrating them into a consistent meta-model. The speech describes the results obtained through the development of original solutions and the integration of both open source and proprietary products, such as TestLink, Jira, Liferay and Alfresco. The speech will include an overview on the possible improvements in terms of project quality and corporate processes.
