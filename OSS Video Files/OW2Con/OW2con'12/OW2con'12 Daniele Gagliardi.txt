Description: 
	An open source infrastructure supporting software quality assessment at Engineering Group - Daniele Gagliardi, Spago4Q - Engineering Group. Abstract : Engineering Group's Quality Assurance department has developed an infrastructure allowing to monitor the quality of the development processes of software projects and products, which was also needed to achieve the CMMi-DEV lev.3 certification compliance. The infrastructure allows the logical and technical integration of different tools supporting the development and management of software projects, in compliance with the corporate organizational rules, thus granting a high level of flexibility to users, who can choose between open source tools and, if requested, proprietary ones. The cornerstone of this process is Spago4Q, which provides the working groups with the necessary information to trace and develop end-users' requirements, to manage tests and project information, including risks, opportunities, metrics and documents. Moreover, it allows the Quality Assurance department to make its own audits on projects and related management processes. Spago4Q extracts the needed information from the different data sources, integrating them into a consistent meta-model. The speech describes the results obtained through the development of original solutions and the integration of both open source and proprietary products, such as TestLink, Jira, Liferay and Alfresco. The speech will include an overview on the possible improvements in terms of project quality and corporate processes.

danielly galiardi who's going to talk to

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,080
us about Spock oh you I to hold I'm

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,780
Daniella Galiardi spoke of 4q architect

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,130
from engineering group and in my speech

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,920
I would like to talk about an experience

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:24,600
with open source in quality a solution

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,029
based on our spa go for Q in the speech

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,949
I will show you a scenario in our

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,000
company in which I need arose from our

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,600
users and the solution we made and the

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,230
results we gain from our solution and at

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,719
last them i will show you what are doing

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,890
for the future for the evolution of our

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,960
solution ok the overall scenario it has

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,770
to do with the continuous quality

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,870
improvement in engineering project

00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:01,280
growing complex complexity and sides

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,939
need a more attention to quality so

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,790
Engineering's build infrastructure to

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,340
support quality in processes and

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,540
projects this infrastructure was built

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,439
by the Quality Assurance Department and

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:22,950
research and innovation department and

00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:25,890
engineering to have chosen independent

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,729
third-party criterion to validate the

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,420
quality in this process in projects

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:35,729
specifically the CMMI for development

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:45,090
certification engineering is at level 3

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:48,689
and iso 9001 in this infrastructure as a

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,280
lot of tools supporting the application

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,310
lifecycle management and project

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,350
management these infrastructure is

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,130
compliant to cooperate information

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,040
systems and rules and the access to

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,100
various tools is role-based us access

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,479
the profiling information retrieved for

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,819
company systems and

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,640
the main users of our infrastructural

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,900
specifically project managers and

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,940
political and Saudi tours but also

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,330
customers because these infrastructure

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,930
is available also to outside the

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,959
corporate the cooperating network and

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:34,329
also obviously external consultants that

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:39,620
collaborate with engineering projects

00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:42,170
which tools we built a corporate project

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,640
portal based on liferay and alfresco and

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,329
in this property we developed several

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:55,930
applications several portraits to manage

00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:58,579
for example the project risks also

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,530
project matrix based on function point

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:06,859
and men they peer reviews the

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,220
documentation management and and other

00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:14,599
and other features for the application

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:18,440
lifecycle management we put on distance

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,609
of atlassian jira to manage requirements

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,030
bugs project issues and tasks of the

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:28,160
people involved in the projects

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,319
attraction JIRA is used also to track

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,319
down the hood it's the quality audits

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,200
and the remarks by the Quality Assurance

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,200
Department specific configuration of

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:45,139
JIRA is used for this specific task and

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:48,019
last for the test management we used we

00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:51,260
use test link for the integration

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:55,040
between zero and toslink we developed a

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:59,780
plug-in that let project managers to

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:03,919
bind test cases in tesla inca with

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,349
requirements in JIRA okay this is the

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,310
big picture we can see all the tools of

00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:13,510
our quality infrastructure with JIRA

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,510
communicating with test link

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:21,459
the corporate systems for authentication

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:26,620
and authorization and also we can see on

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:30,400
the right the project portal for the

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,910
project management in the upper left

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,490
corner there is place for a project

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,650
planning tool that should be

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,840
corporate-wide we are investigating to

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:46,750
you to integrate a project planning tool

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,240
available to all users web based them

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:56,230
and so on okay so far so good but when

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,810
our users started to use this quality

00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:05,950
infrastructure soon a lot of questions

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:09,370
arose for example the requirement test

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,610
coverage or start statistics for service

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,670
level agreement or report for project

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:24,390
review meetings risk management and so

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:28,330
on and sadly a lot of users when they

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:32,500
saw that they cannot have a unified view

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:36,700
this is the problem simply decided to

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:39,790
use its own tools that may tool often

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,419
they use spreadsheet as a personal that

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,669
visa and also a personal business

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:50,470
intelligence business project

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:53,470
intelligence tool the problem is is this

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,250
the need a lack of a unified view we

00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,480
have a lot several tools and every and

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,700
each tool as its own the data source and

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,680
this lead to some problem because

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,290
requirements are separated from this

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,830
case profiling information around

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:15,780
several that visa there is a lack of

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,970
report automation users that use these

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,610
infrastructure had to attract from the

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,650
different tools information and then

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:29,460
build themselves report in a unit

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,520
manner the flexibility to have different

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,590
several tools open source tools

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,419
sacrifice the control over the

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,880
information that we can obtain by these

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:44,460
tools and there is the concrete risk

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,960
that people have been doing the company

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,229
infrastructure in faro of self-made

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,600
solutions as I told you before this lead

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,520
to three problems three great problems

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,010
the scattering of project information

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,949
inside the single project a project

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,479
manager as a lot of source of

00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:09,470
information but also scattering at

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,090
lavell of company we cannot build a

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,880
repository of lessons learned for

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:19,260
improving quality in the future projects

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:23,130
and also a lot but not least a lot of

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:29,099
work thrown away all the work we have

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:33,810
done to build infrastructure okay the

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:36,030
solution the solution we made is based

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,080
on Spago you as you can see in this

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:43,380
schema Spago for Q is in the center and

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,949
collect information from the different

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,610
tools informations about this cases in

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:53,010
test link informations about

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:57,030
requirements task bugs and formations

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,940
are typically time informations status

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,090
informations and so on and quality

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,010
audits also stored in the trash and JIRA

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:10,880
and informations from project portals

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:15,389
about statistics on documentation

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:18,180
production risks estimations and other

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:21,180
useful informations we can collect also

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,900
information from source code

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,990
repositories but today project manager

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,139
prefers to remain at lavell that are

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,039
highly well and

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:40,250
each project group each project

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:44,360
developer use its own tools okay here we

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,630
can see samples of analysis we have

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,990
gained with these solutions Spago 4q

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,940
offers to project managers indicators on

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:58,970
test coverage very important and also

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:03,199
indicators on time typically average

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,500
resolution time average time in status

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:08,870
kane and project matrix training

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,290
documentation productions here is

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,699
another not exhaustive list and spa go

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:18,380
for q offers to Quality Assurance

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:22,699
auditors statistics on audit and ready

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,730
to use statistics that k they they can

00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:28,040
use in six more reports typically

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,320
depressed by Engineering's Board of

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Directors and also quality

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,870
infrastructure managers can have

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,740
information on the trend of

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:42,680
documentation growth storage physical

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,760
storage is a it's a it's an important

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,339
thing to to take in account because we

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,380
here we need space and also the

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,910
unsuitable use of the infrastructure for

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,399
the same reason and often we we will see

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:02,350
in example users tend to use the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:07,100
infrastructure for personal backup tool

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:12,560
some example of the reports we we made a

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:15,140
unified dashboard this is the the entry

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,959
point of the analysis that Spago 4q

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,560
offers and in this unified dashboards we

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,000
have informations on from the different

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,370
tools risks from projects portal and

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,930
tasks and issues and requirements and

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:37,240
bugs from Russian zero and also matrix

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:40,950
again from project portals and

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,079
information and documents

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:48,310
the unified dashboard has also helped

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:52,320
online to help users to interpret them

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:55,560
to read correctly the informations and

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,010
also a jira dashboard with a lot of

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:04,240
indicators about issues requirements

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:08,680
tasks you can see different indicators a

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,769
different graph some chart is navigable

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,690
and you can for example drill down from

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:18,880
the requirements in JIRA to the details

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,690
of the test k is bound to each

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,040
requirement and that indicator is a is

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,630
navigable from there we can have a

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,699
rapport with the list of requirements

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,089
and for each requirements all the

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:36,399
requirements on JIRA all the test case

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:40,510
in test links bound to that requirement

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,100
and from this project manager can build

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,149
the documentation to present the

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,880
customers for example of the test case

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:53,230
bound to each requirement of the project

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:57,040
okay dashboards on project risks reports

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,149
on the documentation trend and also the

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,920
possibility to have informations who

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:10,060
accesses why which document also request

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,180
from our project manager and here we can

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,310
see the analysis that infrastructure

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:21,810
monitoring offers we can see that binary

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:25,990
documents generic binary documents okay

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:30,130
take a lot of space with the query by

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:34,690
example feature we can individuate the

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:37,209
the single documented other than that as

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,010
there is this feature here we can see

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:45,130
that in the in the first position of

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,149
storage occupation we see an archival

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:51,910
PST that typically is a backup of

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:52,680
Microsoft Outlook personal email okay

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,490
again

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,010
project report for sorry reports for

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,180
review project review meetings and the

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:09,570
possibility to have passin snapshots and

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:13,080
ok and reports for quality audits ok all

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:16,649
these things our users that saw these

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:20,040
resolutions were satisfied and as a last

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:23,430
question ok they are happy but they want

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,220
to know if they can also use their

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,610
favorite project intelligence tool the

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,649
spreadsheet of course because the

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,660
reports the content reports are

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:40,290
exportable with several formats for

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:45,870
example Microsoft Excel i discovered

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:49,800
that people use this tool for specific

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:53,790
reports and statistics and so on what's

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:58,040
under the hood quickly we have a spa go

00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:02,459
for to date aroused feed by fed by in

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,490
tallinn the ETL process and that collect

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:10,380
information from the data source of our

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:14,040
tools and important there is a an

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,580
authentication module that build the

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,959
dynamic security context so the users

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,850
that enters in the two can see only

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,190
informations about his own projects or

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,800
his own area quality orders with

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:34,100
auditors will see all information about

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:40,709
quality auditing remarks and so on and

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:42,420
what we used of course we had to be we

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,480
had designed data warehouse and the

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:49,170
prophet of atl process we have developed

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,630
reports with burt and cubes with JP

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,970
water for the dynamic security context

00:14:53,630 --> 00:15:00,800
we had to implement our Spago bi

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,630
interface specific for these this task

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,150
taking account that information

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:10,710
providing information are in company

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:12,480
legacy systems so there is no standard

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,870
tool to record to recover these

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:21,570
informations and all integrated together

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:24,930
inside Spock 4q the future enhancing of

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,330
course reports and kpi building KPI for

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,630
a specific juror project that we use to

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:33,990
collect informations from our users to

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:36,420
enhance the quality infrastructures and

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,860
the integration of the corporate why the

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:43,050
project planning tool with the goal to

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,970
have a complete project intelligence

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,970
