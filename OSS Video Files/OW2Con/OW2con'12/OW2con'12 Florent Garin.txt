	DocDokuPLM: Product Structure - Digital MockUp visualization using HTML5 - Florent Garin, DocDoku
AbtsractÂ : DocDokuPLM (Product Lifecycle Management) is a middleware solutions aim at managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its conception to its disposal through the manufacturing stage. PLM systems involve the whole enterprise, they gather at a central point data, business processes and people. They expose backbone services for the company, their partners and their subcontrators thus we design our PLM with the extended enterprise concept in mind. On the technical part we made the decision to not rely on any native code on the client side all the features must be accessible through a regular web browser. If that seems quite obvious nowadays and doesn't represent a big challenge for the "Document Management", "Product Configuration", "Change Management" or "Bill of Materials" modules that tends to be far more complex when developing the data visualization of the product structure. This session will focus on how we implemented the visualization and the manipulation of the Digital MockUp (DMU) using HTML5 technologies. We'll explain the difficulties we encountered and also the various optimizations we made in order to render a model with thousands part. And obviously we'll show a real demonstration !
