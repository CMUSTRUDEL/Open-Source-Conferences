Thank You Cedric my name is odg boos all

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,760
welcome as a community coordinator I

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,769
would like to say a few words first a

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,809
world work wall warm welcome to our

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:18,600
community members we have new in Paris

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,420
especially for our friends from China I

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,420
know there are also friends from Eastern

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,680
Europe and northern Europe we have

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:34,800
members as you know from South America

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:39,329
form me medium medium America and North

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,960
America too so it's a vast family as we

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,030
can say and to just to talk a few words

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
about the news in France I don't know if

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,590
you followed the latest family problems

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,370
that we have on the right party side the

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,280
UMP party which is which was founded by

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,359
an AGP as now a competition inside his

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,820
own path party and the shoes for name

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:10,049
just to illustrate the renewal of the

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,090
UMP are UMP name which makes ramp in

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,900
English which probably not a good choice

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,049
for those of you know the ramp is the

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,580
real part of the birds back the copy

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,340
i'll say so choosing a project name is

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,180
not often I easy as you can see and with

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,430
0 W we can help you we can help the

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,490
majority of the projects European

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,619
projects and not only to choose the

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,439
right name for international challenges

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,619
they have to solve but also during all

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,189
the project lifecycle so I'm pleased to

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:53,509
welcome our panel this morning we try to

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,509
avoid that choice together and to

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,240
and talk a little bit about the new open

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,909
source challenges they are always been

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,179
so many challenges in open source

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:09,500
software as you know and just to mention

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:11,390
a few cloud computing open data social

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,640
media application as we've heard this

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,420
morning are becoming more and more

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,569
important so I'm glad to present you our

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,860
this morning experts they together will

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:27,170
check open source software can establish

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,590
standards but also innovation and

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,410
sovereignty which are the three main

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,860
focus for the moment I think so let's

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:38,720
begin maybe with Patrick buttocks doc

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,470
this morning you you presented the god

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,829
wot it's important to know what exactly

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,579
means collaborative innovation at the

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:52,840
moment how do you see this collaboration

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:58,819
called collective innovation is it

00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,099
investing in R&D maybe several rd yeah

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:04,910
the fact that we can share with the

00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:08,989
community some some development and some

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,829
innovation it it bring efficiency from

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:16,459
from the cost perspective because we can

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:19,220
bring knowledge together and we will

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,500
never be able to a form such a large

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,139
community to work together you know if

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,500
we were in in in an exclusive and

00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:32,180
popularity type of environment so the

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:35,480
fact that with an open community you can

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,810
share commonalities is one thing but you

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,840
can share knowledge and you can bring on

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,180
that there's knowledge innovation we

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,000
which could differentiate you as a

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,940
company which is which is quite an

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,739
interesting model in a sense because at

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,090
the end of the day as a company you need

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,220
to differentiate yourself from your

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,220
competition but the fact that you can

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,430
use some commonalities with your own

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,039
competitor potentially mean that there

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,520
is still the last mile in terms of

00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,880
innovation that you need to own in a

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:13,840
but at least you can share something

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,610
with a larger community and it's it's

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,709
not easy to to to integrate that in the

00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:25,360
DNA of a company you know so it's why

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm I'm from the very beginning defining

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,650
as part of them the DNA the cloud cloud

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,710
what DNA the the the fact that we need

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,360
to give and take from the community so

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,310
if you don't give you not part of the

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,320
community and you will not stay longer

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,800
in that community will be rejected which

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,670
is normal in sense thank you Mark they

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,640
tell you you know that OSS community are

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:55,810
now working on the projects on a new

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,320
rhythm probably 24-7 rhythm so what is

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,480
your point regarding open shows social

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,590
innovation do you see more and more open

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,230
source projects and innovation there

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,730
definitely if we look at that the kinds

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,620
of collaboration that we're saying and

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:16,840
the kinds of projects that we see being

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,630
developed for example we started off

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,250
just with OpenSocial we started off with

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,660
Apache shindig right this was really a

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,090
reference framework that was picked up

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,000
by lots and lots of folks around the

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,830
world and started building these social

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,960
platforms in this social middleware and

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,450
that led to a realization that there

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,210
were gaps and and and things that needed

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,430
to be filled and so other projects came

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,770
in along the way like Apache rave which

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,870
would just pick that up so we see you

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,000
know this this ability to build on top

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,490
of things that have been there you know

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,200
in regarding I think to some of the

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,480
points earlier about contributing and

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,880
contributing back and and having

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,820
standards you know that really raises

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,730
the the level of innovation right if you

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,470
think about having standards in place

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,660
that that are built on open source and

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,850
having this open platform you know it

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,800
defines where you go off and compete and

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,500
it defines where that differentiation is

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,210
for example in OpenSocial you know as a

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,330
component model where you want to really

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,340
compete I mean yet you know okay not

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,249
really what you want to compete on is

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,749
the things you can do

00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,399
you with that social data and you want

00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:24,139
to make that social data available

00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,249
because that's where that secret sauce

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,609
is all right that's what's going to

00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:29,929
differentiate you as a platform in some

00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:32,179
of that so I think there's a tremendous

00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,769
amount of innovation happening I think

00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:36,619
open source and open standards actually

00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,899
facilitate that so it's interesting to

00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:41,119
have Alfonso's opinion about this

00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,549
because Microsoft is a large company

00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:45,709
they could stay with their own labs

00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:48,109
everywhere in the world working on the

00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:51,139
innovation or around the clock why

00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:53,059
innovate with open source project when

00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,309
you have a name like Microsoft what is

00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:58,309
the point is it to get more scalable

00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:00,619
solution to a different solution well we

00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:02,689
think that the world is diverse first of

00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:06,349
all so many customers across the planet

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:08,389
use either open source based technology

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,459
and non or persons based technology they

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,529
can be from Microsoft from other

00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:13,909
companies so first of all it's a great

00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,399
recognition of the fact that our

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:18,619
customers are mixing technologies and

00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,039
the right solutions are probably based

00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:22,969
on mixed solutions I mean even Microsoft

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,949
doesn't have one hundred percent

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:27,709
Microsoft Technology within the company

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,889
so its first of all we surprised by that

00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,829
then we we thought it was also good for

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,959
both communities I mean the open source

00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:38,689
world on one side and our company on the

00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,219
other side to jointly work too so to

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,589
collaborate on some specific

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:44,719
technologies I'm not saying we're gonna

00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:48,259
collaborate on everything it will depend

00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:50,449
on marketing it will depend on market

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,999
demand will depend on customers but

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,369
we've been now working in for several

00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:59,209
years on different technologies and with

00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:01,549
I think successful results have many

00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,489
examples whether it's on the cloud space

00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:07,699
on the private or on-premises if you

00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:09,469
wish information systems so that that

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,089
modal is really working and as you may

00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,349
know we don't have one specific team

00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,689
which is called Microsoft open

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,429
technologies which is only working with

00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,889
communities with open source communities

00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,509
and producing codes with those dvds and

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,709
of course producing that codeine

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,169
responsible mode okay thank you Elliot L

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,460
you are representing the users here your

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,729
head

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,070
of the e-government unit in Lebanon so

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,649
what's your interest view of the main

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,050
benefits for your work group and for

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:44,169
your government to to use open source

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:47,380
software and technologies thank you the

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:51,190
government means three main things first

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,080
one is citizen to government which is

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,300
the relationship between the citizen and

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,010
the administration second one is

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,050
government-to-government how information

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,870
could be exchanged between different

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,410
administration's and the third one the

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:10,270
automation of administration and ten

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:12,760
internally we started a strategic

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,190
project for the e-government about a

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,760
government portal and I will say more

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:23,050
about that tomorrow with open source

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,470
platform for us and for I think all

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,170
administration's open source is is an

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,420
option we have different options of

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,510
solutions in the market open source

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:38,560
becomes an option for any solution for

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:41,800
any project I think there are two

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,339
challenges for open sources as different

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,260
other solutions the first one is

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,810
interoperability any solutions in the

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,060
market including o pessoal should be

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,850
interoperable with different other

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,980
solutions we cannot have one solution

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,920
for all administration's or for all

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,010
enterprises in the world then there are

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,920
a lot of solutions they should be

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,000
interoperable the second one from our

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,420
perspective is the end-to-end security

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,190
any requests from the citizen coming to

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,310
the administration and come back to the

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,860
citizen should be completely secure

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,660
based on privacy based on

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,010
confidentiality and based on the

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,620
integrity of information for that these

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,970
two points are very important for us I

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,230
don't know if there are some

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,090
certifications or some

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,030
International Organization organizations

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,860
with which can guarantee that this open

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,050
source component or this open source

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,000
solutions is secured and it could be

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,430
interoperable with different other

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,520
solution this is a real two challenges

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,950
for us for the future when this project

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,220
will be deployed yes thank you and add

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,790
value to works on that of course maybe

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,070
one more world about your organization

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,460
through open source software but you try

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:09,070
to improve the collective efficiency of

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,580
the each ministry or what is exactly the

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:19,410
point there we have our first experience

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:22,540
in open source and we are promoting with

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:26,920
with our partners the local market is

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:30,190
more service oriented and this will be

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,710
an opportunity because open source it's

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,290
more service oriented rather than

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,760
products oriental we are promoting that

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,790
and in the

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,160
in the first in the software market and

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,160
then for the administration's but we

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,560
still have a clear message we are not

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,470
imposing for administration's the open

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,920
source solution this is one option for

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,020
with other options okay thanks Jamal car

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,010
do you see open-source software as a

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,110
catalyst for innovation now yeah I mean

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,430
absolutely it's everything that we do is

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,620
a company at Hortonworks is all about

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,030
open source right so every line of code

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,220
that we create goes back into the

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,990
community so we believe in the community

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,750
as really kind of an engine of

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,850
innovation right if you look at the path

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,380
at least a you know what we represent in

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,030
terms of Hadoop its is probably one of

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,790
the fastest growing open-source projects

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,380
we've seen the rated innovation over the

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,090
past year and a half as the community

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,450
has grown and as companies has started

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,710
to adopt that it's just it's remarkable

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,170
you know we have virgin one of Hadoop

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,690
was released in January of this year and

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,420
we'll see version 2 of a noob come out

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,220
in in January of 2013 general

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,740
availability and that really couldn't

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,690
have been done was a small companies

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,880
such as ours and you know we're a

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,680
hundred and fifty or so people you know

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,660
we can build software fairly quickly we

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,490
have some great expertise but we have

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,650
this community of developers who are

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,120
also innovating with us and it's not

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,880
just innovation on the forefront in

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,950
terms of what's going into the software

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,360
or how it works or you know kind of

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,720
where are the areas where we're

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,610
expanding how it works it's around

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,680
testing the software as well it's about

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,590
making it enterprise-grade making it

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,510
reliable making it stable because an

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:18,380
open source project in itself is only

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:22,250
going to go so far as a group of guys in

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,950
a garage it really requires a larger

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,450
ecosystem of developers and it extends

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,200
well beyond just the innovation side

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,540
there's a concept and open source around

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,900
a balance of innovation and stability

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,480
and early on and in a software cycle

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,070
it's this rapid rate of innovation we're

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,110
really trying to make stuff great great

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,900
great because early adopters the

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,490
software can adopt things they can

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,830
actually deal with problems they have

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,620
developers who can go ahead and fix

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,510
things and they'll

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,550
they can take part in that community but

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,190
at some point if the enterprise is going

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,779
to adopt software it absolutely needs to

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,450
be stable and needs to heavy have high

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,490
availability it needs to be secure it

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,779
needs to have all the management

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,930
consoles and tools that you would have

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:09,210
around that and what happens is the the

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,520
innovation moves from being kind of

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,890
let's let's work on the core of what

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,620
things are to work around the ecosystem

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,150
what what a open source project is in

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,190
the middle case in my head is really

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,770
around Hadoop so having innovation is

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,260
absolutely key to all of this so one of

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,300
Alton works challenge at the moment

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,640
would be not only to provide the

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,720
industrial tools but end-to-end service

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,160
to the customers yes I mean if that's a

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,200
challenge of any company who sells

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,960
software its intent service and you know

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,180
quite honestly we are I'm sorry I'm

00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,640
speaking just about Hortonworks but in a

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,800
pure open source model where it's not

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,260
the open core it's not freemium it's not

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,550
that you know we develop software and

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,710
give it back to the community every

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,870
single line of code we give is given

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,940
back to everybody we sell support and

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,860
services only so it's definitely end to

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,529
end because we need to make sure that

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,959
Hadoop is being adopted by every

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,279
organization in the world and it hooves

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,570
us to make sure that they're going to be

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,610
successful with it and so we're going to

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,260
partner with people like Microsoft to

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,779
actually make sure that big data in

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,880
Hadoop is used in every organization on

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,770
the planet and they're fantastic partner

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,570
of ours because they can provide that

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,360
end-to-end support that end-to-end

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:25,740
visibility into an enterprise to make

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,070
really Hadoop in my case successful okay

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,920
thank you Alexander Persky maybe you're

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:35,490
working with government IT managers with

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,180
innovation managers in companies small

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,600
medium large companies how do you see

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,020
them regarding the choice of open-source

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:50,279
technology and how do you help them plan

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:54,270
new services also we mainly work with

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:57,810
large organizations and many in this

00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,560
large organization with the with the

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:06,300
public administrations

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,790
the thing that we see is that in Europe

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:15,060
but not only in Europe but first in

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:19,350
Europe things change in France we have a

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:22,410
government was was adopted Oh new it's

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,740
not really a low but it's what we got in

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:30,210
French circulaire it's a kind of law so

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,940
the Prime Minister I signed this kind of

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:36,810
flow a circular asking to all

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:40,290
administration's to run more open source

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:46,290
software and why he asked that he asked

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:49,380
that because he has asked to his team to

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:54,530
see what the government has done with

00:16:49,380 --> 00:17:01,380
open source from the last 10 years and

00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:06,780
the government as so that using open

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:10,650
source is very cost-effective it works

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:15,000
almost as the same as the preparatory

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:19,560
software and it's better for our own

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,850
economy our own jobs and so he said okay

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,400
so it's almost as good it goes less it

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,590
good for us so let's go we need to do

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,430
more open source that's the first time

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:36,420
in France you have a public decision

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:39,060
about open source at this level is it

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,840
based on benchmark Realty yeah this is

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,940
exactly what what is mentioned in this

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,950
circular in this kind of flow they said

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,270
okay we have done a lot of benchmark

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:53,130
since 10 years and now we know that

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,640
that's the point there is no more debate

00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,160
in France in governments about open

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,290
source cost less than proprietary

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,000
software and it's better so let's go we

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,360
need to do more and to do more open

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,990
source software in so that's an option

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,860
but today it's almost the best option if

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,260
you are large organization this is

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,620
he said the prime minister in France

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,240
jamaka oh and so he said okay we did we

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,820
need to do more open source offer and

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,549
for that we knew we need to know at

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,130
which level we do open source of well so

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,679
for that we need specific contract

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:32,260
dedicated to open source which is very

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,890
good because in fact if you do large

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,440
contract only big providers are able to

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,870
answer to the large contracts and of

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,990
course our sm is small and medium

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,880
businesses are not able to answer to

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,130
this last contract so that's not good

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,470
for small companies because today the

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,140
open source market is done by small and

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,940
very innovative company and so they will

00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:01,270
build very specific contract to have new

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:05,169
provider growing up which is pretty good

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:08,230
for all the community of open source but

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:10,870
France that has not made the specific

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,490
choice in Europe if you take the example

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:19,360
of Italia Italia has made in on public

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:22,059
tender regulation the obligation to ask

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,100
open source software and if you don't

00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,640
find an open source software you have to

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,679
develop them to develop it and if if the

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,650
cost to develop this open source

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,950
software is more than to choose a

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:39,309
proprietor fur it is only in this last

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,880
case that you have the right in italia

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:46,030
to use proprietary software but that's

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,900
not all in Europe for example if you

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,720
take the example of grip retain united

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,870
kingdom what the government said they

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,340
said ok we want you mentioned the

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,490
question and the subject of

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,309
interoperability but under this issue

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,210
there are many other issue and one of

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:11,500
the big one is about is the standards

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:17,770
are official standards we vote without

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:20,460
any fee to use the standards or do you

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,460
think that industrial standard we've

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,780
fair and reasonable price to use the

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,970
stand

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,770
is a standard and the UK government as

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:36,660
officially answer to this question they

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:40,020
said we don't want to use what they call

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,780
fair and reasonable standard price than

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,740
that we will not choose any more this

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:51,630
kind of standards Oh Prince to not only

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:55,290
open standard birds we've no restricted

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,960
fee okay this is really important and

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,270
what the UK government said we know that

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,550
today the market is not exactly at the

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,830
same level especially for example for

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:09,780
dekstop they mentioned the borough fees

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:13,320
in front of microsoft office but they

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,260
say we accept that and we need to accept

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,790
that to change the market this is what

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,830
the UK government decided and Germany

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,990
also has decided many things in north of

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,350
Europe also in federal government in the

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,330
u.s. also and in China or so there are a

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,000
lot of initiative I just came back I was

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,400
in China in September and there are so

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
many thing happens there so the world of

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,030
public administration change globally

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,270
Thank You Alexander you made the

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,910
transition yourself throughout the next

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:50,400
subject which is osm standardization so

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,470
when the community is adopting a project

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,670
we can say it's becoming a standout at

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:59,490
the moment Eliot a are you you know that

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,520
there are is there is a lot of talk at

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,630
the moment about data compliance about

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:14,510
data localization also and sovereignty

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:17,010
what is your take on this it's about the

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:20,400
data exchange between different

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,980
administrations we are working on

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,940
interoperability framework on different

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,440
levels of compliance between the fund

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,120
administration the first one is the

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,670
technical level based on open standards

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,210
the first one and the most important one

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,510
the semantic level based on how data

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,680
should be exchanged between

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:49,100
administration's who is done over the

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:53,070
owner of the data and who is willing to

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:55,250
receive this data and the third one the

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:01,190
third level is the organization level

00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:04,860
how that should be structured and

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,870
organized in order to have different

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,840
information based on the initial

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:13,440
procedures dedicated due to the end user

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,080
which is the citizen yes the the end

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,690
user in your case is not only d exactly

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,960
okay the sort of citizens all over the

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,860
world wish for more transparency they

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:30,000
wish also especially on public expenses

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:32,970
want to know what is pinned and where do

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,130
you see those initiative as a good

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,480
measure to decrease maybe your throats

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:43,830
or corruption yes egovernment in itself

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,620
is very important mean against

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,710
corruption because when the citizen is

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,620
in one side and the civil servant and

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,440
the another side then we should reduce

00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:00,720
the corruption which is very very

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:04,650
important data compliance is very

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:08,010
important because when we when a citizen

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:10,380
start a procedure he has to bring some

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:16,220
documents and each of those documents

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,220
could be also a procedure then he has to

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,520
perform different transactions with with

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,980
the administration the data exchange is

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,000
very important with a division we have

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:32,580
that the citizen can start a transaction

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,970
without any document that added

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,980
administration itself as a black box

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:40,380
should get those information from

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,690
different internal administration it's a

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,999
big challenges it's a vision for maybe

00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,939
five years in the future but

00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:49,589
it's very important for the

00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:52,049
simplification of procedures from the

00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:54,149
citizen perspective yes at this point of

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,849
the debate I think mark the it's

00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:59,849
interesting to see how to see the impact

00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:02,219
of social networks on the society in

00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:06,659
fact it social networks are revealing

00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:10,669
changes to the people and not only 2i t

00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:13,589
users so with new turkel capabilities

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,039
petabyte of storage on the cloud how do

00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:22,939
you see what can we expect from open

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:25,709
social media I think if we if we look at

00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:28,139
things that are happening specifically

00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:30,119
within the enterprise for example a lot

00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:31,889
of those are going to start to emulate

00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:35,129
many of the trends that we see in the

00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:38,699
consumer world so if we think about in

00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:40,739
the consumer world how your you're being

00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:43,349
targeted for very specific information

00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:46,109
right and in in the consumer space this

00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:47,759
is so they can sell you something but if

00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:50,189
we look at some of those things in the

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,349
enterprise world and say this is the

00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:55,259
same sort of technology is the same sort

00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:57,779
of way to analyze the social information

00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,749
that's contained inside of the big data

00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:02,309
inside your graph and use that to target

00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:03,809
information that might be relevant to

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,209
the things that you need to do to get

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:08,549
done on a daily basis that's very

00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:10,019
important that's very powerful and so if

00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,839
we can if we can understand those

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,699
patterns of how you're connected to

00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,259
people of the things that you're doing

00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:20,039
of the things that are interesting to

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,509
you from a perspective of a business of

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,639
what you need to get your job done and

00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:26,339
then apply those same technologies to

00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:27,779
deliver that information to you then

00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,639
we'll say great you know greater

00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,109
efficiencies and I think that's some of

00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:33,239
the ways we're seeing the trends move

00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:36,079
some of the ways we can see Big Data

00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:38,639
come into play of being able to target

00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,319
intelligently information directly to a

00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,839
user typically through an activity

00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,159
stream or a feed or something like that

00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,129
yes you mentioned their co-worker

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,169
recognition it's important looking at

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:51,910
Big Data a big social data but what

00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,010
really what will be the impact on

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,710
itions for instance so let's take an

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,840
example of you know if I'm looking for

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,510
information I do a search if I'm if I'm

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:06,010
a CIO and I search for you know an

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,480
analyst or if I am you know a CFO and I

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,190
look for analysts that the kind of

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,930
information i might get back would be

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,240
very different one case i might get a

00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,250
set of financial reports or financial

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,230
information back in another i might get

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:20,080
a set of Gartner Forrester reports back

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,370
so that's contextual based on who I am

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,410
in the organization and who I'm

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,120
connected to if the people that I'm

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:28,210
looking at where the people that I'm

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,460
following have read the Forester reports

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,310
that's probably more relevant to me then

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:37,030
somebody you know something else you

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:38,590
know a CIO who's who's read the

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,420
financial reports are the economist

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,480
right so that's sort of targeting and

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,940
awareness of what I'm doing and who I am

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,460
and what I'm connected to as well as the

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,200
connections and what they're doing that

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,510
can be used in those sorts of situations

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,090
that's very very powerful interesting

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,620
thank you Patrick you mentioned iCloud

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,200
wats is about infrastructure as a

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,030
service but over the infrastructure will

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,770
you provide multi-tenant solution like

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:08,590
such solutions there we we aim to

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:10,900
provide the infrastructure for this type

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,800
of application and others which means

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:17,920
that of course we need to be secure you

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:23,320
need to be flexible you need to be you

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:26,110
know able to to scale up and out without

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,710
any constraint to the application layer

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:32,800
you just need to to provide the right

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,240
api and it's why through standardization

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,390
it's absolutely key because when you

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,620
develop that level at that layer you

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,120
need to understand how you could

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,670
leverage the infrastructure you're

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,530
running on you know in order to to get

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,420
better efficiency from an application

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,040
standpoint because you actually to write

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,320
to deliver the right information to the

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,540
right people at the right time you need

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,740
to have everything work working well

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:59,230
together and from so maybe a one word on

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,070
windows a zero as a public cloud you

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,450
have also solution which

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:07,399
bi bread cloud or private cloud when is

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,220
it only security issues that would be

00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,950
due to that will and choose the right

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:18,580
place for the cursor well the thing is

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,580
it's a complex decision making process

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,389
before we move on that I want to answer

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,090
some of things that examine mentioned

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:29,090
because that seems like a 10 year old

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,880
debate i mean the the fact that you you

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,710
you sailed one hand you should be

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,320
proprietary you should be open sores

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,419
this is bad and this is and this is good

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,330
that thing has completely change i mean

00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:44,379
the world has completely changed lexon

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,700
took lots of examples of things were or

00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:48,980
administration's approach group went to

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,080
open source by imposing it the fact that

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,110
it opens or is not good of bad i think

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,960
it's okay it depends on many factors i

00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:59,809
have lots of examples of Iceland Germany

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,179
Spain France as well administrations

00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:04,850
they have switched back from oppressors

00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:07,970
to some other systems and I'm not saying

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,559
it's good either it depends on many many

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,169
factors and as you mentioned there are

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,840
lots of benchmarks some showing good on

00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:16,220
one side and Balan lsm so I don't think

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,480
that is a debate I think the debate is

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,460
about standards it's about

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,500
interoperability I'm absolutely with you

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,080
it's all about giving choice to

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,629
customers what customers want is not to

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,669
go one way what they want to be is be

00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:31,700
able to go back and change and put

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:34,100
pressure on their vendors so they can

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,149
switch back anytime they want for any

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,379
reason they have that reason might be

00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:42,919
financial that reason might be because

00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:46,399
the strategic the technology the

00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,710
strategy has changed so that depends

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,629
only on the under customer so you're you

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,629
were dumped your back to your question

00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:55,549
about what kind of clouds right go for I

00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:57,409
think it depends also on that on some

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:00,679
specific cases you will be willing to

00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:04,340
own your data for any reason that might

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,470
be because of legal sense they could be

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,450
because of financial aspects they can be

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,080
because you don't trust people you don't

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,640
have enough guarantee on your van

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,529
from your vendors and the fact that they

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,690
will really take care of your earlier

00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:19,029
data not necessary meaning that you will

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,760
do better but at least at your decision

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:23,529
so the debate between private cloud and

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,630
public club it's also about

00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:27,789
interoperability because the good way

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,909
for you to have a solution which will

00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:32,769
match all your euro constraints will be

00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:35,919
to have the choice of moving your

00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:38,590
applications your data from your private

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,899
cloud either even if it's hosted or not

00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,210
but it's your day your private cloud and

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,769
move that to another public cloud

00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:48,309
because in some specific cases you will

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:51,340
be earning money or whatever so that

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:52,600
interoperability debate is also very

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,059
important in that in that dimension

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,309
sorry for my very wrong response but I

00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,649
think that that's really the point in a

00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:03,570
probability so the conclusion for maybe

00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:06,760
Patrick stark would be becoming a

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,429
provider of service provider in fact you

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:13,120
have to have both or even the three

00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:17,590
solution in fact exactly we don't need

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,289
to be dogmatic don't domitus listen with

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,970
very pragmatic you have a problem to fix

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:23,950
you need to bring value to your

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,080
customers then the question is how to

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:30,519
bring the highest value for money you

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,769
know so of course the there's diversity

00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,690
diversity from a technology standpoint

00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:38,620
there is diversity for the culture

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:41,110
standpoint so what is important is the

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:45,700
fact that you can get all these pieces

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:50,110
from the puzzle work together so the

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:52,870
entire pie ability the stand out there

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:56,860
to be let's say to be sure that at the

00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,960
end you get the best and the best value

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,570
for the money you're investing you so

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,620
I'm personally convinced that in our

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:08,380
case of course on our environment we we

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,919
have solution coming from different

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:15,970
suppliers the choice we have made and I

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,480
explained earlier was to run our plant

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,120
in

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,290
sense to run our plant we made some

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,100
choice but phone app from an end user

00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:29,919
standpoint we will have on our platform

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,470
multiple environment and the user the

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,760
customer we pick up the whiny things you

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:39,429
can get the the best value for know so

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,280
we know sovereignty is important because

00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:46,870
we had two projects or in drought in

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:48,970
France now or at least two at the moment

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,460
so I and sovereignty relies on on

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:54,280
standards to avoid the vengers locking

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:59,020
but it isn't innovation always

00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:03,000
challenging this quest in fact maybe bar

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:07,390
mark would say something but that

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,340
innovation is and standards say chase in

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:15,129
fact the innovation is always in front

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:20,290
so so so so I think that that you can

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:23,859
have standards and an open source and

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:28,149
innovation all work well together one of

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:31,480
the things that we did specifically with

00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:34,119
OpenSocial is we we changed that the

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,639
model of how the standards developed to

00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,629
follow more of an open source model and

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,450
it was done specifically for fostering

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,159
that innovation and we try to when

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,350
somebody wants to propose something to

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,590
the standard and change the standard we

00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,510
typically require a prototype then we

00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,490
encourage that prototype to be done in

00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,590
one of the open source projects that i

00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,890
mentioned and the reason we do that is

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:02,200
so that you can demonstrate that what

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:05,710
you're trying to do and change the

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,640
standard can in fact be done and done in

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,500
a practical way and it's available at

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,950
the time it goes into the standard in

00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,290
open source and i think we've seen a lot

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,500
of innovation and we try to have this

00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,300
notion of things that incubate in the

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,070
spec and things that incubate an open

00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,410
source so that we have the right to

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,780
change them and we don't we know they

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,660
work by the time their standardized so i

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,539
think the

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,150
I don't think that standardization slows

00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,829
down innovation and in fact I think it

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,789
can work the other way I think you can

00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:42,920
innovate and drive creative things we

00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,349
did in OpenSocial this notion of

00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,809
bringing applications those social

00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:49,869
business applications directly into the

00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:52,579
stream and being able to launch those in

00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:54,799
context so that you don't have to jump

00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,309
out to these different platforms and

00:35:54,799 --> 00:36:00,140
that was all done and working prior to

00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:02,660
the standard be prior to officially

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,599
standardizing it so we innovated around

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,599
this idea of being able to have embedded

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,579
experiences in the stream in content you

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,930
know receive them an email open up these

00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:14,180
applications we did all of that

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,700
innovation we proved it out and then we

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,319
said okay now we understand how the API

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,569
is work now we understand the

00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,099
interaction model now it's time to lock

00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:24,170
it down and that's when we standardize

00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,299
it so I think innovation in

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,410
standardization go hand-in-hand and at a

00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:33,500
very fast pace thank you and Tim maybe

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,589
you also see your customers organization

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,819
public and private organization in this

00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:43,029
rush to for change rapid change agility

00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:45,950
algae help them transform themselves

00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:47,720
yeah I haven't seen a rate of change in

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,650
terms of enterprise IT like this in my

00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,069
career my 20 year career everybody's

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,779
kind of scrambling to incorporates a big

00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:59,990
data into their organization today and

00:36:56,779 --> 00:37:02,210
everybody's struggling with it the way

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,180
that we help organizations is really by

00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,740
helping them start small you know get

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,630
your win under your belt and then move

00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,000
forward that's really the the best

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,000
advice that we have for anybody that we

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,680
work with any time you try to boil the

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,170
ocean and change everything at once it's

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,970
just not going to work right so I mean

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,950
that's the it's it's the age-old

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,930
question you know how do i how do I

00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,579
incorporate this great technology and

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,559
have it affect every part of my

00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,930
organization and really quite honestly I

00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,029
think it's it's an organic growth is

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,400
what's happening especially with a dupe

00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:36,200
and big data you know we have customers

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,770
like there's a company in the States

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,630
called new star and

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:44,380
Hadoop and big data is being led out of

00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,920
the cios office or the CTOs office and

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:51,680
what we're seeing is small groups of

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,290
very intelligent technical people lead

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,670
up kind of projects and it's it's a

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,900
group of maybe five guys and they're

00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,300
going out and seeing how it might affect

00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,970
an entire organization and it's not our

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,600
job to really help them more than it is

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,950
to enable them so that the technology is

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,080
going to work within their organization

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,780
and that's really what we're all about

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,790
they go out and they find the projects

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,890
they create a platform for the rest of

00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,410
the organization to look at they go on a

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,080
road show they go to different business

00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,640
units within an organization say this is

00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,740
what the technology can do this is what

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,600
we've done already now you have to

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,100
create a business case on top of this to

00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,350
actually make it go out and happen so

00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,820
that's really kind of the the project

00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:35,630
we've seen so far in terms of adoption

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:39,800
of these new technologies yes thank you

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:43,880
helly did you already identify best

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:51,250
practices in organization facing such

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,250
mix situation like you said let me maybe

00:38:52,030 --> 00:39:02,830
talk about compliance because an

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:09,800
open-source market is 22 open maybe

00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:12,440
which is good but how we can ensure this

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,380
open source component or this open

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,650
source product is compliant with some

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:22,190
reference as maybe I not know let's say

00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,230
for application servers some criteria to

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:29,090
say this is an application server or not

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:31,040
who can ensure for that customer for as

00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:34,520
administration or any other enterprise

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,250
this component is compliant with this

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,500
reference I think this is not there now

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:42,470
we have some information and some

00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,660
standard information about maybe let's

00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,849
say the infrastructure component as that

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,849
I

00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:51,259
raises or operating systems or server

00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:56,880
application server or web servers but

00:39:51,259 --> 00:40:00,119
more components as I don't know crm ERP

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,759
on something of this kind of component I

00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,650
think it's important to introduce the

00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:11,579
compliance of this component this

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:14,190
component or product to have some I

00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:18,720
don't know certification Tom Paul went

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:21,329
on vaca d something says this is a good

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,640
product based on on some reference to be

00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,410
defined so do you invite the audible you

00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,380
to community at your place also

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:34,400
instances exactly eclectic ephod message

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,170
so what if today's open source software

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,349
challenges become tomorrow's opportunity

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:45,660
do you see new things evolving at this

00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:48,329
point wants to explain or share his

00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:56,910
vision about the change during the next

00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:59,519
coming here I think it's always

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,099
difficult to predict you know where

00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:04,170
industry there is change every day

00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:06,869
changing use ages the fact that

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,999
technology there but you need to find a

00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:12,779
way to use the technology to create a

00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:15,509
differentiation to create value so I'm

00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:19,529
convinced that there is some I and

00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:22,229
layers where the open source will will

00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:24,390
be the methods that the winner from a

00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:27,019
technology standpoint as soon as there

00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,670
is consumerization a high level of

00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:32,400
consumerization I'm convinced that an

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:36,839
open source approach for that specific

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,920
you know layer on the market will we win

00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:44,609
at the end you know why because as we

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,369
discussed before you share the research

00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,589
you share the development you share the

00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:53,009
testing you share the maintenance you

00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:54,280
share the integration and by sharing all

00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:57,020
this L

00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,160
basically you can you can get the best

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:03,410
do create trust in factor for example

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,780
it's alfonso yeah yeah so we we have a

00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:09,140
totally complementary so not that I'm

00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:12,290
disagreeing at all approach to that the

00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:14,119
example in our case is all the open

00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,339
source software that we are putting on

00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,349
top of Windows Azure as you may know

00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:22,250
windows azure is our public cloud

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,380
offering and as you may imagine this is

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,020
not a scoop everything is windows-based

00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,000
inside its Microsoft base however we are

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:32,180
providing market with open source and

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,490
pure open-source services so you can

00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,790
create your website and on top of your

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:41,000
that website you can put joomla you can

00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:44,660
put Drupal you can use PHP technology

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,520
and you create your website with that

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,470
open source technology and that service

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,809
being provided to you by Microsoft you

00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,210
can also do that at the infrastructure

00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,910
as a service level you can create Linux

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,940
machines so you can have Susie opensuse

00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:01,309
you bhuntu and sent us these are the

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,410
what we have and also you can go beyond

00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:05,869
that because you can take your own linux

00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,480
distribution and upload it to windows

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,339
azure and run it in there because in

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,750
that case you would be trusting

00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,280
Microsoft for those services that which

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,530
is delivered but you want to use your

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,660
own open source on top of that so in

00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,480
that in our case we are using open

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,430
source and therefore promoting it on top

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,740
of a platform as a way for open source

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,180
to take advantage from that thing so I

00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,670
think the two approaches the one that

00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,220
particular just explained on ours are

00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,670
two different ways to get there and to

00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,530
to to benefit from open source okay I

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,630
think sanuk sandals you know quite

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:42,589
honestly I feel the the days of closed

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:45,380
proprietary software are over it's done

00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,030
it's that that games gone it we're not

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,440
going to see that anymore and I'm sorry

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,500
here's Microsoft nodding their head next

00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,000
to us it doesn't make sense I read a

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,790
quote from google it was about maybe

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,470
four or five years ago they said that

00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:59,030
they are open where they create a

00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,520
community but closed where they make

00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,390
money and it's a great quote right

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,579
because it's

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,559
so true in terms of how companies go to

00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:09,380
market today look at what Microsoft is

00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,180
done with tech net I give a webinar to

00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,279
the Technic community and I have

00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,500
instantly a community of 5 million

00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:17,750
developers that are listening to what I

00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,510
have to say that's that's an amazing

00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,950
multiplier for a business right so from

00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,440
an open source point of view I think

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,990
open source really becomes a standard of

00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,630
everything to be built on top of mostly

00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,970
because our community has closed the

00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,579
world has shrunk and there's no way to

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:36,710
stop that from happening because we the

00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:38,930
power that the Liberty its democracy

00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,359
it's all the beauty of open source that

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:44,150
it was all started on in the first place

00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:46,220
overtakes the the larger aspects of

00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,630
things and I think that the quote to me

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,829
i think it's it's beautiful it's you

00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,539
know you're you're open where it creates

00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:53,839
multipliers and your clothes where you

00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:57,200
make money before we take your questions

00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:01,039
one word from an accent yeah according

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:05,019
to me there is too big way about big

00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:10,250
challenges for Pancho's the first one is

00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:16,339
contrary to some of the people who would

00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:18,589
like to say it's not a question of to be

00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:24,430
dogmatic or not the question of open

00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:27,740
source and to be able to handle

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:32,450
technologies is a question of strategy

00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:36,819
and I think we are not at the end of the

00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:39,559
story we just thought the story I

00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:41,869
remember 10 years ago Microsoft side

00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,759
okay that's that's no more question it

00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,430
will not happen it which stay at the

00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:50,180
poor lover and so on so and not they

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:54,650
said okay we are we live in a complex

00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:57,619
world it's an odd question and don't

00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:59,630
don't don't try to debate and don't try

00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:03,859
to discuss about that and I'm sorry I

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:09,849
phone so the debate is just began

00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:13,240
because now we have figures we are facts

00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:16,090
we have stories and

00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:20,170
and I think decision maker can take

00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:25,570
their own decision without the support

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:30,160
of all the lobby than big firms as yours

00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:32,260
are able to provide so that's not on

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,140
your question about the open source but

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:38,050
that also in question about the the way

00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,750
decision maker take the issues of

00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:43,180
Technology in the end so that's one of

00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:47,080
the big challenge for us I think we have

00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,440
to to be clear we have to promote we

00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:54,210
have still to be clear stood to promote

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:57,010
and to limit to to to to to walk on that

00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:01,960
the second things the second direction

00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:04,450
is more but I think we have a big issue

00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,660
to address with open source is the way

00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:12,930
we will be able to bring in the same

00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:17,040
community people from china for example

00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:20,740
you know there are so huge market there

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,720
but also on open source market and on

00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,970
open source community or some open

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,000
source communities but the main problem

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:31,060
that we have is in China people speak

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,040
Chinese the writing Chinese that don't

00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:36,160
write in English and as you know they

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,990
they have their own internet and so they

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,210
have their own open source communities

00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:44,710
for example in Europe in the u.s. we

00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:46,960
know all about hockey but in China no

00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:50,320
communities work on Apache that they

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,400
have their own kind of Apache community

00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:59,170
and one of our big subject big issue is

00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:02,410
to be able to join the Western community

00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:09,010
and the Eastern community and that's why

00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:12,220
I think that it's the job of a w-2 is so

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:14,500
important that's why I thought that we

00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,840
add to come back in this community

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:21,010
because I think that it's one of the

00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,080
rare place where the western open source

00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,829
world and the eastern open source world

00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,729
is able to

00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:32,469
to discus and we have to open these two

00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:34,849
words and to make them stronger in

00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:37,459
working together and that's one of our

00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:39,499
big issue today I think doin just a

00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:41,509
quick one uniform finish so first of all

00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,640
the debate has started a long time ago

00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:46,309
and will continue you and I debate

00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,019
enough we know that and on the other

00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,420
point you mentioned yes we agree I mean

00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:53,150
it's all about dialogue I talked about

00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,950
choice and you will you will not have

00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,450
choice and probably without dialogue so

00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:59,599
it's all about dialogue that already

00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,609
exists is nothing to do we may have to

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,650
improve it and it sorry or way there

00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:05,029
between east west and between orbitals

00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,400
and other purchased the scale is

00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:09,319
changing very fast on so we we need

00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,869
worldwide solution we need this and

00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:15,309
ability that we've talked about them and

00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:20,029
then you probably have questions about

00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:24,739
worldwide issues yes I'm arriving please

00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:27,619
state your name and organization okay I

00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:30,319
or bunny just read a manual de llegar

00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:33,799
dead I'm working from ZTE corporation rd

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:36,319
so I'm big Chinese an actor so my

00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:38,779
question is about the cloud computing as

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,849
an example for the open source and my

00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:43,130
question is regarding European market

00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:44,749
which is extremely fragmented in terms

00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:50,420
of number of countries size of

00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:54,680
individual market my question is do you

00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:58,959
think maybe mr. Starkel mr. Castro that

00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,299
we can reach in a frappe Utley

00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:04,160
significant size to be profitable

00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:06,469
because you know if we are comparing the

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,589
cloud computing in Europe and in the US

00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:12,759
in US they can play on the volume amazon

00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:16,039
google even microsoft is huge

00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:18,589
installation in france we need all

00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:22,910
germany in belgium and some of that we

00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:25,279
start with limited volume so my question

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:29,829
is do you think that open source is not

00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:32,569
the only solutions to be profitable in

00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:34,940
our case where I can what I can say it's

00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:36,020
back to to my presentation you know the

00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,940
aim

00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:43,970
if you want to win in that game the the

00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:45,620
critical mass is at Europe level as a

00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,390
matter of fact you know if you look at

00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,660
the french market or the German market

00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:54,650
or the Italian market we will end up to

00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:56,510
lose again that battle back to my

00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:59,030
presentation if you remember we we've

00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:02,510
been through five cycle if you look at

00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:06,860
this Feist cycle you don't have any

00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:09,800
European company who emerged and was

00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,440
part of the game you know I remain you'd

00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,900
mini the mini computer was the the

00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,780
winner where the us back our digital

00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:21,230
equipments and microsystem the mainframe

00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:23,120
was IBM if you look at the the micro

00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:28,460
computing in Europe we had a lot of

00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:30,020
names none of them made it so as a

00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,360
matter of fact you need to start from a

00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,730
market we are French company so we start

00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,610
with the French market but we should

00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:42,140
look as soon as possible to the European

00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:44,510
market at least otherwise again we'd be

00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:48,010
over very soon but what is important

00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:50,900
it's not because amazon web service as

00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:54,740
open already a few years ago that market

00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:58,690
that the game is over if we if we don't

00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:02,480
play at the European level we're out of

00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:06,290
the business we have a question from a

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:10,090
auto body to president thank you so I

00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:16,340
have a good question to ask Alex center

00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:19,720
okay such as a yeah premium mr. law

00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:22,880
letters who asked as a comment

00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:26,210
administrators pay attention to the open

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:30,530
source come duration so we need to have

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:33,320
a module to pray persuade my my premier

00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:37,270
mr. there should be motive but I

00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,950
actually already wondered so from your

00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:43,130
comments the officers at the mini

00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:45,630
Streeters they're using the open source

00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,480
just now you mentioned a lot of ativan

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:51,269
life there's only paid too much license

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,630
fees and create more jobs or viruses are

00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:56,700
such such those can be good since today

00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,190
single use the open source really

00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,950
reliable those security was this kind of

00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:06,599
problem what do they sing and are really

00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:09,180
interested how to use force with them

00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:14,160
let them to really believe what pudding

00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:16,049
sauce really usable and just know you in

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,839
your speech looks like you quite

00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:21,509
familiar the Chinese society and in your

00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:25,190
Island so I really like to listen to us

00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:36,089
what can your recommendation thank you

00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:39,269
so if so it's a big issue to be able to

00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:41,880
to convince and to brought open source

00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:43,440
through to the government and day to

00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:52,529
make them convinced that the right

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:54,089
solution and so on the things is that so

00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,559
they have started ten years ago and

00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:58,859
because they have started 10 years ago

00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:02,960
now they know that it's good solution

00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:05,990
for almost every level of the IT system

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,269
for example I remember that 10 years ago

00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:14,160
when we spoke about immigration from

00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:20,730
Oracle to an open source database it was

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:24,119
you know the big CIO said okay Alex I'm

00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:27,569
sure that you are right but you know we

00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,359
are the finance ministry we do very

00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:32,849
important things if our IT system

00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:35,220
doesn't work anymore we will not have

00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:37,440
any more taxes for France i shouldna for

00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,329
with our deaths the question to what the

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,950
taxes is something really important for

00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:49,170
our country and so so they said okay we

00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:53,059
will never go out a wrecker and I can

00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:57,570
what I can say today is all

00:54:53,059 --> 00:55:02,510
administration walk on plane to me

00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:06,180
right from a record to postgresql so

00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:09,720
they work on that that's really the

00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:13,980
present time and so one of the questions

00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:19,050
as you mentioned is to be able to assure

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:22,670
them that in terms of security you will

00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:26,610
find the same level of its insurance and

00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:29,610
that's even better if you use a pencil

00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:32,360
than to use preparator to use

00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:35,640
proprietary software on these points

00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,950
that they can be confident in a market

00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:42,120
which is something very important I

00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:44,760
think that you don't have a market if

00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,430
you have only customers or potential

00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,430
customers you have also to have big

00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:53,100
providers and this is one point for

00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,740
China I think it's important I don't

00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:59,160
think that you have red flag Linux I

00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:01,620
know very well damn i met the death co

00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,690
many times last time we had tea together

00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,820
also which is something very important

00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:11,040
in chinese to have a tea and and to

00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:13,670
share me and so and so it's almost the

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:17,040
same size as Lena Garang so that's not

00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:19,680
enough big to be able to convince all

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,020
the Chinese administration to support

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,490
them and type them in dem aggression and

00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:28,860
so on so I i have only suggestion to

00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:31,260
make to you but what I think is because

00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,830
who are you you will decide by yourself

00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:38,270
but according to me you you should you

00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:43,590
have lunch and China I think 10 clouds

00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:45,810
center with IT providers with

00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,650
universities and so on you have you have

00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:52,710
done 10 clusters dedicated to cloud and

00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:54,720
I think that you should launch a big

00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:57,900
initiative in open source with a big

00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:02,940
University in Beijing or and maybe also

00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:05,610
in shahi and asking to a big providers

00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:10,010
and with some SMBs to work together and

00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:13,490
to develop their own skills and

00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:17,120
or soon to come here in Europe in the US

00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:19,700
and to bench what the government I've

00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:22,610
done and to have all these benchmark in

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:27,710
their hands and try to convince the CIO

00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:31,970
from China that they they can run open

00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:34,370
source software variously and and and it

00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:36,500
works perfectly you know cue Alex say

00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:39,230
I'm sorry the the time is running it's

00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,480
almost noon we we have to conclude now

00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:43,490
maybe this is the next challenge and we

00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,150
have to think about this for the coming

00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:48,560
year education in open source and

00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:51,980
vocalization evangelization is a one of

00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:56,320
our mission at the moment thank you for

00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,320
