	ETICS: quality certification of open source cloud software - Gabriele Giammatteo, Engineering Group
AbstractÂ :  Cloud Computing is becoming the new paradigm for the Internet and Service provisioning. Open source solutions, especially those resulting from R/D projects, often are neglected due to the absence of track-records in use by real world applications. ETICS is a build, test and certification software developed since 2004 and up to now used at CERN, ENG and others to build and test various complex software systems, such us glite (http://glite.cern.ch) and gcube (http://www.gcube-system.org). ETICS will be used in the Ocean support action to certify the quality of RTD open source cloud software. Ocean aims at identifying and tracking open-source cloud development projects in an open online portal to promote cross-project collaboration. Ocean will also provide projects with an on-demand build and test service reducing their need for installing and operating tools, and a beta-tester service giving them back a comprehensive review and feedback. This presentation provides an overview of the ETICS approach and tool and the way it's planned to be adopted within the Ocean project.
