Description: 
	Building an application on the SugarCRM platform - John Mertic, Sugar CRM
AbtractÂ : Need to build an application to run part of your organization? One approach is that you could start writing something from scratch, perhaps leveraging an existing general purpose framework to help get you going. However, even if you use a framework, there's still the need to build all those standard components such as user interface, workflow, and ACL security, which can take quite some time to design and code. There's no need to start from scratch; SugarCRM is designed as a Rapid Application Development platform. In this session you'll learn the basics on how to build a business application on the Open Source SugarCRM platform.

I've done really about SugarCRM have

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,250
done two of them to give us some

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,200
background building on sugarcrm which is

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,420
designed to kind of help get you started

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,640
with with building your own application

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,410
on Sugar CRM and then the definitive

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,870
guide which is a deeper developer guide

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,160
into I'm the sugar serum the first one

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,200
was just actually just updated a few

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,329
weeks ago so it's very recent the other

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,190
one's a bit older but still has a lot of

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,739
very good relevant formation for the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,449
platform so what I want to kind of

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,000
talked about today here and then the

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,350
short 15-minute time span I have is a

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,780
couple topics one you know kind of

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,789
introducing you know what is crm

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,019
especially how we look at it and then

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,549
what makes sugar seer i'm kind of

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,270
different than what your traditional crm

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,650
has been over the years next I want to

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,090
kind of dig into what is the future of

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,439
serum where is it going what are the

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,869
what are the concepts that people are

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,909
looking at and you know what where's

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,250
that future and then really you know why

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,740
build on us you know why why look at

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,170
Sugar CRM is a development platform more

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,549
than just a simple application so what

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,619
is crm we'll just quite simply the

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,840
acronym customer relationship management

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,090
more specifically because it's all about

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,470
customers it's about growing and

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,259
retaining those customers how do you

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,240
interact with them how do you work with

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,619
them you know history about them you

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,229
know it kind of a kind of emerged from

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,939
the concepts of finding way to digitize

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,680
your rolodex right so you could find out

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,790
who you know as opposed to be happy to

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,070
flip through cards all the time to

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,829
remember who I was working with instead

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,210
taking that one step further and having

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,640
it on a digital form so I could look at

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,920
my computer but then the realization

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,420
came I have all this data at my hands

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,979
you know maybe I can do something with

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,110
it maybe I can garner some knowledge

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,790
about my customer you know how about

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,049
maybe I can put some transactional

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,720
history you know what businesses they

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,899
done with me recently you know what are

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,700
their buying pattern hat

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,530
you know things like that you know what

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,540
am I contacts or their touch points with

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,579
us that they attended webinars of ours

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,400
have we done the attended events of ours

00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:22,450
and they downloaded white papers

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,099
learning all of that kind of passed

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,720
information about them and then being

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,489
able to make more conscious decisions

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,290
about them and then taking you the next

00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,730
step forward is now that I know you know

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,209
these conscious decisions people are

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,239
making about about you know our

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,980
customers are making now maybe I can

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,269
build workflows around it you know so I

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,739
see these people maybe or make

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,569
downloading a lot of white papers that

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,159
attended a couple of our events or they

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,810
show an interest in particular product

00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,709
line you know maybe now I want to direct

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,970
them you know to an additional resource

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,260
maybe I want to you know specifically

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,209
reach out to them and say hey you know

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,620
you've downloaded a white paper on you

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,060
know this product of ours maybe I can

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,639
give you a demo tour you know for

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,810
example so really trying to garner some

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,159
information it kind of goes a little bit

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,200
along the lines of some of that big data

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,909
but even on a more granular scale of

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,650
seeing exactly what are those pieces and

00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,150
how they all connect together and then

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,250
how can I make a buying how can I make a

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,840
selling decision to a customer based

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,599
upon you know the habits they've already

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,000
had with us so talking about us you know

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,230
sugar in the crm space we pay you that

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,790
we position ourselves as the

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,510
fastest-growing syren company in the

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,079
world where we're worldwide with

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,959
partners all over the globe over 400

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,699
partners on five continents we have our

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,040
main offices in cupertino california

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,840
with an emmy office here in Munich and

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,090
we also an IBM Global Partner so we're

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,549
really big getting big into the

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,169
enterprise space that way with huge

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,079
traction huge billing growth over the

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,400
last number of years edition wise we

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,870
have five editions of the product the

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,470
first one is our base open source

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,040
addition we kind of we embody the nekkid

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,260
bit of an open core business model but

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,790
by the same token there's no

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,590
restrictions on our base edition it's a

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,659
free open product you can use it for any

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,250
number of users any number of scenarios

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,829
you can extend it any number of ways

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,139
it's under an eight gplv3 license you

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,959
can do anything you'd like with it

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,489
within those terms and and and there's

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,500
no restrictions than every users you can

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,739
use their the commercial editions build

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,930
upon that adding featured functionality

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,280
that best suits larger audiences so the

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,960
professional starts to build

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,610
on feature and corporate builds on

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,260
feature functionality for the SMB

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,730
segment and then the enterprise and

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,889
ultimate edition builds on it for the

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,970
bigger enterprise segment of some future

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,330
functionalities are very specific

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,520
towards them so what really makes sugar

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,260
different and you know we there's a lot

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,760
of competitors serum is not a new

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,800
concept it's been around for a number of

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,080
years you know harking from the days of

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,240
SIBO you know going through kind of the

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,680
consumerization stage of you know

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,360
products like Act which you could buy it

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
any Italy I don't know here in Europe

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,810
but you could go at any office supply

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,560
store in the US and you could pick up a

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,090
copy of it but it's transforming and

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,430
it's and it's more than just a solitary

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,440
you know application but it's kind of

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,060
transforming on the way people work so

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
we what makes us different what makes

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,410
our outlook different especially with

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,180
the number of our competitors also you

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,250
know putting cloud offerings and whatnot

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,750
out there well the one thing we do is we

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,280
believe in putting the user first and

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,590
this is this is something that's

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,590
actually it seems on the on the level

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,720
very very obvious you know of course the

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,940
user should be first but the reality is

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,770
the serum to CRM systems were designed

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,300
for Selah CRS cut sales managers to

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,640
basically keep an eye on their

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,500
salespeople and be able to manage you

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,550
know their their forecasts and things

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,740
like that it was never really designed

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,870
with a user in mind it was designed so a

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,490
company could keep an eye on you know

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,110
what its pipeline is looking like what

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,820
its forecasts you know scenarios are

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,979
looking like but it really wasn't

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,720
designed for a sales person to actually

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,820
be effective in communicating with a

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,100
customer it wasn't designed to give them

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,169
that intelligence to be able to really

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,490
intelligently sell to a customer know

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,600
you know what their buying habits are

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,130
what are they doing you know some of

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,620
those questions I talked to earlier

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,150
really were never addressed and you know

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,830
and in a fundamental level that the

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,500
systems were often complex they were

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,150
archaic they were painfully use and you

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,720
know customers really didn't like them

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,669
and and is one thing we found out with

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,650
CRM adoption it's a very powerful piece

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,380
of software but the number one problem

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,000
that people run into with adoption of it

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,800
or you know adoption within the company

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,240
is this the user feedback users just

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,550
don't want to use it because it's too

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,860
complicated it's too painful to use it's

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,780
not it doesn't help their workflow at

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,310
all and it better and if anything it

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,870
kind of hurts them it makes them do more

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,820
work so our

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,620
let's put the user first let's find ways

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,810
to make the system be more advantageous

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,510
for them to be a part of versus the

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,390
opposite we believe in the open cloud

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,790
and the one unique thing we try to bring

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,040
to the table is we don't tell you where

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,720
to put your data or your application you

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,240
know you can host with us if you'd like

00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,890
but you could also host in your own data

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,090
center or you can put out a number of

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,520
clouds you know we're a lamp based

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,490
application so anywhere that you can run

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,940
a light based application you can run us

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,230
there's no restrictions that way we are

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,640
we encourage people to actually run a

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,430
different you know and we see that with

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,140
our customer base you know typically for

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,820
our customers we have about a third that

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,960
will run in our data center we have a

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,370
third that will run in their own data

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,050
center and we'll have a third that run

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,510
on one of the number of clouds out there

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,860
so we see that diversification already

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,020
across their customers and they come to

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,880
appreciate that versus many of their

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,070
offerings out there that have forced you

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,230
into running into their data center or

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,480
their environment and you're quite

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,100
restricted because of that and we

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,500
believe in the open ecosystem you know

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,090
we believe in we want to keep

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,310
interacting with ever the providers we

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,750
don't necessarily need to be the end-all

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,550
and be-all and provide every single

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,960
feature to the customer but we want to

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,190
make sure that whatever systems you

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,080
bring to the table that you need to

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,850
integrate with you need to support that

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,130
we can integrate with those quite easily

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,690
and you know and looking at it with even

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,050
within the owt ecosystem there's a

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,690
number of them that we partner with from

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,520
our alliances program to help deliver

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,560
solutions you know be need a soft talent

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,040
which was just here on the stage mxo and

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,960
you share soft so what is the future

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,120
serum look like you know it's a very

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,590
transforming world right now and you

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,180
know with the concepts of big data and

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,410
things like that coming to the play you

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,540
know we're to see your I'm fit into this

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,940
is it is it getting its getting past

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,730
that that digital rolodex and that

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,990
simple workflow but really learning how

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,970
to manage some more complex

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,280
relationships so there's this concept of

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,990
what's called xrm and it's really taking

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,780
the customer per se out of it and not

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,250
making it a very customer focused the

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,600
determining that that's the only purpose

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,420
used for it but it's anything

00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,460
relationship management the xrm term

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,920
where you know it's it's about

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,160
connecting data together and building

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,889
and fostering those connections so

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,600
how do you know it's more than just your

00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,220
customers maybe your suppliers maybe

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,170
your providers you know maybe different

00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,879
sorts of entities and it really takes

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,430
the seer I'm kind of focused out of you

00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,110
know as strict you know always having to

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,790
be a part of your sales team focus but

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,439
then now kind of encompasses other parts

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,699
of your business you know maybe you're

00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:10,259
managing different sets a date maybe

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,269
you're managing internal data maybe

00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,319
you're managing internal processes maybe

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,300
you're managing to all sorts of

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,279
different relationships the concept of

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,300
serum actually applies to a lot of that

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,800
of how you would do it you know but it's

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,100
not necessarily a customer focus

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,149
activity like it was in the past so the

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,649
common question I these from a

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,170
developer's standpoint i always get is

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,060
like okay this sounds really great but

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,529
there's a million web frameworks out

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,500
there why the heck would i even you know

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,939
what relational date is nothing new why

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,100
would I just build on sugar Sam what's

00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:42,959
what's my advantage there and the one

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
thing I kind of looked at is the

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,069
evolution over time of what web

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,600
developments kind of got itself into you

00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:51,000
know and we started from the very simple

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,980
stages of CGI scripts and all that kind

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,470
of stuff and moved on and we've kind of

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,389
evolved now to wear a lot of those web

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,269
frameworks are is that that general

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,889
purpose framework stage which is really

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,420
really interesting and they've they've

00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,370
really enabled a lot of web development

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,240
to move forward but I think the next

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,149
stage we're getting towards this

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,680
application platforms and that's where

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,630
I'm seeing us you know other platforms

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,310
like drupal and things like that which

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,829
are really as opposed to having things

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,350
very wide band it's a narrow band and

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,139
making it easier to get applications out

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,610
there a lot faster without having to

00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,180
kind of reinvent the wheel for all these

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,319
common components all over there and the

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,350
other thing we're seeing is the future

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:32,670
is open standards for interoperability

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,980
you know being team players are being in

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,230
interact with other different components

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,189
quite easily and leveraging open

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,540
standards which is why we've

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:43,649
participated in a number of open

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,540
standards institutions me personally I

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,939
sit on the board of OpenSocial I'm on

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,040
the board here of the UW to Foundation

00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:53,009
and I'm also part of the w3c community

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,720
and business groups so we use that as a

00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,579
way to kind of help file clusters of

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,209
standards around some of these new

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:03,059
concepts and help keep a not only a

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,490
level playing field but making sure that

00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,930
interop

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,450
ability but it's always continued to

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,279
exist so quickly which I only have a

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,450
couple minutes left I was kind of skim

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,810
through here a little bit with Syria

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,220
sugar gives you I'm out of the gate here

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,750
so we look at a modular design so you

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,730
can interact components relatively

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,630
easily you're not kind of you know we

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,730
have a lot of people that will take some

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,470
of the components in the rip number of

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,970
them out and they'll put new ones in and

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,860
our modular design enables that

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,440
relatively easily we have an MVC

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,810
framework which you know has the you

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
know the typical things that a

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,500
development relatively easily make it

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,589
simpler to build upon we use metadata

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,899
driven views and this enables us to

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,850
quickly build out applications faster

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,040
because the the typical apple the

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,860
typical workflow we see on crm is it has

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,230
a very credit update trait retrieve

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,610
update delete so our concept is that we

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,920
can make it as easy as possible build

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,750
those sorts of forms of that enables the

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,390
thing people to move quickly and with

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,620
our developer tools you can actually sit

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,120
in front of your customers and actually

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,520
really design how their workflow their

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,899
application goes and then go back and

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,820
fill in the gaps later so it really

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,550
enables you know quick design and an

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,260
easy way to get started user

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,450
authentication and access control with

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,680
several different layers in there the

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,750
ability to integrate with external

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,670
services both from the outbound so from

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,680
it within the app being able to reach

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,959
out to external services and grab data

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,940
and pull back and forth and then web

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,550
service API so that applications can

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,760
communicate back within it as well a

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,709
simple the administer application very

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,660
easy to use developer tools with studio

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,190
module builder there's tons of stuff you

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,020
can do not even have to touch a line of

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,620
code and with sugar logic you can do

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,839
very simple logic within forms to very

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,390
complex stuff including roll-ups and

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,980
whatnot the code base itself is designed

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,529
to be very upgrade safe so you can

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,029
customize the app quite a bit but also

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:56,560
not compromise your ability to upgrade

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:58,240
later on down the road and so here's

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,430
some risa again a couple resources here

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,660
about a couple books sugar for chart org

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,810
we also have sugar exchange which our

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,190
app marketplace and some sort of

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,790
research will to kind of follow up and

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,810
with that that is it any questions

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,930
right let's crank yoooo tonight thank

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,930
