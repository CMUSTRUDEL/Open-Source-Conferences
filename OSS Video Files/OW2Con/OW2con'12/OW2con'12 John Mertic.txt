Description: 
	Building an application on the SugarCRM platform - John Mertic, Sugar CRM
AbtractÂ : Need to build an application to run part of your organization? One approach is that you could start writing something from scratch, perhaps leveraging an existing general purpose framework to help get you going. However, even if you use a framework, there's still the need to build all those standard components such as user interface, workflow, and ACL security, which can take quite some time to design and code. There's no need to start from scratch; SugarCRM is designed as a Rapid Application Development platform. In this session you'll learn the basics on how to build a business application on the Open Source SugarCRM platform.
