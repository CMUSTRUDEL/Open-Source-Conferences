Description: 
	CompatibleOne the Open Source Cloud Broker - Jamie Marshall, Prologue
AbstractÂ : Next generation cloud service management software will offer service brokering capabilities. This session will provide an overview of the architecture of an open source cloud service broker that would allow for the description, provision, deployment and management of any type or configuration of cloud services delivered by heterogeneous cloud service providers in accordance with a consumer's SLA. A broker allows the federation of resources across heterogeneous Cloud Service Providers and thus plays an important role in avoiding vendor lock-in. The session will end with a live demonstration showing how a federation of multiple OpenStack providers can be managed by CompatibleOne, an open source cloud service broker, in a multi-cloud environment.
