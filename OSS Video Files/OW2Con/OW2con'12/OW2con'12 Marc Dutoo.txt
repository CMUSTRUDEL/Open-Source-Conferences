Description: 
	Consistent service integration in your workflows with Scarbo 2.0 - Marc Dutoo and  Yoann Rodiere, OpenWide
AbstractÂ : Scarbo is an open, complete, SOA ready, SCA powered, OW2 and Eclipse-based BPM solution. The 2.0 release adds a major component to its SOA/BPM solution: a service registry and repository enforcing consistency across design time and runtime by acting as a pivotal reference. By integrating with the EasySOA registry (, Scarbo opens up the door to BPM / SOA governance and documentation, benefits from service discovery to ease up service reuse, while making switching from test to production service endpoints a breeze. This talk will introduce the audience to its OW2-based architecture integrating components such as Bonita, FraSCAti and Nuxeo, and show how end users can benefit from Scarbo 2.0 with a demonstration.
