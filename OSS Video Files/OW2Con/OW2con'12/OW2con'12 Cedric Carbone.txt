Description: 
	"The Big Challenge of Big Data and Hadoop Integration - 
Cédric Carbone, Talend"
Abstract :  Enterprises can't close their doors just because integration tools won't cope with the volume of information that their systems produce. As each day goes by, their information will become larger and more complicated, and enterprises must constantly struggle to manage the integration of dozens (or hundreds) of systems. Apache Hadoop has quickly become the technology of choice for enterprises that need to perform complex analysis of petabytes of data, but few are aware of its potential to handle large-scale integration work. By using effective tools, integrators can process the complex transformation, synchronization, and orchestration tasks required in a high-performance, low cost, infinitely scalable way. In this talk, Cédric Carbone will discuss how Hadoop can be used to integrate disparate systems and services, and provide a demonstration of the process for designing and deploying common integration tasks.
