00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,579
what challenges men reeva is facing and

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,010
what child what challenges are ahead in

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,109
terms of open source and my colleague

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,149
Michelle will present you more in depth

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,590
in in terms of technical part and what

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,850
research projects we are participating

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:10,200
in relation to open source so mandriva

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,689
is a french operating system company and

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,840
we are doing mandriva linux operating

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:20,070
system since 1998 we are also providing

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,229
enterprise products which are mandriva

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,270
business server and mandriva pulse

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:30,090
solution and we are in research project

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,270
since last 14 years and we have a big

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,460
knowledge base and skill set in working

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,630
with collaborative research and focus

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,090
research men riva has it's a small

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,850
company we have around 45 people today

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,909
20 people working in france and another

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,670
20 in working in brazil our consumer

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,369
product is done in Brazil and we have

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,500
our QA center as well as development

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:02,219
center for enterprise products in Paris

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,759
the operating system in terms of desktop

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,970
in terms of server and IT asset

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,129
management and IT system management

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,610
application which meant River do all are

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,280
under GPL and

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,440
all are provided free and it's under

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,540
open-source standards and everything is

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,970
open source it's available in 2 72

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,060
languages and available in 90 different

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,450
countries so it we are on a platform

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,880
approach so we are working with lot of

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,990
hardware vendors and lot of I is 3 and

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,570
software vendors so this is the area

00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:42,640
where we are right now providing

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:44,709
open-source application and platform it

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,260
is mandriva is a strategic player

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,560
because Suzy used to be German and it's

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,050
taken over by Noel and Mac is again

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,410
American Noel is American Red Hat is

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,959
American and Microsoft is American so

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,570
mandriva is the only general player a

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,340
generalist player who is from your open

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,560
from France who is providing desktop

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,270
server and IT asset management solution

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,000
so these are the three products which we

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,489
offer in open-source arena first is the

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,480
pulse solution which is again IT

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,600
management heterogeneous application

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,390
which help in managing inventory

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,360
software and hardware it also help in

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,970
distributing software it also do remote

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,209
control management and it also do

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,459
imaging and remote backup it is

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,680
available on premise as well as on cloud

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,040
the cloud version we learnt just a month

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,380
back we have MBS which is the main river

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,500
business server this is a basically a

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,510
mission critical server which a lot of

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,690
other companies in open source are

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:56,019
providing but we are providing with a

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,560
easy-to-use wizard for SMEs and Soh oh

00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:03,100
we can install third-party application

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,950
easily on open source stack server and

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,500
we have the third product which is on

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,200
the consumer market and that's product

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,420
is very interesting this is on a desktop

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,310
operating system on the client side and

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,200
this helps teachers to manage class so

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,310
they can provide they can do

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,410
broadcasting they can do quiz they can

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,760
manage

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,449
application on the student so you can

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,169
have a interactive classroom session

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,760
through mandriva class application and

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,130
the good thing about this application is

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,740
that it works on Windows it works on mac

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,520
it works on any other flavor of linux

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,070
operating system these are some of the

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,100
customers but I will take more time to

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,430
provide you you know what we have done

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,830
recently in relation to our work in open

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,889
source in Brazil we were present with 0

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,090
W to last year also in Brazil and we

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:06,220
have our own around opens open-source

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,860
lab and we are working very closely with

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,090
Intel and positivo in Brazil so we have

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,360
done a product in you this is a product

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,840
which we have done in Brazil this is

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,870
basically the stat which sits on this I

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,080
will say a laptop small laptop for

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,900
education it's open source its main

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,630
rival Linux running on it it's a special

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,090
customized product designed for

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,160
education the whole product is less than

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,770
two hundred dollars the hardware as well

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,020
as the software and the price point we

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,479
able to reduce is only because of open

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,510
source you cannot do it with Microsoft

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,169
licenses so that is the advantage of

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:54,210
using open source application this is we

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:56,500
are deploying almost 1.5 million units

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,410
400,000 units are already been deployed

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:05,710
and next year we would be deploying

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:08,500
another half a million units this just

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,199
the story about this there was a big

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,660
challenge to convince the Brazilian

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,090
government it was a initiative taken by

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,599
the Brazilian government to provide one

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:21,880
pc per child and it was very interesting

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,680
and challenging because it was help it

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,560
was helping to remove the digital divide

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,780
which exists and open source is a

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,060
leveler and it helps to provide a

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,979
low-cost IT solution for education I

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,440
invite now Michelle to provide more on

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:41,500
research so

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,620
good afternoon everybody so I'm Michele

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,010

I presents you what we did there what we

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,560
do in research and innovation so mantra

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,110
will involve in many projects in a

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,330
research project you can see here the

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,090
logo of the logos of the different

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,850
project and thanks to our knowledge in

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,770
open source we bring we were involved in

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,030
lot of project with partners because we

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,430
bring we we bring good skills

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,220
competencies in open source which is

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,570
where we needed in research project and

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,820
that's why now bronze Eva's has decided

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,820
to do to create a department the

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,310
specific department for for research and

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,980
innovation that's why I'm I'm very glad

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,560
to introduce another so in a wise the

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,280
Department of research and innovation in

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,330
forum on Treva and what we bring is a

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:44,620
customized open source operating systems

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,090
because on without knowledge we are

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,360
involved we were involved in the

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,940
operating system and I will show you in

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:57,040
next slide what we we do we are doing

00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:00,700
now and on on a project and also we

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,740
thanks to our product parts we are

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,050
involved in IT infrastructure in IT

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,910
management so now we are we are able to

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,250
bring to research project that kind of

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,580
competences and so we are involved in

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:18,430
clover collaborative research as such as

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,780
a loose i will discuss next so we are

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,970
involved in three main topics

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,100
collaborative research advanced research

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,560
a transceiver bansuri and focused

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,710
research so I will explain you with you

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,200
what we are doing here for clarity with

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,740
collaborative research we are now

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,620
involved in three project compatible one

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,419
as you is well known now inaudible you

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:47,530
to Celine Celine is a project for ebook

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,110
a framework for ebook and elyse elyse is

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,440
a project

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,899
it's a xml system for infrastructure at

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,930
the end of a loose we normally we be

00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,920
able to have I live a language to say

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:04,200
okay we need an application for able to

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,100
manage I don't know 1,000,000 collection

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,380
and okay what do you propose for as an

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:15,300
infrastructure for that so it will be

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,850
we'll have vegan allege in the fracture

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,190
to propose to a proposition for that

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,850
kind of high level language advanta

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,070
Batman this is the activities we have

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,860
for technology watch and for new product

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,860
it's about a short term vision to see

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,380
what is a market and what we can do for

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,290
the next market so we were involved in

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,940
for new feature new product and industry

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:45,209
a partnership for example and focus

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,110
research we train that department that

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,360
activity two to bring our knowledge in

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:54,570
marketing in business development to

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,699
help researcher to to try to

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,550
commercialize their product because they

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,070
have big products we have a specific

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,620
project but now how can we do what can

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:12,079
we do to commercialize our product or

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:12,079
