Description: 
	VENUS-C: lessons learned of using open source clouds in eScience - Andrea Manieri, Engineering
Abstract : VENUS-C is the first European distributed computing infrastructure to adopt a User-centric approach to Cloud Computing, putting the needs of end-User communities of researchers and small businesses at the forefront of development. A representative User community sample was composed by the 7 scenarios, the 15 pilots and the 5 experiments from eleven different disciplines and SMEs. Chief among the success stories is Green Prefab, a start-up company for architects and civil engineers, which hosts a new innovation cluster stemming from VENUS-C, HUB-Engineering (http://www.hub-e.com/). The VENUS-C Architecture Report describes the blueprint for the platform based on which a reference implementation has been done applying a rapid prototyping approach with interactive releases and User validation. The project publicly released open-source components (, namely: • Generic Worker (PMES (Process Management Enactment Services) and programming framework) • COMPSs (PMES and programming framework) • CDMI Proxy • Accounting and billing service • Traffic Redundancy Elimination (TRE) • Interoperability Toolkit As a result, it is clear that the adoption of Cloud and Virtualisation technologies and services is a win-win situation for the scientific community, as it releases benefits for both research institutions, industry.

when you see ended four months ago in in

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,929
July and was judged by the European

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,900
Commission as an excellent project in

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,220
term of results they infrastructure and

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,189
a support to the software will be given

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,269
by the partners until one year more

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:28,289
until june 2013 so you still have some

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,500
time to get the results and interact

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,480
with the programmers and the developers

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,469
venice ii was about allowing the

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,710
scientists the circlet long-tailed

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,969
scientist those that doesn't have access

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:48,629
to big computing resources like

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,629
physicist at cern or biochemistry at

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:58,309
embl in order to develop short term or

00:00:53,629 --> 00:01:06,479
one short experiments and analysis over

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:08,250
their data and we developed the platform

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,430
for the scientists in collaboration with

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:19,110
the microsoft and the acer team and we

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:22,890
allow the day scientists application to

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,369
run seamlessly on an openable a base at

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,270
the infrastructure and microsoft ezer we

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:35,430
have developed a set of let a platform

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:39,409
level AP is in order to make more easy

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,079
day development and deployment of the

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,540
application in in a cloud environment we

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,640
have basted in order to interact with

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:53,450
the with the infrastructure layer we

00:01:47,640 --> 00:02:00,210
have pasted our system on the OCC I

00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:06,270
interfaces extending them for in order

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:11,459
to have the ovf messages past part the

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,680
OCC I api's during the project it was a

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,590
two years project after one year we

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,629
already had a better version on which we

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,349
had some internal testing made by seven

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:28,800
scenarios seven partners that provide

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:31,680
the seven different scenarios and we

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,060
launched at an open call an open call

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,400
for other scientists that could use the

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:45,390
infrastructure and the platform in order

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,269
to provide extra requirement and being a

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,150
sort of beta testers of day of the

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,930
platform so after two years of project

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:59,390
and 24 25 different application running

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:03,900
over this platform I can say that this

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:07,670
was a very nice result and consolidated

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:12,080
set of components so as I said before

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,640
our objective was to see it on top of

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,530
infrastructure as a service and platform

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,769
in order to provide a set of services

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:26,750
that can allow a seamless integration of

00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:29,670
different platform and in an

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,930
infrastructure-as-a-service layers in

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,049
terms of community in venue see we got a

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,799
very huge number of a different

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:49,170
scientific domains and as I said before

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:52,530
the this instrument this this option for

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,439
using an open calls allowed very very

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,930
huge participation from people external

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,010
to the project that doesn't that didn't

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,450
participate to the conceived a

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,849
conceptual phase of the project and

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,760
provide the extra requirement and extra

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:13,680
extra support so in terms of concept

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,739
architecture what we have developed is a

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,209
set of component that could

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:24,599
allow the deployment of different

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,880
programming models we develop a two

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:29,789
different set of programming models one

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,340
based on parallel parallel programming

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:37,680
and one based on batch of jobs that can

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,910
be instantiated into the execution

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,970
environment and a set of management data

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,300
interface is based on Cydia my standards

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,759
in order to allow the application and

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,650
the programming model enactment

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:59,520
component in order to extract and store

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,520
the data in the storage services

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,500
provided by these infrastructures or

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,860
platforms in terms of components here

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,289
you can see where we use a different

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:18,990
standards the resource usage in term of

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:21,750
as part of the accounting and billing

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,479
system the base in term of the

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,469
programming model enactment occi ends

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,960
near cdma these were the component that

00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:34,800
we have developed and how this can be

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,940
used in order to run deploy around

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,759
application all their releases are open

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:47,849
sources and have been released under the

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,949
the project the project Forge and our

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,110
release it under Apache to that zero so

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:55,860
including the component developed by the

00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:00,020
Microsoft guys from the European

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,020
Microsoft innovation innovation center

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,069
in there were different type of usual

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:11,580
usages that you can that the users did

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:15,000
they use it to provide hydro computing

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,880
to follow data to have a data flow of

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,400
different jobs and coordinate different

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,199
jobs at the different fine gray need

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,580
details in particular for biochemistry

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,370
computation these were some example of

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,030
the scenario

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,510
that we have we have supported in the

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,520
during the last year the second year and

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,210
we can say that it was a quite

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,060
successful some of the project the

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,740
scenarios I have been engaged with some

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,840
of the partners in order to continue

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:57,430
also on commercial basis their their

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,650
application these again a couple of

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:05,919
example the earthquakes progression

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:09,120
simulation done by the University of the

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:14,410
recently university of thessaloniki

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:22,210
there was a virtual talking computation

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:25,900
for in silico in computation in for drug

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,830
design and there was some analysis of

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:35,260
radiotherapy planning so in terms of

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:43,200
benefits there was a in the interesting

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:46,800
speed up in the performance using the

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,289
venue see platform with respect other

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:57,550
direct access to the other two to other

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:59,949
clouds and there was the interesting

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:03,990
feedback from four of the pilots as I

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:07,300
said before that conceived business

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,789
application based on the exercise done

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:17,220
within the within the platform so as a

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:21,479
result it was an interesting exercise

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,539
the scientists are facing with

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:28,090
requirements that you cannot find in the

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:31,419
usual market in the usual business so it

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,330
is interesting because they can pave the

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:36,339
way for future application and for

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,740
future use of the clouds so in that

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,479
sense was very interesting to work with

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,389
them

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:49,540
the most of the scientific application

00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:52,690
have been implemented and revealed some

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,699
interesting business scenarios and we

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:59,980
will see in the next month's of years

00:08:54,699 --> 00:09:02,040
what will come from from that so thank

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,040
you very much thank you again for the

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
