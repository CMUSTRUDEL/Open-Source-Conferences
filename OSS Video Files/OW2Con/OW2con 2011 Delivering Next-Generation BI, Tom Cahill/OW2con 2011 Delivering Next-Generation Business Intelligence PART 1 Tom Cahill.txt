Description: 
	So, how can these ends possibly be met with BI?  How can a next-generation business intelligence platform, based on open source software and technologies, drive the answer when the largest BI players seem unable to do so?  Affordability, simplicity and modern architecture are the answers.  Jaspersoft joined the OW2 consortium as a corporate member  in 2010 and is today involved in both leading OW2 initiatives: Business Intelligence and Open Source Cloudware. Join Tom Cahill of Jaspersoft for a real-world and practical discussion of these trends and convergences as well as an astute answer about how open source business intelligence provides the best modern alternative to aged, proprietary business intelligence software.
