Title: OW2con 2011 Delivering Next-Generation Business Intelligence PART 1 Tom Cahill
Publication date: 2012-01-09
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Delivering Next-Generation BI, Tom Cahill
Description: 
	So, how can these ends possibly be met with BI?  How can a next-generation business intelligence platform, based on open source software and technologies, drive the answer when the largest BI players seem unable to do so?  Affordability, simplicity and modern architecture are the answers.  Jaspersoft joined the OW2 consortium as a corporate member  in 2010 and is today involved in both leading OW2 initiatives: Business Intelligence and Open Source Cloudware. Join Tom Cahill of Jaspersoft for a real-world and practical discussion of these trends and convergences as well as an astute answer about how open source business intelligence provides the best modern alternative to aged, proprietary business intelligence software.

hi everybody how many people don't know

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:20,430
jaspersoft wow I don't I don't believe

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:24,660
you so this these slides are really the

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,460
general picture of the new IT world and

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,250
what that means for business

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,560
intelligence not everybody will have

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,370
seen slides like these so they are of

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,430
interest but they are encompassing when

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,450
I heard the topics that Christian and

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,610
Alessandra and everybody in mark are

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,129
going to talk about I was listening to

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,530
Stefano thinking actually what I'm going

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,430
to talk about includes all of those but

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,100
obviously not in the death that you will

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,760
hear in the other presentations and the

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,129
reason for that is that jaspersoft

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,520
really provides software primarily for

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:07,560
bi builders people who take our software

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,080
and then build BI solutions so mark has

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,860
built many di solutions using jaspersoft

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,720
and spa go and pentaho and others but

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,110
not the tahoe it's not till okay excuse

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,430
me so the point of it is that a bi

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,650
builder really needs to work with tools

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:31,049
platforms like jaspersoft like red hat

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:35,159
like even proprietary traditional tools

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:38,430
or newer ones like IBM InfoSphere

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,070
BigInsights items like these ok so the

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,770
purpose is building bi and building bi

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:48,360
in the context of the new IT world and

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:52,290
the new IT world according to mckinsey

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,430
is about a new class of company really

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,640
emerging so the use of web 20

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,659
technologies and the new blade that the

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,759
new IT stack would see another slide in

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,910
a few slides from now but the new IT

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,819
stack has evolved very considerably over

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,600
the last few years we know the stories

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,620
of social networking

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,920
big data Federation of data Federation

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,880
of servers Federation of everything and

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,610
so on but what does it mean for bi

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,890
builders that's really the thing that

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,830
we're we're most interested in and it

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,170
doesn't the new IT stack doesn't mean

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,990
the same thing for every kind of

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,220
software provider but for bi it's quite

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,100
specific so in the old data center

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,160
Centrex back really we had we look for

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,930
compute engines down the bottom a

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,940
combination of mainframe servers storage

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,630
but this is now infrastructure services

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,720
note the change we take this for granted

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,750
now but it has huge implications for

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,170
people who need to just make decisions

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,640
quickly on how their companies are wrong

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,510
obviously we're going from web apps our

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,390
infrastructure over to mobile jaspersoft

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,730
today just today I'm sure tomorrow will

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,000
be different is the only company the

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:23,320
only bi provider who supports iPad

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,660
browsers in bi as well as native iphone

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,060
apps there's no other big bi company

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,800
that does that why can we do it before

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,340
everybody else well because of our open

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,040
source model our innovation together

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,180
with the likes of red hat and together

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,910
with IBM is it is possible because we

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,250
have a huge community of developers who

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,030
want to run even faster all the time in

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,580
getting this solution involved you can't

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:56,640
do that with legacy software in the same

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,440
way so this new IT world is emerging

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,380
traditional bi platforms they just don't

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,000
fit into this that's what we're finding

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,190
it's not just what we're saying a

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,660
promisee it's true that's what our

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,590
customers are telling us all the time

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:14,230
and even most importantly also here in

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,210
France customers who are using our

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,620
community tools the stuff that's for

00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:22,360
free we consult with them extensively

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,580
when it comes to our product roadmap not

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,560
just for the community the free version

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,340
but also

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,370
for the paying version this guy Jeffrey

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,360
Moore has written extensively about the

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,880
new IT stack but the network centric

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,280
world were living in that and he's

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,520
talked about the consumerization of

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,950
applications and so if we have a look at

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,460
what new user requirements are we're

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:54,760
talking about the merging of all kinds

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,110
of expectations today but every one of

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:04,660
them has to have a consumer feel and a

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:07,750
consumer quality this is life of the 17

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,389
year old so it's lots and lots of things

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,650
open on a desktop or on the mobile

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:17,229
browser this is where 17 year olds live

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,610
now many of us live there because we're

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,080
in the technology business but not

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,570
everybody's in the technology business

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,250
okay but this is this is the new

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,970
generation the demographic is shifting

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,840
so incredibly quickly I don't know what

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:34,630
specifically the demographic shift in

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,020
France is like but certainly in Europe

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,840
for every one person that leaves the

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,000
services industry about four are joining

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,310
that's how quickly the services industry

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,530
has been grown over the last several

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:53,380
years and those four people that come in

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:57,160
have an average age of 23 that's a huge

00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:02,020
huge difference and a huge shift and

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:07,210
evolution and expectation because the

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:12,070
need for analytics self-service bi is no

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,820
longer just among senior management but

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,580
is now among all kinds of users that

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,479
shifting demographic is critical to the

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,990
development of BI solutions and so bi

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,139
builders need even more flexibility and

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,139
even more quality and ease of use in

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,570
order to deliver self-service bi in the

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:38,169
organization more importantly and this

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,310
is the really hard bit those platforms

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:43,700
need to be easier

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,800
to establish because the superuser that

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,110
skills the skills that that super user

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,710
has are actually coming down it's no

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,080
longer a clever developer it's now

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,420
somebody that just as interested or has

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:04,040
a mission so we're talking about you

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,460
know in the u.s. here of the 66 million

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,870
workers who potentially could use be I

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,170
just over two percent are actually using

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,250
it there's another conflicting slide

00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,680
here that says something about

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,070
twenty-five percent but the fact is that

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,010
I hope everybody will agree but we're

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,520
seeing it firsthand the more mobile and

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,490
more consumer like we deliver

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,390
self-service bi the more use there is

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,400
and that we're told will make the

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,520
company more competitive or productive

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,170
make it faster to react across all

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,790
levels not just at the top right

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,160
throughout the organization so we've got

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,320
you know what this is not this is not us

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,180
showing you that we we have also heard

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,390
of Facebook and we've heard of Twitter

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,400
and so on what it means is but the

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,180
expectations of people using these

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,620
applications today reflect the

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,940
expectations they have of all

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:07,250
applications so they don't want to use

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,710
LinkedIn and Twitter and Facebook and

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,600
then have to switch to an application

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,200
which is too heavy too difficult too

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,310
expensive too hard to use needs training

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:23,150
they don't get approval from their boss

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:26,720
these for what we call tenants of the

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,270
new IT world ubiquitous access you can

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,350
access this anywhere elegant

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:36,230
presentation and really these days we

00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,720
are so sophisticated in terms of the

00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,330
need for more and more elegant

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,120
presentation it's incredible not just in

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,430
our cars I saw some beautiful Ferraris

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,350
gone around the city today and my god

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,250
those Italians really know how to

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,180
produce cars but it's it's in the

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,730
presentation of our application

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,399
it's it's essential that they are ever

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,399
more elegance appealing and so honest

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,790
it's critical the aesthetics around

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:08,839
application presentation is up there

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:11,660
with Ferrari and then the BI builder

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,820
needs to be able to customize in a very

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,980
powerful way but it's not just

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,029
delivering really good data very quickly

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:23,529
but in a powerful way that can attract

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:27,580
the BI self-service user into exploring

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:31,910
where the issues are because using bi

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:34,279
means continuous use depending on the I

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,770
day and day out not just trying it once

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,959
and saying that report was good I'm

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,930
never going back to it that's not using

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,839
that's introduction it's a real use of

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:49,670
bi means that that user has to go back

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:53,720
in and actively engage as a part of his

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:58,310
or her job all the time that's a big big

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:01,760
step to take from 2% too many tens of

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,570
presents 1760 50 who knows and the

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,740
promise about FBI has been for decades

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,260
that more people will use it and

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,339
companies will become more competitive

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,270
but the promise has not been delivered

00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:20,089
on and so the imperative is getting

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,540
bigger and bigger and then also user

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,860
centric collaboration it this means

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,630
exactly what it is if you think of

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,110
collaboration that's user centric in

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:33,020
terms of social media and networking

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:37,220
applications that's the standard that bi

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,260
applications have to arrive at so

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,180
there's nobody here feeding now that

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,600
we're there yet not even jaspersoft

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,320
there's a long way to go we're just at

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,579
the beginning so the new IT world is

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
really also about standards-based

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,870
flexible architectures look at this

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,700
traditional bi marketing we're on the

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,860
bottom will see the sophistication and

00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,740
knowledge of the user as you get further

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,360
into analytics and self-service the

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,000
knowledge of the suit of the user has to

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,310
be higher and if you come back down to

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,950
traditional report

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,360
knowledge has to be lower but look

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,090
what's happened now in the newbie I

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,980
market it is that these pervasive bi

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,740
market forces these are the ones that

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,240
require bi to be embedded everywhere to

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,820
be integrated to be part of the normal

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,990
hourly work that somebody sitting at a

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,050
desk or out on the road needs to do they

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,520
need to be able to access

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,500
decision-making platforms and reporting

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,779
and interactive reporting and dashboards

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,940
and all of these things right throughout

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,100
the whole process of work and cell

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,860
services come right down to operational

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,170
reporting it's no good presenting

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:53,050
somebody with a PDF copy of tables and

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,540
charts and graphs and expecting them to

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,600
make better decisions in their job we

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,589
know that doesn't work anymore even the

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,940
nicest of graphs hard-coded

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:09,010
non-interactive they don't actually

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,380
modify our improved behavior somebody

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:16,060
can waive the report but are they making

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:19,710
decisions based on no highly interactive

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,710
that's what it needs to be

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,820
looks like I just had a data explosion

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,240
there the animation here isn't working

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,240
too well in PDF I saw this went from 2.5

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,490
Meg's to 10 megs when i went from

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,850
PowerPoint to PDF so this is going to be

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,200
painful just trust me i'm going to go

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,620
route through these slides because i

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,110
don't think you need to see PDF slides

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,540
loading here the big data explosion is

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,670
big I'm sure is a Christian you're going

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:55,730
to talk yeah so we'll get through those

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:57,590
good low caste open source approach who

00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,780
is not yet convinced because I've got a

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,840
very convincing argument who is not

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,860
convinced that using open source

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,470
commercial open source means you would

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,880
have a cheaper project a cheaper bi

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:16,460
solution dan using traditional bi

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,540
anybody's bit cynical because I know

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,310
that it's not free and even using free

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,230
software doesn't mean it's free because

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,780
there's all kinds of other costs

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,440
associated with open source but

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,750
commercial open source bi according to

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,450
not just our customers but according to

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,780
the analysts is a lot cheaper a lot

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,410
cheaper millions cheaper in big projects

00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,710
really cheaper so if we got bi and a

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:50,420
limited budget actually more can be done

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:52,250
with less money tdwi last year the quote

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,140
from there was business intelligence is

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:59,930
the new battlefield for software

00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:03,589
providers I think we guys know that it's

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:06,740
it's amazingly intense but for consumers

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:09,380
and for users of BI that's probably good

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,550
news the good news for us is that we all

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,170
seem to be surviving doing quite well so

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,650
as a result business intelligence will

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,010
be where strategic relationships are one

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,010
and last

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,880
so under survey done a TD WI has your bi

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,070
grouping tasks to do more with less in

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,680
the past two years and the fact is that

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,840
eighty-one percent at that conference

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,510
last year said yes and keep this is the

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,760
TDW why I think generally this was over

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:42,530
the course of the two or three or four

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,530
