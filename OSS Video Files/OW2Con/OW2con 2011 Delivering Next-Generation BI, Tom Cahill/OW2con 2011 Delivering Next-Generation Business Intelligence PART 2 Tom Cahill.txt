Title: OW2con 2011 Delivering Next-Generation Business Intelligence PART 2 Tom Cahill
Publication date: 2012-01-09
Playlist: OW2con 2011 Delivering Next-Generation BI, Tom Cahill
Description: 
	Speaker: Tom Cahill, Vice President EMEA, Jaspersoft
Abstract:Substantial consolidation of the largest BI software providers has left an innovation void which could prevent the adoption and use of reporting and analytics more pervasively.  At the same time, new technologies have emerged which provide greater possibility than ever to ensure broad-scale use of data analysis and, therefore, drive fact-based decisions.  And, the CIO and internal development teams are under stronger pressure than ever to deliver results and innovations that can help grow business revenue and create more efficiency and profit.  Further, end-user expectations for business intelligence solutions to be available using consumer-like, web-based point-and-click simplicity, has never been higher.  Adding to that, new data analysis problems need to be solved that include social media, workgroup collaboration, large distributed (even real-time) data sets, and superior integration of reporting and analytics into applications for operational business intelligence.
So, how can these ends possibly be met with BI?  How can a next-generation business intelligence platform, based on open source software and technologies, drive the answer when the largest BI players seem unable to do so?  Affordability, simplicity and modern architecture are the answers.  Jaspersoft joined the OW2 consortium as a corporate member  in 2010 and is today involved in both leading OW2 initiatives: Business Intelligence and Open Source Cloudware. Join Tom Cahill of Jaspersoft for a real-world and practical discussion of these trends and convergences as well as an astute answer about how open source business intelligence provides the best modern alternative to aged, proprietary business intelligence software.

where there's a clear splish and

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:17,220
deploying all open source be I think we

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,500
have small medium and large and so split

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,930
here is in the past three years in the

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,150
next three years where the budgets apply

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,760
again these slides available for

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,340
download here's an examples of tree

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,950
real-life projects small medium and

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,070
large and the savings associated with

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,879
each I'd pick the large one obviously

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,520
because big number is impress all of us

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,100
but the savings there were about 1.5

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,899
million dollars and that was a very

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,629
specific project for a us-based customer

00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:00,000
of jaspersoft of course whose name

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:03,660
escapes me right now sorry the BI

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,540
builder prize for anybody who gives us a

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,390

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,400
the BI builder in practice this is the

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,640
person I was referring to earlier it

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,009
could be an application developer in a

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,960
software company and is V it could also

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,000
be a data manager or a specialist or a

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,570
report writer we're seeing that the

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,750
profile of the average bi builder is

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:37,110
less and less technical that's the

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,290
average profile not all profiles so some

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,560
