Abstract: Nuxeo EP (http://www.nuxeo.org/) is an open source Enterprise Content Management project started in 2006, that integrates several innovative approaches: a component model and micro-service architecture inspired by OSGi and Eclipse's extension points, an SQL-based content repository, a rich set of features to make it possible to create specialized content applications out of the building blocks provided by the platform. In 2011, the Nuxeo EP project became an OW2 project. In this talk, we will present the architecture, features and roadmap for the project, and learn how to leverage it to build content-centric business applications, on traditional application servers or on the Cloud.
