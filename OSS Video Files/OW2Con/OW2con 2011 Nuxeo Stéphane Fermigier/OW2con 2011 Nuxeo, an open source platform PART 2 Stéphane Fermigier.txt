Title: OW2con 2011 Nuxeo, an open source platform PART 2 Stéphane Fermigier

Description: 
	Speakers: Stéphane Fermigier, Nuxeo
Abstract: Nuxeo EP (http://www.nuxeo.org/) is an open source Enterprise Content Management project started in 2006, that integrates several innovative approaches: a component model and micro-service architecture inspired by OSGi and Eclipse's extension points, an SQL-based content repository, a rich set of features to make it possible to create specialized content applications out of the building blocks provided by the platform. In 2011, the Nuxeo EP project became an OW2 project. In this talk, we will present the architecture, features and roadmap for the project, and learn how to leverage it to build content-centric business applications, on traditional application servers or on the Cloud.

okay so that this was a result technical

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,859
part I sorry the big the big picture so

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,820
what can you do with this this platform

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,039
as I said three three kinds of

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,080
application can be developed on top of

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,109
the Knicks your platform of course

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,929
turnkey ECM application that can be

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,030
developed by software vendors they don't

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,090
have you to be open source because we

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,120
use the lgpl license so it's not you can

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,879
build proprietary applications on top of

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,430
the platform and of course with natural

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:49,550
studio it's quite easy for someone who's

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,940
not cause as a developer to create

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:56,010
business application with real value

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,079
with business not with the business

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,140
knowledge they have accumulated in their

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:07,049
own experience into a given application

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,380
we can also or you can also develop

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,590
vertical or bespoke application using

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,259
all the extension power of the neck Co

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,360
platform and the last thing which is

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,430
also in the quite interesting is when

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,850
you are a software vendor with your own

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,840
platform but you for exams an ERP or a

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,939
CRM system but you need at some point to

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,670
manage document then it's quite it's

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,729
possible and quite easy to use the next

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,189
document repository just as a service

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:43,530
inside your own platform so you have

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,720
really to kind of a meaning nexeo with

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,520
another application either you embed the

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,619
other application inside an extra

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,829
platform or use do you use the next your

00:01:49,619 --> 00:02:00,090
engine and your you embedded inside your

00:01:52,829 --> 00:02:02,430
other application since the main theme

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,189
of this out w to occur france is the

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,090
cloud this light is about our project

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,730
about the cloud and all our project in

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,190
this respect evolve around the

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,010
compatible one project which is

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,490
sponsored and in which audible you to

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,240
participate quite actively so a first

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:29,270
level of nuxeo clarification is to

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:34,200
deploy in axial on top of yes of a vm

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:36,990
cloud infrastructure such as ec2 for

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,390
instance or OpenStack and also to

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,580
leverage some of the additional services

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,040
that you will find usually in these

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:50,010
platforms such as blob storage like s3

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,220
second level of clarification is to port

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,950
nuxeo on top of a Java platform as a

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,160
service such as cloudbees all such as

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:05,130
Jonas once the compatible one project

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,780
leads it to the point where it's usable

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:14,000
for us and in this case for us it's an

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:21,110
honor any ongoing process is to use the

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,110
osgi module system of which is already

00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:29,790
characteristic of Nick CEO to deploy

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,489
nexeo on an osgi cloud so I think we are

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,800
going to work on this in 2002 so air is

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,610
the last slide of the talk which is a

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:43,200
roadmap for next year so one of the main

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:47,040
topics will be full osgi support to be

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,670
able to embed nexeo and to run nuxeo in

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,340
any osgi and with any recent was GI

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,340
runtime such as Jonas offered such as

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,280
everyone their felix ever here for

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,239
everyone on the market but also to

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,260
leverage the new feature that are being

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:14,720
added to a CI or right now in relation

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,310
to the cloud another important technical

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,459
improvement is to support the new Java

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,120
EE standard Java EE 6 currently we are

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,630
aligned with Jie 5 and with Java if six

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,480
there are many simplification which

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,670
we'll actually mean that it will be

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,010
easier for developers to develop on top

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:40,230
of the platform using for instance CDI

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:44,160
the java at injects annotation which has

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,320
been standardized as part of hawaii rj

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,830
SF 2 which is a which has a simpler

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:55,410
model or at least is simpler to use as

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:58,200
than jess f1 and then developed an

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,590
actual keep on working on Lexie 0 as a

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,280
platform as a service and that's it for

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,280
