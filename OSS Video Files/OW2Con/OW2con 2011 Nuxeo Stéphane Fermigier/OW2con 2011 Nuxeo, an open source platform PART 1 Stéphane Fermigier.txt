Description: 
	Abstract: Nuxeo EP (http://www.nuxeo.org/) is an open source Enterprise Content Management project started in 2006, that integrates several innovative approaches: a component model and micro-service architecture inspired by OSGi and Eclipse's extension points, an SQL-based content repository, a rich set of features to make it possible to create specialized content applications out of the building blocks provided by the platform. In 2011, the Nuxeo EP project became an OW2 project. In this talk, we will present the architecture, features and roadmap for the project, and learn how to leverage it to build content-centric business applications, on traditional application servers or on the Cloud.

	00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:10,190
and I'm going to present you the open

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,110
stores next your platform which is a

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,330
platform for business application for

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,350
content centric business application so

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,800
the company was founded 11 years ago

00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:25,350
it's about 40 plus employees now a dual

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,510
presence in the in France and in the US

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,850
and we are a recent member of w-2 we

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,430
join at the beginning of the year we are

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,129
also member of Eclipse Foundation a

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,309
contributor to chew Apache project and

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,320
members of systemic cap digital and plus

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,840
the Paris cluster for open-source

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,879
companies so I'm going to we are going

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,620
to talk mainly about the next year

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,370
platform but it's important to

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,649
understand all the platform fits within

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,590
the open so the next CEO solution

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,530
portfolio so you've got the basic

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,080
building blocks of technology which we

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,460
call the platform then we've got several

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,810
distribution a packaging of this

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,880
platform and then we provide three what

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,100
we call Horizonte our applications or

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,700
generic document management application

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,360
or multimedia document management

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:31,229
application and then some other people

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,630
or partners are developing a vertical

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,060
application specific application or they

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,210
are developing completely bespoke

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,340
application for their own internal use

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,829
of other customers where when there are

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,869
systems integrators and of course we

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:53,100
have a service offering from maintenance

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:54,990
support and an online ide and a

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,930
marketplace for all the third-party

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,149
contributions so what is the next your

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,450
platform it's a set of building blocks

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:08,459
and these building blocks are used to

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,229
create several different applications so

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,300
on the left you've got the default

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,550
interface for next your document

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,220
management and on the right you've got

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,230
the default interface for the digital

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,120
asset management application these are

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,840
two different applications but they are

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,630
based on largely common blocks so the

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,180
platform provides a set of services a

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,630
set of technical services but that are

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,880
of course focused on or on a domain the

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,220
enterprise content management domain so

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,110
we start document we have workflows on

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,790
document we've got of course surgeons

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,560
indexing security etc we also provide

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,010
building blocks for you I so everything

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,280
in the next user interface is actually

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,190
declared using a declarative language

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,000
and can be customized or you can use

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,090
also the default template language to

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,870
create your application with the with

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,180
mac co we provide several high-level

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:15,270
frameworks and we provide as i said

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,060
several prepackaged business

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,670
applications so what's in it for you if

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:26,280
you're a Java developer you can use

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:28,040
nexeo by using its service at api's you

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,410
have support for several client

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:37,050
technologies from desktop web to mobile

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:41,280
web to rich Internet application or SCP

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,370
based application everything is modular

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,900
using a plug-in system which is based on

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,239
osgi and we also provide the several

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,720
testing framework including and unique

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,910
testing framework and if you're a

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,420
systems integrator if you don't want to

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,280
program that much in Java but really

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,340
want just to assemble the building

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,360
blocks so you can configure nexeo using

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,340
XML files or using an online

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,470
configuration tool or you can use the

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,310
web services that PAP is to integrate

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,290
Luxio with other parts of the your

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,229
information system and of course with

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,660
support several standards including the

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,360
same is the content management

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,590
interoperability standard

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,009
or the OpenSocial standard for social

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:37,240
applications we also provide tools build

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:39,610
tools based on maven two different kinds

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,289
of development tools one which is for

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,319
systems integrator which is web-based

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,389
and we call it nexeo studio and the

00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,819
other one which is quite resin recent it

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,460
was released at the beginning of the

00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:54,370
month and we call it an axial ide and

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,830
it's based on Eclipse and then several

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,050
testing tool some of them you can use

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,849
even outside of neck zero like the

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:08,710
popular front load web testing tool

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:11,189
maybe you want to take over ok so the

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,800
content triple sorry that's our main job

00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,349
basically but I'm going to explain what

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,430
I documents well you could see a

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:23,500
document just as a as one file does the

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,099
next part or you can see it in nexeo as

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,449
a file with several metadata for

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,479
instance we have the creation data

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,690
modification date the other address the

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:40,599
lifecycle etc so that's what we stored

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:43,690
in anoxia this documents can be seen as

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,729
a set of schemas and in a schema you

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,729
have all your metadata like a date or

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:53,770
any string or boolean or double integral

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:55,750
whatever yeah so suppose inheritance so

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,550
you have common documents and then you

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,960
have a file that's extending kind of

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,819
document you have a note document that

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,219
extends documents etc and to each

00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:09,099
document you can associate a life cycle

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:11,589
for instance the default I've circle you

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,199
create a document project state and then

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:18,430
you can delete it so it's in the deleted

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:22,930
state the other thing about the document

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,279
is it can have facets it's it can be

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,960
justified for instance we have the

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,539
folder if asset which means the document

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,750
can contains contains all the documents

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:36,310
or you could associate different schemas

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,270
we facet he also she bought mix-ins well

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,530
the different between

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:44,890
certain mixing is you can add mixing

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,540
during the life of a document it doesn't

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,360
have to start with the with the facet

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:54,400
you can edit whenever you want doing its

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,370
life cycle we also provide security

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,320
features based on ACL that access

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,670
control lists and plug of all security

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,940
policy for instance if you want to base

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,920
your security on the document metadata

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,480
instead of the usual ACL with users and

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,430
groups and permissions so once you've

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,160
stored all these documents internet co

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,650
the what you provide of course is a way

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,690
to get them to search them so we have

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,450
two different gravity system the

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:30,910
original one was a Nazi oql and then we

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:33,490
have the CM SQL so lets you search for

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,030
keywords or also do full text search

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:41,560
depending on what databases you use with

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:45,430
next year you can also use reporting

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,100
whispered because everything in EXO is

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,930
stored in a secure database so it's not

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,060
well we used to use this yards like a

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,150
black box but Nick CEO we use VCS

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,300
something that we've developed that is

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,870
way more transparent than was this year

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,260
so you can plug any control reporting

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:10,120
tool you want we also provide versioning

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,950
features very basics like you can

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,110
configure the policy or how you want to

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,910
throw the different versions so if I do

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,500
a manual incrementation so we use us on

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:26,760
00 version you will be on 0 1 version

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:30,670
and all of this is configurable and so

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,400
to store all that I said we use a VCS

00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:38,950
for visible cotton store which means

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,050
native situa and we basically you can

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,260
plug any database you want so we provide

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,380
only for a moment's passed vesicle

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,340
Oracle may ask

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,370
ms equal h2o and early as the default

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,460
database but you could plug maybe go

00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:00,380
Debbie or any other no secure database

00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,480
you want we also have a storage adapter

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,830
so when you scroll binary the next CEO

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,440
is that I'm usually on the tax system

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,570
you can also store them on s3 or you

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,880
could store them on anything you want to

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:18,590
just have to write the storage adapter

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,260
for that oops okay I'll be quick on the

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,780
advanced features a bid for performance

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,460
Sofia we with VCS you have lazy loading

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,930
prefetching cash in the blood streaming

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,670
so that's so that all the API is you use

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,390
already take care of that you don't have

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:39,110
to do it do this we have transaction

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,990
management and even system that you can

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:47,300
plug for instance on on JMS the java

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:52,120
messaging service we and all a snapshot

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,050
of your VCS end of the data

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,000
automatically application that means

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,730
that every binary will put next year

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,540
will have footprints and so you won't

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,430
have any double yawn in your database

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,630
and you can do a hot back up with Nick

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,280
saw something that's pretty pretty cool

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,560
so that was the concerns repository now

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,690
you can see nexeo as a platform as a

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,540
service platform so the different way

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,220
you you have to use next few you have

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,390
all of the data API the command Java API

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:33,260
you are also after whoops services API

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:36,110
so we have Java all rest for with the

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:40,210
jax-rs of soap web service with jax-ws

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:47,860
or even a MF and flash with we choose a

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:50,720
granite data services and so that's the

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,810
service API and we have some more

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,850
content oriented API for instance about

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:59,080
you have stiffened talked about this cm

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,680
is you can use you can use a new clothes

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,900
as a windows sharepoint server or you

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,560
can use web dev to put your documents on

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,500
next year and then that's something that

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,090
we've developed because we won't want it

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,950
to have something easier a bit more high

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,700
level than the all the rest api so we

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:22,930
have the automation api basically it's

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:25,830
an automation chain is a set of small

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,810
operations on small units of other

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,660
business code that you can change with

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,320
trousers and then call using the REST

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,020
API or using an axial studio which is

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,290
