okay so i'm christian pattinson hello

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,000
head of open-source governance for the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,220
orange group today I'm here launching

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,090
the open-source accessibility initiative

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,380
within o w2 and really I want to tell

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,279
you about what is that open-source

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,399
accessibility initiative what are we

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,219
doing our what are the drivers and where

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,649
we're trying to go with this obviously

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,410
open source we know the benefits

00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:42,510
benefits to code benefits to road maps

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,399
but of course we mustn't forget the

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,610
aspect of open source which is maybe the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,559
most important which is the aspect of

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,039
community the community of working

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,480
together of collaborating of

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:59,070
participating and of leaving code for

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,500
others to use and share in our

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,570
experiences our skills and I think this

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,760
very closely ties in with the notion of

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,590
accessibility and in fact if you think

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,810
of accessibility if you think talk to

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,939
access about accessibility to most

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,220
developers the first thing that will

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,380
come to mind is access to code but of

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,420
course there's a much larger issue

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,110
involved when we think of accessibility

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,509
which is the access to products to

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,990
services or the access to our workplace

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,750
and this of course is the classic

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,439
understanding of accessibility with

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:37,079
visual impairments auditory impairments

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,290
physical impairments mental impairments

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,869
cognitive difficulties I like the last

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,850
one cognitive difficulties it makes you

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,500
makes us sound like we have a medical

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,040
condition but of course we all have

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,860
cognitive difficulties we're all

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,880
multitasking and how can we make life

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,549
easier and that nicely ties in as well

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,680
with the notion of accessibility of do

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,560
we have to do something special or are

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,140
we in fact trying to improve the

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,860
usability of our products or services

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,650
for everyone

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,800
and that's a key messages dealing with

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,530
accessibility is something that improves

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,500
the access of our code of our products

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:24,400
or services for everyone is designed for

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,410
all in New us is twenty-two percent of

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,810
the population judged by the center of

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,810
Disease Control which equates roughly

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,020
depending on the statistic you read to

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,990
about 63 million people within the USA

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,630
with some kind of impairment or

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,610
disability if you look globally the

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,140
world health organization estimates that

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,970
at 1 billion people these huge numbers

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,350
and and you know what these are huge

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,239
numbers that are going to increase

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,610
because of changing demographics the

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,910
world is getting older we're living

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:03,910
longer in just a few years within the EU

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:07,150
one quarter of the population will be

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,480
over the age of 60 which is like just a

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,430
huge number huge staggering statistic

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,500
when you think about all the

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,810
difficulties that creates in terms of

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,810
accessibility so usability means

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,989
designed for all catering for everyone

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,690
good population and this creates a huge

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:30,510
business opportunity behind it as well

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:34,030
ofcourse the social impact and the legal

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,269
responsibilities so on the business side

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,910
of course 1 billion people is quite a

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,580
large population it's a large population

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,930
of people for our workplace who are

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,180
going to have ideas are going to have

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,650
innovations it's a large population of

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,590
people who are going to join our

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,170
communities and give us feedback it's a

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:57,459
large population of people who will use

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,670
our products and our services from a

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,730
pure purchasing viewpoint know that I

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,360
want to focus on the monetary side of it

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:10,299
but a pur purchase in viewpoint the 63

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,299
million people in New us who have a

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,630
physical disability cognitive disability

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:19,539
a disability of some kind it's estimated

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,629
they have a purchasing power of 175

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:25,930
billion dollars

00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:27,520
and that's just the u.s. okay so open

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,229
source accessibility initiative is

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,340
really leveraging the open source

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,840
framework and of course leveraging the

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,889
power and the framework and a

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,849
recognition of 0 w to to bring together

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:46,629
incredible people projects guideline

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:49,270
experiences into one organization the

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:53,050
coordinate stays in order to move

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,099
everyone forward and I hope you can join

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,099
