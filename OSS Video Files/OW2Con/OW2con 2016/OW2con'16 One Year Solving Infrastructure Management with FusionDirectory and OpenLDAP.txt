Title: OW2con'16 One Year Solving Infrastructure Management with FusionDirectory and OpenLDAP
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Today the world of infrastructure moves. the advent of cloud, Infrastructure on demand, SAS mode are innovative concepts requiring a change in our methods. But what about managing these platforms, security, systems and users. The infrastructure is not necessarily internal anymore, establishing a workflow has become indispensable. The Daily operations by less skilled people and the delegation of operations. At this conference we will see on concrete cases and details how FusionDirectory daily support to solve these problems thanks to its modularity, its API, and webservices.

hello everybody yeah I will talk about

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:17,220
oh we help company to manage the dead

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,000
guy inside in companies Oh to build new

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,269
infrastructure on directories why is it

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,510
so hard to do it without the proper

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:39,540
tools but first some some I losing my

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:43,200
body and some IDs separating for chapter

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,070
how to manage attorneys infrastructure

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,410
what's fusion directory Oh to integrate

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,870
external software because we have a lot

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,890
of software to have to manipulate data

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,410
inside or outside of the Red array so we

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,510
need some tool through that and some use

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,090
case so the first challenge today when

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,680
you want to manage infrastructure is

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,950
that you have lots of device everywhere

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,770
of every kind in there are more and more

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,380
every day so you are no longer in the

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,530
happy world well we will have one type

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,009
of computer one type of s and then it's

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,229
happy you do it with one software so now

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,900
you have to manage lots of complexity

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,090
now you have the cloud is used so you

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,329
have lots of software outside of the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,759
company meaning if you have clout you

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,610
lose some of the integration you lose

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,159
the control on the account most of the

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,759
time you have to reimport your account

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,759
outside it's some kind of nightmare very

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,259
difficult to activate icon to follow

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,170
with us in without it's not that easy

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,450
make it simple so also you need

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,759
someplace to centralize all this

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,369
information and you want this

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,940
information to be inside your company

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,430
not outside and not separated several

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,450
part of some account here some occurred

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,849
here summer

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,940
on this cloud and cermak on there but

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,370
when someone asked me can I remove that

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,290
I don't know I don't know to do it so

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,349
you have to centralize everything and

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,330
have some kind of control center I can

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,930
interact with the other software and

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,819
push or get back info to have one

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,709
centralized point to have all your

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,799
information in and you have militated of

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:44,280
tools and it makes stuff very difficult

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:47,160
to manage what I called the poor system

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,319
mean 200 tabs in these browsers because

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,540
you have this application for this one

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,980
and another tab to manage this one and

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,190
another application to manage this

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,650
application and so and so and so on so

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:02,010
most of the time I combs stay in the

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,099
system even two year after people left

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,709
you still see I can't oh they have

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,690
access to your accounting system oh yes

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,019
we forgot to remove the account yes it's

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,840
normally if you have 200 or maybe 10 20

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,480
or 30 application to manage the accesses

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,639
we will lose some we will forget some

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,290
it's nearly impossible to manage or so

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,139
the first one it's the classical one

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,060
because most of the people tell me oh

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:36,510
ldap it's for user and groups no we are

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,850
under 21 century you can put more than

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,410
user and group in your directory it's

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,389
made to do it so please yes you can

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,880
enrich your ldap server and you can put

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,700
lots of that and it it's it's made for

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,250
that and you can extend the Shema so I

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,889
can question I good often yes it's

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,220
designed to put Newsham I it's not

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,069
nightmare it's designed to do that and

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,700
then you have the second one it's a more

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:09,389
and more you want to delegate to other

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,549
people to work you don't want to be the

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,220
only season me know the two season mean

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,169
that everybody calls then I need an

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,849
account I need to reset my password can

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,829
you create an account for this guy oh

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:23,550
this guy is leaving can you remove the

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,270
second no you have to make it flow and

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,270
have several people

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,720
underload and it's rather easy if you

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,569
can do that then you need an interface

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,930
to organize and display the data because

00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:41,949
one of the biggest difficulties with

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,789
ldap server is days mainly no nice

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:50,669
interface to manage the data and I mean

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:54,039
nice nice being a normal human being

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,470
should be able to manage the data it

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,190
should not be so difficult it should not

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,500
be so cryptic it should be nice and

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,900
every level of people should be able to

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,000
manage the data inside company if they

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,699
got the right to do so so it should be

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,819
nice and should not be the green yellow

00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,889
blue I don't know which color made by

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,979
the onions is that only one people can

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,229
manager if it's the best effect

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:24,750
everybody's dead because nobody can

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:27,969
manage the data anymore and the last one

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,150
integrate data from other source in and

00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:34,000
out because you don't want to have some

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:40,330
kind of Silla somewhere and not be able

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,520
to put data inside so that's before

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,060
fusion directory you have normally

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,210
specialized interface to insert the data

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,340
so you have some kind of interface with

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,190
your user stuff our group stuff and

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,860
every kind of interface is kind of

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,800
specialized in doing one or two think

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,930
it's nice but if you want sunrise and

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,650
give access to other people it's not

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,419
useful at all some are toolkits oh they

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,779
are nice but you have to design the

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,330
world interface by yourself so you lose

00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:16,060
you get some flexibility but you lose

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,180
some time and some manpower to do an

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,500
interface that manage your kind of doing

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:26,080
the thing and still if you do that there

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,990
is still no interface to manage to work

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,310
complexity of the infrastructure meaning

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,620
user groups accounts system deploying

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,210
stuff everything come with its own

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:43,009
interfaces it's kind of difficult

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:46,100
and then confusion directly the

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,710
philosophy behind the software is an

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,160
interface to manage everything the idea

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,759
is I have only one interface and I do

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,509
everything inside this interface and I

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,389
do it always the same way for example in

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,759
fuel injector if you manage a user it's

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,400
always done the same way if you manage

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,889
the system is the same kind of way of

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,110
doing it if your system is windows linux

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,539
clothes everything it's the same way of

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,270
doing things so if you know how to do

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:20,270
one thing you can know how to do the

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,820
rest it's not that difficult the second

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,419
one is very important preska most of the

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:29,240
time you got oh you got a nice software

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,820
okay but to integrate with me you have

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,460
to change these days and that and then

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,500
you get a broken software because it

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,960
makes you move so many parts that your

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,080
software doesn't work anymore so we have

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,419
taken the other approach is we integrate

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,970
we as out of software but we don't

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:50,599
change anything in the software that

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:54,259
connect to us or where we connect so we

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:57,710
adapt to the software and then you need

00:07:54,259 --> 00:08:00,169
some kind of molarity infusion directory

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,330
everything is a plugin you have the car

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,849
and then you have ton of plugins for

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,770
values functionality each time you want

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,500
to add a new functionality you're right

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,759
a plug so that's rather easy you can

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,099
install just unique and then bits by

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,849
bits at the other functionality you want

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:22,750
and we have a web services so you can

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:25,820
talk to the West web services it's like

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,880
playing with the web interface in it

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,830
respect every kind of system in South

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,529
with one directory but you do that by

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,510
your web services that's a big bonus but

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,839
because most of the time people write

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,300
script and script guru still 32 the ldap

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,860
server please write this object last

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,010
disturb disturb district oh it's broken

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,329
for the record one day one of our

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:55,500
customer just erased 70 VIP people in

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:58,140
the morning at 8am it's white a little

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,570
bit touchy because yeah you have people

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:05,190
coming in the office so when the script

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:08,610
go rogue it's not nice so that's the

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,279
interface yes it's not so lively like

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,640
that but you can see that has three

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:19,589
parts user and group system and then

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:23,250
some configuration and some report it's

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:26,480
very functional software it's mean to be

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,579
used daily with lots of functionalities

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,790
creating user group and rose creating

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,130
functional areas lots of other plugin so

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,230
standard password management p policy

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,320
management for people who knows ldap so

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,070
password policy with history exploration

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,680
and stuff like that we have also some

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,620
nice stuff we have template for example

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,440
you can create templates and then apply

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,810
templates when creating user so you can

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,570
create the user exactly the way you want

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,209
I want my password to be like that i

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,769
want my user ID to be like that i want

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:04,079
to home like that i want to mate like

00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:07,380
that so you can create a template for

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,350
making users and we use it most of the

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,230
time to make different level users this

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,589
is a season mean this is a def this is a

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,920
IT guy this is a classical guy so you

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:22,230
can create lots of turf with templates

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,940
we have also effectively bulk import and

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:31,320
you can grab CSV apply a template and

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,250
create 2,000 user like that we have

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,029
something that's very nice it's snapshot

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,459
we can snap shot every object store

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,350
inside the ldap server with Filan

00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,600
directory so you you have a very

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:50,100
important people you create a snapshot

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,680
each snapshot the user some part on the

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,319
directory you make your change oh I make

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,500
a mistake you get back your snapshot and

00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:00,170
it put back

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,890
entry the way to us that's very nice in

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:06,830
every day your everyday routine and you

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:11,510
can store as many snapshot as you want

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:14,870
it's very useful then as I say we do a

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:18,020
lot of other stuff we do system

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:21,350
management but not in the config

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:25,070
management space the first part is we

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:28,250
store in Saudi ldap all who serve all

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,430
the dinners own all the dhcp stuff and

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,710
we can create phone via phone mobile

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,350
phone and everything so we put that

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,350
inside the server ldap server like

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,950
object and then we can connect to

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,350
deployment tools that's the second part

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,170
we deploy with fi he told all this one

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,800
for deploying linux box of see's for

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,980
windows box debconf it for Debian we

00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:00,200
also have a back-end for puppet and more

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:03,430
as adept as time goes and then we can

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,740
also do classical management as

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:11,839
restarting service getting the statue of

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:15,980
services and stuff like that and that's

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,890
the integration so the first one is the

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,750
one has just talked about we have vision

00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,780
directory and then you have argonauts

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,620
argonaut is some kind of agra noticed

00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,930
some kind of client server system so fit

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,580
on deck to restore everything and then

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,610
film director I talk to are gonna

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,100
telling him please refresh my desk then

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,550
assume that's there please install this

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,180
box please stop this and these services

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,370
or restart those boxes and then it can

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,180
do lots of stuff as you can see a

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,490
courtesy embouchure run task scheduled

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,890
task and stuff like that I bet it's very

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,940
light it's written in perl it's very

00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,700
light and it's you can load at startup

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,710
module so you can write new models that

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,480
get loaded start up for the

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,850
functionality you wants that's the

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,579
second part that's interesting

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,389
everything inside is on the rectory it's

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:21,680
made with our own API so the API does

00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:27,829
everything screen related so drop down

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:32,120
and everything it's also managed or a CL

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:36,319
system jasiel system allows you to say

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,800
these people can only update is personal

00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:43,040
mail address so we have a 10 on a cell

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,250
system that allows you to decide what

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,959
people can do inside software and it's

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,630
easy to understand you can write a

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,509
plug-in in less than one hour you have

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:57,529
full documentation it's really easy to

00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:00,769
do and then the last one is the web

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:04,459
services the web services do the same as

00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:07,699
clicking in the web interface you can

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,889
create object it respect vision

00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:13,519
directory access excel and access right

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:15,949
and its support functionality like model

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,040
templates so you can see through the web

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:21,649
services please create me a user with

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,410
this template and this data and it will

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:28,670
create you exactly as you have click in

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:30,680
the Indian to face your user it's rather

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,800
easy to understand its classic GC

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,430
episodes documented and with a little

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,170
twist we also have the same one on

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:42,259
console called fusion down to a shell

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:45,230
for people doing SSH and not having

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,939
access to the web interface film

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,740
director I shall just use a web service

00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:51,560
but you have a check you have a shell

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,079
you can ask please give me the number of

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,509
user with this attribute or please rate

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:01,060
me a user with distribute it will do the

00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:05,420
same so the web service is every use and

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,110
trucks this one you know it's over to I

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,709
we have done some development and they

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,740
are using the the web services for some

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:17,930
functionality right now so they use X

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,050
wiki and from X wiki they use web

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:24,100
service to create the basic user right

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,889
now so it's a living proof that

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,019
the web service is working they used

00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:33,130
that for the reset password and to

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:36,130
remind the name of the user this one is

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,350
one from the award this one is really

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:42,269
nice because it's they wanted to

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,680
centralize everything but they have d 10

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,389
separate location around the country

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,430
with non IT guys only scientists and

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:54,130
those people have the responsibility to

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:57,040
create user on groups and put user and

00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:01,389
in groups so they can access a software

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,639
that's running or nationally so that's

00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:07,810
this one is really nice because they use

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:10,870
the AV user of templates so they force

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,930
the local user the first the local user

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,630
to use the templates so they have some

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,149
kind of control and some kind of

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,389
delegation so they can do stuff lambent

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:25,180
by themselves we made for them that's in

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:28,000
the release I noted plugins so we now

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:31,630
have a noted plugin thats stolen to ldap

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,009
each action that's done i have this user

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:38,759
as modified this a user and you can

00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,230
click and see what's been modified and

00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,560
the second one is really nice too its

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,470
kind of user reminder it's for when

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,439
people leaving or people forgetting they

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,009
can send mail your account will be will

00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:55,990
expire in 10 days so will you want to

00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:58,360
after account after those these days

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,660
with link to the manager and stuff like

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,260
that it's it's really nice stuff this

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:09,939
one is for the external stuff they have

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,620
made some kind of not so kind of plugin

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:14,530
with some care of scripts they go to

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,409
Google Apps they get all the data and

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,360
then they create the user inside fusion

00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:23,110
directory because the company is using

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,620
google apps and so they wanted some kind

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,659
of directory server inside the company

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,480
for samba share and stuff like that the

00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,210
classical stuff so they use few next

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,220
directory web services they go to Google

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,350
Apps get the data and crew

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,260
to user inside reason directory with the

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,260
web services and then they have user to

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,559
connect to the sandbar sharon and sun

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:52,120
and ness and stuff like that and this

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,350
one is on one of the biggest one it's in

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:59,799
elko i stick to the longer here on Tyler

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:02,140
Nia for me down the big bibliothèque and

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,960
stuff like that and this one is

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:09,870
important because we take the database

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:13,780
from the education we put them to go to

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:18,000
Japan with the norm for the education we

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:20,950
made the trade three they allow you

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,320
student to change mobile email and then

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,750
they push back the data to the education

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:32,200
database so whoever workflow to do it

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:37,510
it's more than 8,000 students and doing

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,900
that Tanner and I'm done is there some

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,900
