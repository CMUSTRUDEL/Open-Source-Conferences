Title: OW2con'16 AppHub & Oscar: Fostering Market Readiness at OW2
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	AppHub is the European Open Source marketplace. Open source software is a powerful enabler for collaborative innovation. However, making the source available does not automatically attract contributors or grant immediate market access. AppHub's mission is to help users find and implement the software outcomes of your open source projects more easily. AppHub is designed to make it easier for open source projects to connect with their potential markets.

This presentation will provide an overview of AppHub since its launch early last year. We will review the services offered to open source projects for exposing their outcome to the market, using a template factory for packaging their software, and also for assessing their market readiness, using the Oscar platform provided by OW2. We will also show how end users can use AppHub for deploying pre-configured open source projects to the virtual or cloud format of their choice, and how AppHub will evolve to a marketplace for the OW2 projects beyond the end of the EU project itself.
