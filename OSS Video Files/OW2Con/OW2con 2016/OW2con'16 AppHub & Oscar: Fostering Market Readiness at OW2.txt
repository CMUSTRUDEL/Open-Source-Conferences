Title: OW2con'16 AppHub & Oscar: Fostering Market Readiness at OW2
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	AppHub is the European Open Source marketplace. Open source software is a powerful enabler for collaborative innovation. However, making the source available does not automatically attract contributors or grant immediate market access. AppHub's mission is to help users find and implement the software outcomes of your open source projects more easily. AppHub is designed to make it easier for open source projects to connect with their potential markets.

This presentation will provide an overview of AppHub since its launch early last year. We will review the services offered to open source projects for exposing their outcome to the market, using a template factory for packaging their software, and also for assessing their market readiness, using the Oscar platform provided by OW2. We will also show how end users can use AppHub for deploying pre-configured open source projects to the virtual or cloud format of their choice, and how AppHub will evolve to a marketplace for the OW2 projects beyond the end of the EU project itself.

	00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:12,509
this morning Cedric reminded us that one

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,969
of actually the resin death of a w-2 is

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,930
its code base obviously the project and

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,170
there could be owing the code itself

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,090
another core idea at the original the

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,939
other body tooth consortium is to also

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,369
to promote the market readiness and to

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,009
support it off the other value to

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,860
project of this code base so as to meet

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,940
the market requirements and to strive on

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:45,090
the open source software market this is

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:48,899
why in 2010 a w-2 as introduced a

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,160
program called squad together with the

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,039
concept of major projects squat was then

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,910
standing for software quality assurance

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,789
and trustworthiness and earlier this

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,920
year it became Oscar which stands for

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:10,650
open source software capability

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:14,580
assessment radar this Oscar program is

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,759
here to facilitate the adoption of the

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,540
other value to projects by the market by

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,759
highlighting key criteria that we

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,900
consider extremely useful in the

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:32,790
decision-making process so today Oscar

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,720
is a framework that is here to help you

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,360
as project leaders your Aloma and others

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,670
breno that is here to help you project

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,720
leaders together with a w-2 management

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,780
office to continuously progress on this

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,509
path toward market readiness and

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,840
maturity which is always all the more

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,170
demanding it and recently been Walcott's

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,710
mature mature bait but may became a

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,790
major project so you can see it as a

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,649
framework which consists of first set of

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,210
quality assessment tools that i will

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,250
present later on and

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,600
also something like you can see as a

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,230
check list of recommended best practices

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,660
for successful open source product right

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:26,190
not only project with products major

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:30,100
products so how does it work really

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,680
first of all Oscar is both a quality

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,560
model and the platform the quality model

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,500
is called omm open source maturity model

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:43,780
and the platform you can see it as a way

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,820
to implement this model so as to get to

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,790
measure the criteria to fit the model

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,370
and to see where your project here is in

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,390
terms of maturity compared to the matter

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,850
as you can see on this diagram oscar has

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,310
two main pillars that we call the

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,840
governance pillow and the engineering

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,480
pillar each pillar comprises a set of

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,510
thematic criteria that are represented

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,360
on this diagram by the blue boxes while

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,660
the orange boxes represent the tools

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,310
that we are setting that we set up and

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,440
we maintain on the audible you to

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,660
collaborative engineering platform to

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:29,110
help you measure all these criteria the

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,410
governance belong comprises teams

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,710
sections the licensing and IP management

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,750
aspects the standards compliance e of

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,900
your product with existing industry

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,870
standards the way it conforms with

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,420
privacy and that data protection rules

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,240
and the way it deals with requirements

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,280
roadmaps and documentation the

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,530
engineering peel obviously focus is more

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,620
on technological aspects a chance the

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,560
way the project managers code issues

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,150
commits the way it implements a

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,210
continuous integration the way it

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,330
analyzes the code to detect to to

00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,630
analyze it it's its quality and more

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,490
recently the clouds what we call the

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,820
cloud deployment readiness and that we

00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:19,510
will present later on through other one

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:22,419
of the benefits of Oscar is illustrated

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,450
at the top of the Jagdish diagram this

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,780
is the

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,050
the fact that Oscar converts all the

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,840
measurements gathered by the tools into

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:37,910
what we call high-level scorecards that

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:41,810
is dashboards and scores really which

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:47,630
hillis traits she quit cookies kiss

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:49,790
cause for assessing me treating what

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,490
does it look like such a scorecard you

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:56,000
can see one here for the proactive

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,400
parallel sweet this is an outcome of EU

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
research project called riscos and you

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,840
can see here that the adopted approach

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,390
emphasizes three key scores one coverage

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,250
license cookies license call another one

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,760
is the quality score and the last one is

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,060
the activeness score all these scores

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,970
are computed from the tools that we have

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,630
set up on the platform and by come back

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,780
by applying a risk model or on a more

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:31,280
positive tone maturity or market

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,580
readiness model to the measurements such

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,580
a risk model can actually be defined on

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,430
the platform itself so that you can

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,440
declare what's important for you in

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,140
terms of market readiness so we have

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,940
defined the other value to risk model

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,010
which defines first of all the set of

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,470
normalized intervals for each

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,620
measurements each type of measurement

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,380
and also set of functions that compute

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,690
this course given the low level

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,420
measurement I want to enter into the

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,280
details of the computation but we I can

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:09,200
show it to you later on I will now

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,020
describe briefly the tools themselves

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,700
the quality tools that you can see here

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,400
as a list of reports together with the

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,130
links to the data collected by vital

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,320
tools the one for dealing with licensing

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,220
historically that we use so far is for

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,070
solutia project initiated by hpn manage

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,550
today within the linux foundation the

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,860
one that we use for static analysis is

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,180
so not cube we also use opener

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,730
since last year to measure activeness

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:47,460
and we use the self declarative forms

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,380
for open the open maturity model let me

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,630
show you a quick look of the dashboards

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,600
that gather all these metrics you can

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,790
see three tabs your licensing code

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,760
quality and activeness the licensing tab

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:03,120
shows the metric extracted from and by

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,490
force ology such as the number of

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,600
distinct license is found in the code or

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,600
the number of fights without license the

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,800
the metrics computed by sonarqube are

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,280
presented on the second tab such as a

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,080
single line of code and the major

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,229
breakage in code conventions are

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,360
transported by the tool and here you can

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:32,669
see both open app activity scores and

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,710
scores resulted from the open-source

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,560
matrix model form that i will show you

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,789
hear that the open source majority model

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:46,020
web forms are a set of 80 questions in

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:50,100
major chapters helping the projects you

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,110
drew check where they are with general

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,080
best practices for open source software

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,840
project and as you can see at the bottom

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,729
of this slide we introduced in these

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,680
serpents of matrix model this year

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:05,970
through a pipe that Alex will present in

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,160
a second a chapter section covering how

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:12,330
far the project is in terms of

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,419
continuously generating cloud images and

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,030
for how many cloud technologies in sync

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,860
or not with the release cycle of the

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,750
software is the obvious disease is

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,150
becoming a major aspect for me during

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,150
the the maturity of a product to

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,110
understand how far it is with cloud

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:33,930
deployment automation and this is why I

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,300
will end over now to Alex because a pub

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,120
that Alex with Alex and will describe is

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,860
a major a w-2 tool together with

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,830
partners for supporting these cloud

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,140
deployment readiness right so how does

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,520
up hope fit with the Oscar program in

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,440
terms of cloud the common reading is

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,410
just just a few words on a profit

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,020
also technically speaking I Pope is an H

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,720
2020 support action which lasts 24

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,160
months so it started in January last

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,820
year and will end at the end of this

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,550
year it has three partners being from

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,930
offer focuses you reached it around yes

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:13,050
Oh W to which is here and you shaft and

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,490
the goal of a prob why was it financed

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,780
by the European Commission the goal was

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,280
to help the EU supported open source

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,560
projects to meet what they call the

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,280
delivered challenge so in other words

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,200
the EU spends a lot of money on you

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,840
project who claim they will deliver code

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,550
in open source two weeks before the end

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,080
of the project some parisa woo we have

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,660
to do open source they dumped the code

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,890
on sourceforge a month later the

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,200
project's finished the websites

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,420
disappeared the code is there nobody can

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,970
use it so that's two skema ties so what

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,770
what do you wanted is to really make the

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,620
give the projects and tools to support

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,720
them so that they can truly deliver the

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,000
code in a way that's practically usable

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,980
by the end user so it's also available

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,370
for the wiki project as we will see in a

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,860
minute the URL is here I hope that you

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,420
calm it's self service everybody can

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,660
create an account you can create an

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,900
account not only to upload your project

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,610
but also if you want to consume so if

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:16,110
you want to use the projects you can

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:18,570
create an account so so for or WT

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,620
project in particular and as part of

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,840
Oscar so up hub is and will remain after

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,120
the end of the upper project dow2 cell

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,710
service cloud deployment platform so

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,350
compared to a number of marketplaces

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,390
that you can see on the left one of the

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,640
key major differences of our pub is that

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:39,089
it's truly multi-technology so we will

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,860
offer you the possibility to generate as

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,060
well to first to package your project

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,650
results in the way that it's fully

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,660
configured with the right configuration

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,610
environment rather than just having a

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,680
website with a binary and installation

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,470
instructions and the user struggle so

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,940
you package it as a template that same

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,820
template as I showed you before with

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,680
hammer it's pretty multi-cloud

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,750
multi-technology so we offer a wide

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,529
range of different operating systems

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,660
where you can package your

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:08,259
where it's truly self-service as

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,149
compared to other marketplaces anybody

00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:13,089
who has a project can create an account

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,529
as a project and expose their results so

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,689
it's not only self-service for the

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,120
consumer but also for the quad code

00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:22,209
vendor for the producer and it

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,269
integrates with the audibility Oscar as

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,399
defined as mentioned before and for WT

00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,769
project you also benefit of course from

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,269
the audibility governance through the

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:35,949
technology canceled etcetera etcetera so

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,509
very briefly how does it work so if

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,550
you're a project at the bottom if you're

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,620
a producer you have basically two tools

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,050
1 2 which is what we call the upper

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,480
factory where you can package the

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,220
project result in a similar form as I

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,809
presented earlier as a templates you

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,579
choose the operating system you upload

00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,249
your binaries you add your configuration

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:57,370
script you can find choose the OS

00:11:54,249 --> 00:12:00,249
packages if you have any any particular

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,959
dependencies you can you can try

00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:04,029
deployments you generate any machine

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,309
image to any format you try it out once

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,480
you're confident it works you go from

00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,490
the left hand side to the right hand

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,939
side so you publish it to the store you

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,860
make it visible so that every everybody

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:17,319
but we want to use it so that's the

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,110
consumer can go to the store discover

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,879
what you've exposed and themselves they

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,610
can generate an image format to

00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,459
whichever format there need to be able

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,399
to use it and also a third category of

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,829
actors is the cloud service provider so

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,529
if you're a user of a project and you

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:38,019
want to use it in your internal IT you

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:40,120
can download the image if you have an

00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,309
account in an external cloud provider

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,699
you can also publish it to this account

00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:47,740
so in terms of the cloud don't get cloud

00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:51,459
of vm formats and each other is early on

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:55,779
so we cover we try to cover the maximum

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:59,519
number of formats this yeah at the

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:02,309
moment we believe apart from ibm's

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:08,379
proprietary format on top of OpenStack

00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:10,120
which is so got the name anyway a profit

00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,259
la one we suppose we try to support them

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,350
all

00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:17,869
aim the user of the the consumer of a

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,799
pop can register is cloud credentials

00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:23,089
he's got one any of those platforms and

00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,609
for the cloud providers so at the moment

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,350
we've engaged through a probe to your

00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:30,350
recruitment of cloud providers who want

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,889
to expose their platform as one other

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,079
preferred platform so of course through

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:39,470
cloudstack we already showed you stack

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:45,410
we have dreamhost now so who's a company

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:47,869
who provides cloud as on top of

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,139
OpenStack so that's dreamhost a nikola

00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:53,539
who's offering a public cloud offering

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,939
in france based on CloudStack and of

00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,009
course we do support microsoft azure

00:13:55,939 --> 00:14:00,350
amazon web services google compute and

00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:04,579
we're in discussion with ex alto as well

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,549
who's a Grenoble cloud provider to see

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,019
whether we could integrate them so the

00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,729
number of open due to projects already

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:14,419
available on app hope so this is the

00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:18,230
list you can check it out so we've we've

00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:20,749
cheated a bit because I believe that we

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,269
are prompted them all so but but we

00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:25,039
encourage every except with cliff and I

00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,709
did work with the Bruno there to do the

00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,309
cliff template and otherwise we

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:35,019
encourage every owt project to publish

00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:37,039
their own templates in the apple store

00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,100
you want to take the conclusions

00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,019
different sure thank you Alex so now

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,269
regarding a pipe and the other bit

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,859
marketplace that the idea is to get

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,139
feedback from you project leaders

00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:51,019
transition what you would dream of in

00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:53,809
terms of marketplace cloud-ready or

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,939
cloud platform so as to refine the

00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:58,639
requirements of the of this platform and

00:14:55,939 --> 00:15:00,829
to derive a real business model rounded

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,470
so as to grow the revenues of your

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,959
products of course so we'll be happy

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,059
with lx2 to show you a further a demo

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:11,199
later to run on today thank you or

00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,199
tomorrow thank you very much

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,790
