Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	ActiveEon is an Open Source ISV offering automation and scalability solutions for IT, Big Data and Internet of Things to accelerate, automate and scale their business processes and reduce their infrastructure cost.
ActiveEon recently worked with two customers in very different areas:
- INRA, the French National Institute for agronomics, in order to integrate a portal dedicated to metagenomics analysis. ActiveEon’s ProActive accelerates the treatments of more than 500 terabytes of metagenomics data per year in R language, and 10 scientists received a week of training by their dedicated ActiveEon’s engineer
- A Fortune 1000 company which works in the area of mining machines and wanted to improve their IoT in order to better analyse incoming information from the captors and automate more actions. ActiveEon’s workflows run hourly as well as are triggered on events, run on Amazon Web Services, and helps our customer control and optimize its machines usage.

	00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,260
so the other again so we will

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,759
concentrate this time on the customer

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,240
case one is about French customer that

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,760
is in are not very far from here and the

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,189
other one is a American case as the

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,599
first one is is in genomics that the

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:35,250
second one is in IOT in a mining magnin

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:40,160
machine and so I will present together

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,469
with Fabian that just arrived and Tobias

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:49,440
Tobias is working with acted alone and

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,969
is originally from Germany so just to

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,510
give you a little bit more detail about

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,870
the technology what make it a very

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,359
usable in industrial environment is the

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,979
fact that we are interfaced and we deal

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,659
with many different external software so

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,729
like an external scheduler or ETF so in

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,390
in the UK for instance we work with

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:20,070
talent on a big project for data

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,860
transformation for visa delivery and at

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,640
the level of orchestration so the

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,729
company motto is accelerate automate and

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,130
scale so these are two use cases that

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,560
will present where automation is very

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,290
important we are helping our customer to

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,479
automate the IT for a sense it means

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,000
that when they do that with magnin

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,759
machine sometimes there is a new mining

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,270
machine to add into the processing of

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,750
data and this is automated or to remove

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,600
a machine from the mining machine and

00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:01,590
what we might not see is that the

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,530
automation goes all the way to a fault

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,680
management even if we are in the cloud

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,860
with virtual machine with

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,860
a nice things like doctor and cabinet

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,830
and sing like that those machine fails

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,330
sometime or you have IT processes that

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:25,340
fail and part of the automation is to

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:28,700
manage failure and to manage recovery in

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,850
some fully automated or semi-automated

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,190
the manner and this is of course very

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,250
important because even if we are in

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,100
develops you still have a lot of people

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,489
that develop software and hands on the

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:48,160
software to people that are in operation

00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:54,470
with not very high IT skills thank you

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,600
okay so so we'll cover that before and

00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,790
the two use cases that will present you

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:05,450
this is a joy global here and in her in

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,209
a in biotech okay so i will let the

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:17,090
fabulet actually work worked with the

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:20,030
customer click on the in rockets so the

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:25,360
use case we implement at in harvest as

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:29,870
you clear collaborative development

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,810
environments development and simulation

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,980
environment based on the air language so

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,440
we deployed the party scheduler on the

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:48,680
in hind ha structure which is a cluster

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:52,220
of about 25 machines and the inner inner

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,269
scientists are able to submit directly

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,130
some air computations so r is a is a

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,799
reference language for statistical

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,410
computations so they they are able to

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,650
submit directly from the our environment

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,680
interface to the party scheduler and

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,519
this will transparently be executed on

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,070
the cluster so which means that small

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,609
instance of air computation will be run

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,050
on individual machines

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:26,409
and our our connector toolbox will

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,080
aggregate those massively parallel

00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:35,590
computation our computation in a in a

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:43,000
single view that's about it follow all

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:44,680
these days particularly so the another

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,680
sorry another part of the use case so

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,930
that was a collaborative our environment

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:58,300
project and the second use case was

00:04:49,930 --> 00:05:01,449
actually analysis of sequencing data so

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:06,639
that means that so basically every week

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:10,509
the sequencer is computing at the NC DNA

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:14,439
sequences on on genomic engine on and on

00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:18,159
they are use kind of products or cells

00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:22,090
and produce all the sequencing data as a

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:24,520
as a large set of files and the

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,219
scheduler is then used to dynamically

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,199
grab all the files produced by the

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:38,759
sequencer and then running on the on the

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:44,789
in hug cluster a set of typical DNA

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:50,110
processing which is a line DNA alignment

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:53,860
and well I don't know another DNA

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,099
scientists metagenomic senses and so we

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,860
use basically our schedule this this

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:03,240
example is real production deployment

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,919
and the other project is a collaborative

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,969
collaborative environment so we have to

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,729
schedule from two different uses so in

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,770
terms of architecture what we call here

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:19,930
the party para scientific tool box this

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:22,599
is our environment this connects to the

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,639
party scheduled the party flick

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,950
scheduler will then execute our

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,090
computation on

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:34,840
on the Linux cluster here regarding the

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:39,420
DNA sequencing production environment

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,210
this comes from the sequencing here and

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,370
dynamically when new sequencing arrives

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:48,420
we integrate this information into the

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,710
party scheduler which will execute

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:58,470
possible assessing on the on this

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:58,470
windows crystal any question regarding

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:10,570
you know um I like to introduce you to

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:13,150
our use case of IOT and we did this with

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,730
joy global and I had the pleasure to

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,360
work with joy global lets you see a

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,700
jogger they manufacture and service this

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,220
huge machine for my name's all over the

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,570
world I was super excited working with

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,010
them they explained you all those things

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,810
how it works and how it goes on the

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:34,120
lines and yes as you can see they have

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,190
they operate mines underneath to earth

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,350
so there's machines underneath doors

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,680
completely isolated from the internet

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:47,800
from anything and then they have mining

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:51,160
machines yeah in the outside and so they

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:59,980
maintain all those all those machines

00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:04,000
and joy global it is a global company

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:07,150
and it's a fortune 1000 company and they

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
have a revenue of a 4.4 billion a year

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:15,010
and we the first thing we did we

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,310
identify their needs we had a very

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,250
iterative process working very well very

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,190
close with a team and there we found

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,920
that there yeah we just discovered their

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,320
needs and they needed a unique analytics

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,349
for each types of machines like you saw

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,940
those pictures there and you can guess

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,460
that each machine needs different

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,560
analytics so and they have many many

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,979
types of machines many many groups of

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,130
machines

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:47,839
and they wanted to to see groups like

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,269
this machine has a tire so you need to

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,630
check the tire pressure for example so

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:56,839
this is a group and they're different

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,760
types different types can be in

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,000
different groups and by score so just

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,490
complex behavior complex dependencies so

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,050
they wanted to trigger analytics on

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:11,600
specific events and we had as we created

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:16,730
this beautiful solution for them we have

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,670
a very flexible in too great a very

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,000
flexible solution for them and we have a

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,800
rest interface on this rest interface

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,930
combined were easily combined able with

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,899
other solutions they had and they we

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,019
could do unique development for them and

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:38,079
they could connect their unique

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:40,820
development with our solution and we

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:45,350
yeah we were able to automate the whole

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,899
processes in the data center and the

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,490
most important things are we have fault

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,839
tolerance for each application what you

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,790
can guess when you don't have internet

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,089
in a machine and something doesn't work

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,130
then you need some fault tolerance and

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,889
we can visualize resources and we have

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,959
fault tolerance for them as well and we

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,779
can yeah we have all fall torrents for

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:11,199
sub systems for sub distributed systems

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:13,610
and here I like to show you the

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,410
architecture we what we have you see the

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,620
data coming from all the machines and

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,440
then the data is processed and with our

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,990
with our software and our software we

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,060
orchestrate Python Java MATLAB different

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,610
types of analytics different types of

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,060
codes and it's dependent on each machine

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:36,050
each group so it's um it's a huge

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,180
complex huge complex software but with

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,610
our interfaces with our workflows we can

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,680
cut this into small pieces that people

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,410
can comprehend it and people without

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,189
computer knowledge can understand it and

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:51,500
modify it actually and then what comes

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:53,930
out is real time controlling

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,100
optimizations so you can see how you

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,779
machines perform and how what's going on

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,510
what's going good with your machines and

00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,110
we you can also see this as a non IT guy

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,630
so people working on the machines have

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:17,589
access to this data as well and we can

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:17,589
scale this so we run this on Amazon so

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:28,370
yeah so just to briefly conclude a first

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,350
for the case of the mining machines is a

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,350
durable there's something interesting

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,500
the this company this b'ham that our

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,080
company used to sell the machine now

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,529
they do not sell the machine they sell

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,980
hours of operation of the machine the

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:49,130
same way that the smegma motors used to

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,910
sell engine for plane now they sell

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:55,550
hours of engine and so those company are

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,120
getting in the strongest need to

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,910
optimize all the IT in regard to the

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,260
operation of those industrial processes

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:10,790
okay and so in both cases we accelerated

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:13,940
treatment with terabytes of big data its

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:17,529
interface with analytics so they use are

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,660
in the case of genomics they use matlab

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:26,230
in several of our customer cases you can

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:32,029
use python python new Titan of

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,990
proprietary software like SS and in many

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,300
cases it's a case for the mining machine

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,329
they use both on crimes infrastructure

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,040
and in the cloud and we must say that

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:49,430
most of our clients are on AWS today

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,370
okay and finally is fully open source

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,550
and the benefits for some very much for

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,550
your attention

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,430
