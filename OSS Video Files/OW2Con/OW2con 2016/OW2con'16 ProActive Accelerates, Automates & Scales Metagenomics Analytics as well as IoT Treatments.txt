Description: 
	ActiveEon is an Open Source ISV offering automation and scalability solutions for IT, Big Data and Internet of Things to accelerate, automate and scale their business processes and reduce their infrastructure cost.
ActiveEon recently worked with two customers in very different areas:
- INRA, the French National Institute for agronomics, in order to integrate a portal dedicated to metagenomics analysis. ActiveEon’s ProActive accelerates the treatments of more than 500 terabytes of metagenomics data per year in R language, and 10 scientists received a week of training by their dedicated ActiveEon’s engineer
- A Fortune 1000 company which works in the area of mining machines and wanted to improve their IoT in order to better analyse incoming information from the captors and automate more actions. ActiveEon’s workflows run hourly as well as are triggered on events, run on Amazon Web Services, and helps our customer control and optimize its machines usage.
