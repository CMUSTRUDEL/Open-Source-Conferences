Title: OW2con'16 Manage File Transfert (MFT) with WAARP R66
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	At Waarp, we have one goal: provide companies with a complete and scalable solution to secure their file transfers at a reasonable cost.
Our philosophy is simple: instead of buying costly licenses, prohibitive for many, we provide professional services around Waarp Platform.
That is why the majority of the platform is Free Software released under the GNU GPLv3 license.
With a team of experts, the R66 protocol has been designed to address the needs, constraints, and requirements of most public and private organizations.

I'm Bruno kalna CEO CTO and co-founder

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:18,240
ha so we are one of the latest numbers

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,789
of w-2 I think maybe that I chest we

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,279
actually received a notification two or

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,740
three days ago that we were accepted in

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,529
a w-2 cut base so I've been invited to

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,450
talk to you that who we are what we do

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:40,379
to to introduce us to you so first thing

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,559
first who are we so we are software

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,280
deter specialized in our MFG women

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,850
itself i transfer emphasis here on

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,730
software deter I talk about I'm

00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:00,449
escalator we primarily a software deter

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,229
we are doing integration but it's just a

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:08,010
min to an end for now we really want to

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:16,770
focus on editing the best software

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:20,369
possible for all of our users so a

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:25,740
little bit of history now our software

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:28,619
was first created in 2007 we were at the

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,390
time at the Ministry of Treasury in

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:37,200
France they had a quite a big project of

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,380
digital archiving I wanted to transform

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,680
a lot of files at a very high frequency

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,259
and they couldn't find any software on

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,979
the market but could fulfill this

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:54,030
requirement all were showing signs of

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,969
weakness and we couldn't agree on one so

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,860
the Ministry of Treasury decided to

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:06,780
sponsor an internal development and to

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:10,580
release it as a ubuntu software first I

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,580
worked on a protocol

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:18,520
we named it as a census for roots

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:24,450
licenses that was designed specifically

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:30,220
to answer every need a company can have

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:33,460
for fat transfer and to monitor them to

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,740
be sure they are safe they arrive at the

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:42,670
destination and in what all is good I

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:47,110
talked about that a little later so that

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,630
was two thousand seven then this off 12

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,940
fell a little in Oblivion we were all

00:02:49,630 --> 00:03:00,310
busy in other companies we couldn't

00:02:51,940 --> 00:03:03,070
leave them given that in 2011 I was off

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,010
12 is effaced the sodomy national

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,120
decided to use it also coincidentally in

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,900
a digital archiving project but they had

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,780
another way of seeing things they wanted

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,890
us to build a company to provide

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,030
professional services support

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:25,390
maintenance and to make sure that the

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,350
software is maintained and the creation

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:33,550
on the other company we were born but we

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:38,080
were still all working in different

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:44,320
companies in 2014 we received a lot of

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:48,100
of demand from front prospect of more

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,330
and more email telephone companies were

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,820
interested we decided there too to work

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,880
full-time on this project we really

00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,860
started to develop it to organize it to

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,620
organize the documentation our website

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:09,130
to do a little more communication things

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:13,780
touch it off gently under here we are in

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:18,750
now we just join our w-2 we are small

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:25,500
team yet 656 people butter

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:30,810
we are looking looking to recruit a lot

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:34,920
of blood if you know developers to

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:40,710
terrain for searching because the last

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:43,850
thing about us we are a foremost nap and

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,630
tech company eighty percent of our

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:52,140
revenue is pensioner ng we don't want to

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,790
become a purely commercial company we

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,650
don't want an arming yourself below

00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:02,700
salesperson what other workers tomorrow

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:07,110
and users or AG harassed by a circle

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,169
zone from Oaxaca p.m. we don't want that

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,800
we want another kind of relationship

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,960
with a well user and our customers open

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,560
source is great we have a direct

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:24,180
connection with all of users we are

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,390
about through our backtracking through

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,419
the code repositories we made we want

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:36,060
the same personalization ship with our

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:40,950
customers stir the Dodgers now what do

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:44,130
we do we do monitored five transfer I'd

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:48,380
say we are a teaching the only open

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:52,169
source MFG platform as far as I know

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:57,180
there is no complete full

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:59,640
enterprise-ready other solution on the

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,930
market open source solution on the back

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:07,290
end so what is am ft OMFG is before all

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,870
factions her fashions very simple it's

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:14,310
checking a file on server a and putting

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,370
it on sir bobby the enterprise don't see

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:23,300
that way they have a lot more

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:29,240
requirements here they see document

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:32,940
jajajaja invoices payment order

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,580
or production plan for factories really

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,850
critical document generated by an

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,450
application and that must be processed

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,090
by another application another asada

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:49,260
maybe on another data center in another

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:52,770
country and aya aya standard water this

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:57,000
turns out they won't guarantee of

00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:03,390
delivery when the file is sent it must

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,830
arrive if there is an error it must be

00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:09,150
restarted automatically or manually and

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,230
preferably not from the start of the

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:18,840
file when they sound so file that way

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:23,520
the chains of jaga bite it's a waste of

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,220
bandwidth they want a guarantee of

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,870
traceability they want to know where

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:36,900
everything is they contrast a purchase

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:39,510
order they contrast the payment they

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,810
want the answer at any time to the

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:49,710
question where is my file is it arrived

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:52,680
is it not why they want a grantee of

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,860
integrity when a file is sound it must

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,970
arrive but you must arrive complete and

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:04,080
this might not be corrected we have a

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:06,330
lot of checks for that they want the

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,200
transfer solution to be integrable in

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:15,630
that system it's about two applications

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:20,070
communicating an application produce a

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:23,880
Phi yes data but so that file must be

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:28,980
processed it sounds it's met then again

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:37,509
be trans processed or basic processing

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:41,300
are a BCG Caskey transcoding we do

00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:46,959
and it must be done via via Resta using

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:51,050
recipe API using the API using your pc

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,430
etc they have very i required amount of

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,709
security Theismann must be encrypted

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:03,379
connections men must be encrypted every

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:06,649
transfer must be authorized that's

00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,910
that's one of the main points we have to

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:15,550
discuss with our customers and there is

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:21,170
a requirement of performance sun sand

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:24,319
several file every second a solution an

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,800
mft solution must handle a very high

00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:30,889
number of phi a very high number of

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,990
heavy fines sounds at a very high

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:38,379
frequency so how do we respond to that

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,990
need we are first developed on a

00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:45,740
protocol as a census which has this

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:51,970
desire to be efficient to be secured and

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:58,689
is five transfer oriented virol the ftp

00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:04,040
at some point HTTP SFTP all need only

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:07,389
miss one major thing they are not easily

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:12,470
integrable into enterprise processed

00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:16,040
here we include free transfer on post

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:20,779
runs for processing chain of the file in

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,870
the transfer transaction if one of the

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:28,309
processing failed but the whole transfer

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,300
is mapped in a row then it can be

00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:34,699
restarted for the processing and there

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:38,990
can be started again and all will find

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:43,999
you eventually to operate the transfer

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:47,209
we have one person sees a monitor that

00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,740
sounds unreal suffice it can be your

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:53,959
account or

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:59,510
and provide all the guarantees i just

00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:03,830
mentioned okay I stood up okay we have

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:09,860
an ftp gateway to integrate with other

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:12,560
protocols and especially under transfers

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,040
with external partner third party

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,680
companies and while I test application

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,339
what manager is a central administration

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,980
and wintering your interface to

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,870
orchestrate and analyst rate or the

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,160
transfer infrastructure of a companion

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:35,990
here we talking about a generic hundreds

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,250
of all variants what passes insist you

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:42,890
know in an organism in an organization

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,580
but that's not enough the market is

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:51,110
dominated by our proprietary solutions

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:55,329
always the same so we need to go to true

00:11:51,110 --> 00:12:00,770
to cover a larger perimeter to really

00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:04,940
answer one need manage all the transfer

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,899
other components and maybe go in the

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:12,850
future toward the data transfer since so

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:16,250
everybody is going to pure data

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,390
communication with that API and cue yes

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:24,010
v etc and that's it and I'm sorry I know

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,010
