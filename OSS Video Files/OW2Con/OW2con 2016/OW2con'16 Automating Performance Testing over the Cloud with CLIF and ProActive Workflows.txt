Title: OW2con'16 Automating Performance Testing over the Cloud with CLIF and ProActive Workflows
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	During the two last years, the CLIF project focused on demonstrating fully automated performance testing including deploying and configuring both the distributed CLIF load injection system and the distributed application under test over an IaaS cloud. Integrated to an automation server like Jenkins, these demonstrations provided a valuable support for achieving performance testing in continuous integration. However, the underlying technical solutions for orchestrating nodes instantiation and configuration were very adherent to specific technologies, like Java wrappers, shell scripts or yaml definitions, which drastically reduces the community of potential adopters.
With the fresh work reported here, we believe that devOps teams must be given the choice of their favorite scripting or programming language for performing the nodes configuration, while benefiting from high level graphical tooling to specify the deployment process of their distributed architectures.
While OW2 projects ProActive and CLIF collaborate since years at the middleware level (distributed communication, test scheduling and execution resources management), the CLIF project was very excited to experiment the brand new ProActive Workflows module to respond to these new deployment orchestration challenges.
