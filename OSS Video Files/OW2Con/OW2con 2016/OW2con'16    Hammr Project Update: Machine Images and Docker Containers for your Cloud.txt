Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Hammr is an OW2 open source, command-line tool for creating consistent and repeatable machine images for different cloud or virtual environments, or migrating live systems from one environment to another. Designed for cloud era environments, where agility and automation are key, hammr helps organizations automate the creation of machine images for hybrid environments. This presentation will focus on the hybrid capabilities of hammr for any virtual or cloud target environment. It will also include a focus on DevOps and Docker integration, and show how hammr can be used to quickly build and run Docker images, helping accelerate development and test processes among other benefits. Finally, we will present the latest hammr features, including the ability for cloud providers to customize target platforms and expose their own IaaS infrastructure as top-level branded objects accessible via hammr, thus easing the path from user images to their cloud infrastructure.
