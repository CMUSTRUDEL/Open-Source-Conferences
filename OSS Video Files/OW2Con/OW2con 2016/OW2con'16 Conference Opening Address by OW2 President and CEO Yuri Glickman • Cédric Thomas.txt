00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,000
possibility to to meet each other at

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,129
least once a year exchange ideas and and

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,120
check what is the status of our

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,600
community where we go what our key ideas

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,490
ideas establish new collaborations and

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,159

the program its we have many interesting

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,450
presentations we see here and I think we

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,670
need to keep time for our most important

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,670
part of conference thank you

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,730

i'm randall to be to a couple of

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,050
housekeeping announcements before we

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:58,720
really get into the core this conference

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,360
since you see the way we organized here

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,160
if you need to move please use a door

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,179
over there and and this evening there is

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,920
a a big sports bar the other side of the

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:19,390
the avenue and if you want to join us

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:23,320
your share be up maybe welcome so i have

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,000
a presentation here for you to set the

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,430
stage for this the theme of the

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,890
conference and to update you on what W

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:37,540
is doing with regard to go to products

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,880
so we try to position or durability in

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,320
the value chain of a virtual software

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:49,620
and right from the onset we've analyzed

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,450
that open source was not only a way to

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,530
collaboratively develop software but

00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:00,430
also a way to develop business open

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,769
source being a business strategy I mean

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,470
to share with you a couple of reminders

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:09,640
slice you've probably seen about our

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,709
context I first of all have to pay my

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:18,519
respects to the four freedoms that

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:22,720
govern that our activity and that we're

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,630
defined over 30 years ago so the first

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,079
one is the right to use the software for

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,780
any purpose the second freedom is the

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:36,340
one to read the code to be able to read

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:40,180
the code the third one if it comes it's

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,370
the freedom to redistribute the software

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,280
same way you would do with a good book

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,740
and share it

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:53,760
the fourth freedom is the one to modify

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:57,000
the software and who redistribute this

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,140
modified copies of the software that

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,300
these rules for simple rules have at the

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,860
power to change the software industry

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,440
but open source free software and open

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,060
field is not just these four rules it's

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,300
been a whole evolution I said three

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:20,250
years ago does where define 30 years ago

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,140
and open source software free software

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,130
open source software is not a monolithic

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:32,760
thing we identified three big models or

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:36,870
three key categories of flaws makers you

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,910
have the developers the geeks open

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,790
source of free software started with

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:47,520
them started with a mythical and values

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:50,970
to share software and to regain

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:57,260
possession of their own creation and to

00:04:50,970 --> 00:05:01,830
control the result of their creativity

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:05,479
the second category or the second

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,810
category of makers are the entrepreneurs

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,310
because towards the middle of the 90s

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,220
something happened and free software

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:18,870
became open source software became

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:22,169
commercial open source software and open

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:25,590
source became really an industry or

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,650
market industry strategy and then around

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:33,979
2010 with cut computing with the

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:37,860
explosion of big multi-vendor

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:41,850
technologies and platforms we had the

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:45,180
third category of flaws makers and these

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,570
are the committee's big collaborative

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:55,200
projects including OpenStack including

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:56,090
genivi including opendaylight big

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,410
companies

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:04,710
realize that open source could be the

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,200
vehicle the mechanism through which they

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,120
could collaborate through which they

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,590
could jointly develop new technologies

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,730
without making a mistake without

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,000
investing in a technology that nobody

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,950
will follow and so they want to be in

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,840
the back and the only way to make sure

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,600
that you make the right decision that

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,450
you don't reinvent the mini tail it's to

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,340
actually work together with the other

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,650
people and collectively define what

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,410
should be the roadmap the trajectory of

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:42,270
the technology you're working on open

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,890
source the open source context is also

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,810
defined by third-party organizations we

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,240
have development teams the company's

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,070
this big project but there is also

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,050
another category of stakeholders of

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,320
frauds makers and these are the

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,730
third-party organizations I start with

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,700
the bottom you have those that define

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,940
the standards the standards are they are

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,940
common vocabulary then you have those

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,730
organizations that support open source

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,160
that advocate that defend open source

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:18,780
that promote open source such as a

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,780
prolee in France and then going up you

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:28,670
have some organizations or companies of

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:32,130
a nonprofit that provides the legal

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:36,530
context for open source software open

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:40,320
source being a collaborative endeavor

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,280
open source is based not on a power play

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,780
but it's more based on respecting

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,120
collaboration rules so the roots of the

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,720
games are given by the open-source

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,130
licenses and these licenses are fostered

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,200
by a third-party organizations species

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,990
especially OSI and Free Software

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,660
Foundation and then we move on to the

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,040
technologies this layer of technologies

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,430
the first one

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,710
concerns those interest groups they are

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,470
loosely coupled groups of people not so

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:17,910
organized and they've given us some of

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,260
the best technologies then you have

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,870
those that are called product line

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,930
organizations they are very efficient

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,360
they're very market driven and they've

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,390
provided us with some of the the key

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,630
products that we are actually using

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,950
today throughout the market but why if

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,200
you realize these all these

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,530
organizations at this level they all

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,850
driven by a private company a commercial

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,970
company openoffice was driven is driven

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:51,690
by Oracle or going to buy canonical

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:55,110
Mozilla has a profit-making company

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,510
within it exempt by Citrix federer by

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:03,270
red hat etc you can think of your own

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:05,280
examples these are the good for the

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,620
communities but also good for their

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,040
companies they're not independent the

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,680
top layer are is the layer of the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,160
independent organizations and we claim

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,050
to be among those we claim to be an

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,460
independent organization governed by a

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,750
multi-party board of directors such and

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,370
that's the same for the Linux Foundation

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,210
the Eclipse Foundation the Apache

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,010
foundation the open side ponytail these

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:36,630
are the organizations with which we

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,670
compare ourselves let us our context now

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,950
to set the stage for the theme of this

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:48,410
conference we should get started with

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:52,170
the code software is code code

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:56,100
characters somewhere that's essentially

00:09:52,170 --> 00:10:00,050
where this code you can download codes

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,150
you can read improve and share of course

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:07,950
but nevertheless got that for somebody

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:10,470
like me doesn't mean much especially if

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:15,960
I look at this the graph of the top top

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:18,140
left and for somebody like me or for any

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:23,430
kind of decision maker

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,990
we need a little bit more than that if

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,720
you want if you intend to do business

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,640
with code with self a piece of software

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,810
then you got to change your mindset and

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,530
you got to think of it as a product code

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:47,010
as the basis for business is a product

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:48,930
and a product is what you sell but it's

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,540
not just the code it has a lot of things

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:56,160
a software product is code plus

00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:01,290
documentation packaging world map

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:06,090
training upgrades that's what a decision

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:11,630
maker wants to buy including support

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:16,350
training etc and that's what actually

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,720
please value to the code of course you

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,850
have the whole value chain where

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,160
research and development developed the

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,120
cold proof of concepts you can abuse

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,060
cases demonstrators but then what really

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,090
gives value to your code is something

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,950
people we call product marketing

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:39,560
something that is provided by it by

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:45,810
suits and that if code is the

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,820
fundamental piece of the product the

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,460
rest is what really makes defines the

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,070
value and you realize that i've added

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,710
thing for open suse governance because

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,680
he now context what people want from

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,080
market is predictability quality and I

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,700
want to trust it and Trust is what

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:10,380
actually makes the product a project

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:17,130
grow it's what attract third party

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:20,340
contributors today you need to recognize

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:23,640
that we're more comfortable most of us

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:29,250
at developing the code and leaving the

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,570
rest to other people people will look

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,940
down on because

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,390
they note has good and creative as those

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,920
that create the code and that's what we

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,420
call the delivery challenge we've had

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,990
that in mind that to the b2 for some

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,990
time and since all the ability to is

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,600
want to be part of this value chain we

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,230
know we can trust you to develop the

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,910
code and we've given us our mission to

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:04,430
grow a code base but also to help you

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:07,860
address this delivery challenge and

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,070
looking at the value chain and things

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,130
that we've been doing for the last 10

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,590
years now there are a couple of lessons

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:22,200
for lessons that I'd like to share with

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:24,600
you the first one obviously is that code

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,820
is only a fraction of the software value

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:34,410
chain that decision-makers expect full

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,570
market-ready offerings they don't want

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,550
code that they can temper work they can

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,190
they can temper with but it's the one

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,510
code that it's not something to play

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,570
with if something has to be professional

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:53,540
the second lesson is that collaborative

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:57,270
development very often stopped short of

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,940
delivering market radio products you can

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,740
even think of OpenStack this is a very

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,510
good example OpenStack is a toolbox

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,620
deliver lots of bits and pieces

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:13,560
technologies but the money can be made

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,950
by service companies that provide

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,950
service integrating all that but it is

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,750
also made in terms of products by those

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,600
commercial companies selling

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:28,100
distributions and you have the Red Hat

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,260
distribution the hpe distribution etc

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,660
you think of Linux you have the Linux

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,940
from the next foundation what you can

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,130
that you can download you would be very

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,080
comfortable downloading but personally

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,960
I'm more comfortable at downloading

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:49,120
ubuntu which is a distribution

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:52,960
a third lesson that is a bit less

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,780
obvious if you have to realize that the

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,650
successful open source projects are all

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,770
supported by major companies and IT

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,560
companies these companies you see there

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:09,520
are not associated so naturally

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,010
associated with open source and yet they

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,670
put millions of dollars in open source

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:18,580
projects they put dozens of people in

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,870
open source projects they understand

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,000
that open source is something that

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,710
brings value to them they're the

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,130
strategic vision of other consoles is

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,460
they want to have a say in where open

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,730
source is going or what is developed

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,320
they want to keep not control but they

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,760
don't want to let open source go like

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,790
that they understand that it's part of

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:44,380
the market part of the industry and even

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:46,510
if you look at the top right logo well

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,090
you have to know that the president of

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,120
the Apache foundation is a full-time

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,500
employee of that company company you

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,890
would not naturally associate with open

00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:02,380
source software so there is you it's the

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,860
magic in some project is that they grow

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:10,000
and explode without being supported by

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:14,380
these companies but that historical

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,300
that's a little bit of magic that's a

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:24,820
bit random it's based on its serendipity

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:28,240
this can work but big companies in the

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,610
IT industry to make money even telcos

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,340
equipment vendors software companies

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,250
systems integrators how do I

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,340
manufacturers they don't want to depend

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,260
on serinda pity they want to control

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:46,930
their future they have to take stock

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:49,480
holders they're reporting so they are

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:52,300
are being more and more proactive and I

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,630
think that's an evolution we should

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,630
consider

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:02,490
and the last lesson is that this

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:06,959
successful collaborative projects they

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,000
implement flourless governance that's

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,100
very easy to understand these big

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,470
companies that agree to work together

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:18,959
share codes share efforts and together

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,020
this some visual they don't want all

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,250
this to be captured to be under the

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:28,460
control of one of these partners they

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,440
want to play on the ground that is

00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:35,850
really neutral with a guarantee of

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,820
neutrality and that's why you have these

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,100
foundations that's exactly why OpenStack

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,280
that started under the umbrella of

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,640
rackspace move to become in a person's

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,380
foundation that's exactly why some

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,150
project are being developed within the

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,490
linux foundation within the Eclipse

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,630
Foundation and why we are developing

00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:01,110
project and developing initiatives under

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:04,380
the o.g umbrella fertility because those

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:09,870
organizations can actually provide a

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:14,810
recognized neutral governance that's the

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:18,870
role one of the roles that we play now

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:21,660
an update on door duty to an update or

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:24,540
w-2 this slide you've seen it probably

00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:28,170
at least ten times because it's a slide

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:30,360
we designed in 2006 when we were

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,580
preparing the launch of a w2 and it

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,180
still it still works so we're still

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,610
executing this long-term plan and that's

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,730
what W in one picture in a world zoom in

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,380
each of this part but basically our

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,590
mission is to develop a code base of

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:51,570
infrastructure software so the code base

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:54,570
is our resident data this code base is

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,990
the road by a community that community

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,990
works in the framework of activities

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,150
these activities are governed by rules

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:06,750
from this open-source governance and we

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,460
can all work we're all very comfortable

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,960
and independent

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,290
because we have our members that pay our

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:19,170
fees and I ganti own independence we can

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:26,180
be neutral the code base we ran some 100

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:31,320
project they governs long a life cycle

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:35,970
so we have 35 project in incubation some

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,580
25 in the material state those are elite

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:42,390
project if you like and we are 40

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,820
project that are in in archival those

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,240
project to the right of the screen

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:51,810
rotational cloud-based paths its type

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,430
IMX access and Prelude those that have

00:19:51,810 --> 00:20:01,100
had some news for you and four of them

00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:05,030
asustek is new in the vertical base and

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,320
those the other four I've achieved

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,470
virtual status I've been upgraded to

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,370
metro Stefan lawyer well city our CTO

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,640
will learn explained in a session

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:22,130
dedicated through the technology council

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:25,460
the community the committee is global we

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:29,610
there are about 40 organizations renders

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,890
I must confess that only 25 of them pay

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,600
their dues but I've been discussing with

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,720
other organizations and they're all in

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,530
the same situation Juarez if that can be

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,710
reassuring we have over two thousand two

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,140
hundred members six associate

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,380
organizations including Eclipse

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,670
Foundation d MTF suggestions of early

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,110
brain Brazil for instance and we are

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,570
present across 20 events on three

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:01,170
continents the graph you see at the

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,350
bottom shows the inner circle is the

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:08,460
total breakdown of those 2,000 members

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,650
and the outside circle shows the

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,690
evolution with the last 12 months

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,270
showing that the blue part is about

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,930
Europe and our growth in Europe is

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:22,430
stronger than any in any other part of

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,430
the world even in in France

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,340
in the activities are mentioned a

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,500
project I'm not going to repeat by the

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,370
project but I want to mention the

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,410
initiatives so we are five initiatives

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,150
running and one that is in preparation

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,560
so the initiative again it's a joint

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,520
it's beyond the project is they don't

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:45,270
effort bioW to members to put together

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,930
projects developed platforms or stacks

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:52,140
and address the market market need so

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:53,490
initiative is market-focused we have the

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,140
big data initiative the open-source club

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,730
initiative privacy and security

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,620
initiatives for which we will have a

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,210
session future internet software and

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,830
services initiative we have the

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,080
open-source accessibility initiative

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,430
that has been launched recently and for

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,770
which we have a dedicated session

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,290
tomorrow and we're working on a session

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,780
called open source in big cities

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:17,280
initiative for which we can we can talk

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:20,220
later the governance we have a

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,560
governance that has weathered the ups

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,550
and down of an open-source organization

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:28,110
for 10 years so it runs of course there

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,720
are little holes here and there we still

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,730
learning because situation changed new

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,730
situations appear and we have to adapt

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,670
our governance what you see there it's

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,920
covered by the bylaws plus a set of

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:45,680
binding documents the legal compliance

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:49,020
the IPR policy trade policy etc this is

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,220
enforced by two decision bodies which

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,110
are the board of directors and the

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,620
management of his and then we have all

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,300
the activities part with the project

00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,400
submission process the book of

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,590
procedures to how we run things the

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,320
initiative charter that defines what is

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,330
initiative the mutual project criteria

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,370
that define how project evolves around

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,800
the value chain etc and these are

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,890
governed by the management committees of

00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:19,220
each activities one hand and overseen by

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:22,650
the technology council on the other hand

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:28,260
in terms of finances are our

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:31,680
independence our budget is roughly 600

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:36,510
thousand euros per year

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:38,190
compared to many much more in the other

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,280
organizations with which we compare

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,380
ourselves that have budget into the

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:49,770
starting at three four million dollars

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:52,800
up to 15 20 million dollars so we are an

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,930
outsider I don't wanna say we're a niche

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,120
player but we're an outsider but we do a

00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:02,420
job and we are the only ogus

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,420
organization that is grown out of Europe

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,140
financially we're okay we need to be

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,060
very careful with cash management and we

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,560
need to end the year with lots of cash

00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:16,830
because members take their time in

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,480
paying the dues so so we start the

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:22,380
bidding of the year with not much money

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,100
and we really need to have cash in order

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,600
to be able to get through the first

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,360
three four months so that's the

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,620
situation that's the forecast for 2016

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:39,510
and the bottom graph shows the how we

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:41,040
the breakdown of our resource the four

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,530
for the first three years we were

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,960
relying only on membership payments and

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:50,760
since then we've introduced cooperative

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,650
project will rely on subsidies by

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,750
collaborative project and what you see

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,430
here is that the red part are the kivati

00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,720
projects for the last five years and the

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:02,580
blue is the membership fees but that's

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,850
what we have to do to maintain our

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,420
financial independence so all this makes

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,150
us an ecosystem platform I know the Nico

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,870
system platform what's the platform a

00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:18,990
platform is essentially something that

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:22,350
addresses the needs of different kinds

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,500
of segments market segments on one hand

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,330
we have the code producers this

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,310
community here and on the other hand we

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,750
have the users and we need to address

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,940
the users so we need to be like a

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,500
channel to the users so we need to try

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,410
the users we also need to attract the

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,760
privileges to grow a code base and we

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,600
have to organize the fit would like the

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,690
fit book a feedback loop and we do that

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,580
by providing like all

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,900
platforms three key services

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,380
infrastructure services or technical

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,320
services government services or rules of

00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,230
engagement how we all work together

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,870
press efforts to position the whole

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,360
thing onto the market quick update on

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,770
each of these key services in these four

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,250
structure we are evolving our

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:15,250
infrastructure we there is a migration

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:18,170
in progress towards more up-to-date

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,270
technologies and we want to offer a

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:23,210
better service to our members we are

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,070
integrating working on an sso and stefan

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,090
no--yeah will detail this tomorrow at

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:30,950
the Technology Council session we're

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,750
migrating we're using the future

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,450
directory which is one of our project

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,870
which will be presented at this a

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:43,610
session at this conference in terms of

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:47,690
the government layer a quick update here

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:51,500
will be that we are evolving our the way

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:56,450
we manage we follow and we support the

00:26:51,500 --> 00:27:00,200
project I've been talking a lot to hear

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,540
about the squat program software quality

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,410
assurance and trustworthiness which was

00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,380
launched in 2010 with the the ambition

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,450
to actually put together data about each

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,940
project in order to increase the

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,490
transparency and information available

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,100
for the users in order to facilitate the

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,290
decision making by the users so that we

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,620
want them to feel comfortable with a

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:27,200
project by sharing with them data by the

00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,790
project so we're evolving this we took

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,030
part in a cooperative project called

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:34,430
riscos that added a little bit of more

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,710
methodology that started four years ago

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,900
and now we integrating all this we

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,040
upgrading it by taking into

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:46,340
consideration qualities such as ease of

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,470
deployment or and I think we will evolve

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,820
in taking into consideration maybe the

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:56,000
accessibility of the project to be

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,060
consistent with our activities and and

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,850
this is evolving into a

00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,700
Drake that Stefan again is leading which

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:07,170
is called Oscar Oscar standing for open

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,760
source capability assessment radar and

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,680
and we're very pleased to have and this

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,950
is how we met with the debit wheeler and

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:21,840
we will be very pleased to exchange on

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:25,990
this on this topic key update on our

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,540
mark Rome or outreach you know that we

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,610
took take part in many many events in

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,160
the world so that's business as usual

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,400
but maybe something I need to mention

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,870
here and it's that our the marketplace

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,820
have been announcing the last two years

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:46,360
is now ready it's open for business

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:48,040
you're welcome to go to the directory so

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:53,050
you look on it's still called a pub

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:55,510
until the end of the year and we working

00:28:53,050 --> 00:29:01,320
on this with our members front of your

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:03,640
focus and you shall soft so now its

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:08,560
market place where you can go to the

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,960
directory to register your project you

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,610
can create your templates and users can

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,160
actually go to the store discover the

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:19,660
project customize the template and

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,800
actually deploy the software from the

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:26,470
marketplace to their cloud account

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:30,790
that's quite sophisticated and after

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:33,370
January what's important is that in what

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:38,140
I was announcing last year we will open

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:41,200
up the store too I mean the store will

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,310
be the place where code developers will

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,920
be able to showcase commercial services

00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:52,740
so from the store you will be displaying

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:56,110
your project but you can also display or

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,440
advertise or showcase the training

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:04,180
services expertise hosting services into

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,400
systems integration etc even high 19 the

00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,200
partners you can have you have on this

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:16,940
project so that the store can

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:21,380
become one of the nice product promotion

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:26,210
place all this is possible because we

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:31,389
are a professional organization with a

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:35,539
permanent team dedicated so you've met

00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:38,559
Lakshmi of a mango Palin who gave you

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:44,139
your badge and it's just be there

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:47,000
Kathleen well is our Event Manager and

00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:55,010
helped us put everything together here

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,970
and Stefan no year here our CTO only be

00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:01,370
able to you know readies our event

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:07,340
coordinator in a community coordinator

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:10,450
and follows the cooperative project we

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,909
have Mahama our season mean who runs our

00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:17,090
architecture and who's busy working and

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:20,750
evolving the whole infrastructure and we

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:23,389
have a technique where up there only the

00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:28,720
listener who's the the webmaster and

00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:32,240
who's the video capturing all this and

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,000
Google will process this so that all

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,649
this will be published all the

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,850
presentations will be producing website

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:44,720
and in China we not make it today George

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,429
Lewis or coordinator for with China

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,880
because we have a significant Chinese

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:48,880
