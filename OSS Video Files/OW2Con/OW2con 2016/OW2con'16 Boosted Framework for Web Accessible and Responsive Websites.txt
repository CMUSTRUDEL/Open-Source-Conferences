Title: OW2con'16 Boosted Framework for Web Accessible and Responsive Websites
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Training developer to accessibility is not enough; they need ready-to-use tools.

Responsive Design has been the trigger for many web sites refactoring that gave opportunity for accessibility improvement. By the end of 2014 we compared the major market solutions and Bootstrap appeared to be the best. They benefited from a really big support community, a robust and functional framework, open source and of course with a quite good accessibility level. So we decided to use this framework. We studied how to make its accessibility even better and submitted our improvements to the community. That was a good starting point but not enough, we’ve also got some Orange specific components, our brand is not blue and we want to share our work easily with everybody. That’s why we created an open source fork of Bootstrap, called Boosted, providing the best from native Bootstrap and adding up the Orange Brand, some specific components, and an even higher accessibility level.

hello so I'm like yo cell I work in

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,910
orange I will try to to be shortest as

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,050
I'm Christian so i will talk about

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,660
boosted it's a framework based on

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,220
bootstrap we created it for web

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,550
accessible solution and responsive

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:37,050
design I will talk more about it first

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:41,820
for we are a team in a range Oh work

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,719
work forum website for customer and also

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,600
fun praise we try to convince project

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,280
manager that accessibility is good and

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:58,170
it's not an option for that we support

00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,690
project for web and mobile and we used

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,250
em done which is an open source solution

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,590
from mobile demonstrate demonstration we

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,590
also publish some guidelines for

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,439
accessibility specific for range based

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,610
also on excel web solution which is a

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:22,259
good referential and we need to provide

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:25,560
the framework ready to use at the

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,560
beginning we tried to just give some

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,840
components one by one to project when

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,780
they need but it's difficult to

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,250
integrate many solution and they need to

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,240
to apply the brown to those components

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:46,770
so they don't really feel it wise I need

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,240
to take this one and a good point today

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,670
is out automated test for project

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,579
because we can provide accessible

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:01,590
solution but they can degrade the

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,700
quality of the components so it's

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,940
important to test along the project the

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,300
quality of access amici

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,920
and we also work for innovation like

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:20,180
orange come focus and sara sara khan

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,970
focus is a solution to add to browser

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,840
like firefox chrome and internet

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,760
explorer a toolbar with to increase the

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,050
size of the text to change the color

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,350
contrast and also some action for this

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,670
taxi change the font family to append

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,540
dyslexic also increase the space between

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:48,080
the worlds the sentences and also some

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,460
metallic and sarah is totally out of

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,640
orange it's an application form for the

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:59,870
cruise because we've got a colleague

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,660
which is a blind and he enjoy to make

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:07,640
BOTS so we need an application who said

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:10,490
each time where is a buoy sorry cause

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,239
the French and so we developed this

00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:18,470
solution and also a partnership with

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,900
other company in many in France and now

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,470
with asylum with other companions were

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,250
so that's the goal for the state so

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,770
what's busty it's a bigger for the

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:35,590
bigger part it's bootstrap why would

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:40,700
flap because since the last the end of

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:43,390
2014 many of orange project like

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:48,320
Christian said we are going to mabye

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:52,760
need to update as our website and be

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:57,200
more mobile funny and to be clear mobile

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,810
first so bootstrap we we study run those

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,500
market where which was the better

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,739
framework to do that and we also the

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,250
constraint to be accessible so good swap

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:14,989
was investor ins three at the end of 2

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,780
20 40 and it's open source with a really

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,030
big community don't know if you try

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,940
better really big community around

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,940
bootstrap

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,580
and with a quite good activity level at

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,330
the beginning with verse industry and

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,330
today with a version for it's really

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,570
incredible and the major point of

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,030
bootstrap for project which discover as

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,580
a front-end framework because of the

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:47,160
trap it's only CSS javascript and HTML

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,830
many many guys in orange work on Java

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,060
and other languages and they don't mind

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:56,880
about user interface doesn't ask me why

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,380
I don't know and but in good jobs there

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,350
is an extensive documentation which

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,530
explain how to use each component and

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:07,770
what was the key points of each

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,350
component and many times you will have a

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,500
warning for takes care for accessibility

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,990
reason you need to use like that if you

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,060
use in Zeke on this context put this

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:24,300
information so it's really interesting

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:26,970
and but for for when like you know our

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,750
brand is not blue so we've got a problem

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:36,240
with your crap and we also have some

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:38,700
specific components and we're not like

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,550
good shot which provide buttons for

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,350
every website we have a brown guidelines

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,100
brand governance which you say the

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:53,120
pattern it to be 20 pixels spacing and

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,940
everything so we we make an effort and

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:02,660
we adapt the ranch run to food shop at

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,700
the begin and after we put the custom

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,870
components for orange like mega- and

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,780
complex interface components which came

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,140
from project project inside the colors

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,200
unless Oh My Little Nell said me I need

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,510
to make this calendar like that and this

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,790
interface component so we work with them

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:27,510
to improve the accessibility of those

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:32,009
complex component we also increase the

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:36,809
accessibility level on the top three and

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:42,259
so we also push push back our suggestion

00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:45,059
to the community and we we apply to

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:48,240
maintain the documentation of native

00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:52,979
bootstrap for our new components to

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,649
provide we are big documentation to to

00:06:52,979 --> 00:07:00,869
the developers and also we put it open

00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:03,779
source because arrange the really big

00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:09,270
company and its really difficult to

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:11,909
discuss between our part niraj like

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,879
Romania Spain and each country and

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:18,539
everybody so it's strange but when you

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,899
come with an internal orange solution

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,899
everybody looks at her too and said it's

00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:28,169
orange no thank you we'll take this one

00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:32,009
in that coin so we said okay we have

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:34,639
taken the best from bootstrap and we

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:39,360
need now to give it to other people

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:42,860
orange and also outside orange and we

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,039
found a big interest in that open source

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,180
because at the beginning we share our

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,370
accessibility position and our

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,180
accessibility solution in orange and

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,639
outside we are a little team to maintain

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,949
the call that we call the records as

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,300
native components for engendered shrub

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:06,360
and we keep the sync with good job each

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,050
time would stop put out a new release we

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,839
try to pull out one in one or two days

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,719
we create a new version because we know

00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,490
developer one so last ashen even if

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:21,899
project manager said no no we start

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,930
around 311 stay on 311 but 311 was a

00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,180
three years ago yes yes but it works so

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,419
we try to keep think it's really

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,909
important so project take it because

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,680
it's a to date it's a ranch brand and

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:39,750
it's accessible and many times they said

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,079
oh this component is not in bootstrap

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,380
what can I do sometimes I said you can

00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,600
developed it

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,480
step we are not here to develop your

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,000
interface but you can help you to

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,450
studies interface eventually detect as

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,840
soon as possible if there is accessible

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:03,400
key points which need to be work with

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,590
our chill and study most specifically so

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,520
they said okay we work with them we are

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,530
quite reactive and after that for some

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,780
species was a specific component which

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,190
are not very complex intimate access

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:20,680
immaterial supplies they they are the

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:25,030
task force we are two people to maintain

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,610
the cot in the car cod and in front of

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,490
us we've got projects with a 20 or 30 or

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,100
sometime 50 developers so they are the

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,910
test cross so we we explain to them that

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,370
okay you've got some specific need but

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,850
sometimes as this need can be reused by

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,400
other project and before boosted project

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,160
said okay I've got my my solution in my

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,140
corner I've got my mega menu so you can

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,050
found one mega menu for orange france

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,900
one other in also a part of orange

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,330
france one other in spain and etc today

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,850
they come back with the solution and

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,550
said okay we've developed it can you

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,580
take it and include it in boosted said

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,500
yes okay it's a good section so they can

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,250
create a pro request that's very good

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,590
and when they submit a contribution the

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,940
good point is that we can take a look on

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:21,370
the card eventually repairs the

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,550
accessibility problem or arrows and then

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,850
put it back suka so it's really a

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,180
virtual virtuous cycle which is benefit

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,190
for the company for the project and for

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:37,200
the developer today developer are

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:43,000
invested in the tools they use each days

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,480
so the results in fact after one when

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,050
you are elf activity level of project

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,430
inside the group increased when they use

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,570
boosted its really magic psycho sleep

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,690
for our

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,610
my colleagues and I know they are we see

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,470
the project arrived and said okay you

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,230
need to test our check of our excessive

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,230
each other and when we check it's quite

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,770
good you know sometimes there is a man

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,030
they say they make sorry they make a

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,150
complex component into the interface

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:19,360
which is quite buggy or not accessible

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:22,720
but the other points are very really

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,380
really good our efforts spend on too

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,920
complex interface and developer really

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:37,200
and poor well into the sub estate and

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:41,740

future on where we are we are we are

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:45,250
investing in open talks we think it's a

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,010
gesture for accessibility in fact we are

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,530

orange because rid the way kegger it's

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,630
quite long a trip put boosted for

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,110
developer they can take it and use it

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:26,560
and boot shop can be integrated with

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:29,649
quite auditor market orange come for

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,959
proofs for the end user when the website

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,990
is quite accessible the end user if you

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:38,860
need more accessibility you can use this

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,579
solution and for the next step today we

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,709
need to provide more tools to keep and

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:49,300
provides the repair and we need to

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:52,269
provide automatic test because even if

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:55,300
they used boosted today they can break

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:58,029
some accessibility points so today is a

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,790
good point is that they take boost in

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,040
they copy and past the card which is

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:10,019
accessible so it's quite a bit sometime

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,019
they break it so that's our thanks yeah

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,610
