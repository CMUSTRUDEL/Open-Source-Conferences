Description: 
	Training developer to accessibility is not enough; they need ready-to-use tools.

Responsive Design has been the trigger for many web sites refactoring that gave opportunity for accessibility improvement. By the end of 2014 we compared the major market solutions and Bootstrap appeared to be the best. They benefited from a really big support community, a robust and functional framework, open source and of course with a quite good accessibility level. So we decided to use this framework. We studied how to make its accessibility even better and submitted our improvements to the community. That was a good starting point but not enough, we’ve also got some Orange specific components, our brand is not blue and we want to share our work easily with everybody. That’s why we created an open source fork of Bootstrap, called Boosted, providing the best from native Bootstrap and adding up the Orange Brand, some specific components, and an even higher accessibility level.
