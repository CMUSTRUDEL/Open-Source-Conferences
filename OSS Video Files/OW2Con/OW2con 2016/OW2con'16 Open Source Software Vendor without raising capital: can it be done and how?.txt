Publication date: 2016-09-27

Description: 
	Open Source Software can be produced in many ways. One of them is to build a company that will lead and finance the development of the Open Source Software. Most of such companies have raised capital and are using the "Open Core" business model.
This talk aims to present the way XWiki has evolved over the last 12 years, without raising capital and without restraining it's licence, reaching 1,5 MEuros of revenues in the competitive space of collaboration and information management software, contributing year after year to all it's production as Open Source Software. The XWiki Software is now being used around the world by thousands of organizations.

We will go through the ways this was achieved, the way we were helped, the difficulties we had and the way we managed them, the lessons we learned over time and how we believe we can continue to grow in the future while staying an "Open" company.
