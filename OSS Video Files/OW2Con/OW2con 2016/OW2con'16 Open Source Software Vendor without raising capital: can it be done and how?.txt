Title: OW2con'16 Open Source Software Vendor without raising capital: can it be done and how?
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Open Source Software can be produced in many ways. One of them is to build a company that will lead and finance the development of the Open Source Software. Most of such companies have raised capital and are using the "Open Core" business model.
This talk aims to present the way XWiki has evolved over the last 12 years, without raising capital and without restraining it's licence, reaching 1,5 MEuros of revenues in the competitive space of collaboration and information management software, contributing year after year to all it's production as Open Source Software. The XWiki Software is now being used around the world by thousands of organizations.

We will go through the ways this was achieved, the way we were helped, the difficulties we had and the way we managed them, the lessons we learned over time and how we believe we can continue to grow in the future while staying an "Open" company.

	00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:13,349
so first about me annex wiki what we're

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,240
trying to do and and what our story and

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,930
so I will try to focus mostly on our

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,270
story so me I've been running a quickie

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,310
12 years and passionate about open

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,660
source about technical innovation I

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,990
think that the world needs a bit more

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,670
sharing and that when you do something

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,740
it shouldn't be all about just making

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,579
money and that what's interesting is

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,640
also to leave something behind and X we

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,219
key is a collaborative platform we're in

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,040
a quite competitive market I mean we

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,469
have in the collaboration it's going to

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,460
be microsoft and companies like that so

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,379
it's it's not an easy market and we were

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,430
an innovative company when we started

00:00:52,379 --> 00:01:00,719
doing wiki's it was not that much known

00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:03,390
and and and we we had a solution quite

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,570
early and it was directly open source

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,830
well GPL license it's hundred percent

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,320
open source but not necessary

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,659
everything's free and I'll get back to

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,930
that and we were company that does two

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,630
million revenue so our objective is we

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,310
want to create open source we want to

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,860
have a competitive solution on the

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,009
market and we want to be a healthy

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,009
business and we want to be sustainable

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:33,060
in the long term now when you look at

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,329
the issue with investors is that well

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,520
when when there is cash invested the

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,680
investors will want to to get something

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,799
out of the cash and they and the problem

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,710
is that the out is a lot out so they

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,689
want a multiplier and that means that

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,960
investors at some point will want more

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,060
control on the monetization and they

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,130
will push for a maximization of revenue

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,290
at some point because they don't care

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,799
about the goal of the company they care

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,450
about their money and and they will and

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
from my point of view they were they

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,099
pushed for closing more and more and so

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,979
at some point the money versus the

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,810
community becomes an issue and you

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,030
you need a balance between the two and

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,799
and and the investors are in issue in

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,930
this direction and so you have some good

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:21,739
examples my sequel at some point well

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,560
let's sell it to and now it's up taken

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,870
by oracle and at some point strategy

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,810
changes and objective changes and that

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,209
creates forks and many other issues now

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,940
the fully open source issue as say with

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,709
no capital or so that when you're doing

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,690
everything if you're very very open

00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,549
source doing everything focus as well

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,200
the thing is users tend to want

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,099
everything for free and they confuse

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,079
open source in free and and so you're in

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,379
competition with business models that

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:53,329
are that are working in in in a

00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,459
different way so that they have a

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:57,140
freemium model with vc funded and at

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,569
some point there will be an objective to

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,640
cash out the the thing so you can be

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,650
competing with models where initially

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,180
they're losing a lot of money and you

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,340
you cannot lose money because you don't

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,920
have vc funding so it that's an issue

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,780
and so you're competing with with people

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,430
that that are ready to lose money for

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,750
quite some time and that's not so easy

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,419
so you get also the prisoner's dilemma

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,000
for customers when when something can be

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,980
free should they pay for it if i can get

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,840
it for free what should i do so there is

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,900
a complexity there that is not not

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,370
always easy to handle and so if you look

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,019
at the service business model which is

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,500
one of the business models that can be

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,620
applied is that there is a scale issue

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,019
if you want to scale services difficult

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,060
takes more time to scale and it's not

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,440
something simple and the product needs

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,549
to stay competitive so we need to

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:53,239
continue invest in R&D and and so the

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:55,519
service doesn't directly pay for R&D so

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,079
your margin needs to be more important

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,840
than the traditional service business

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,790
model if you want to fund the rd so in

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,349
the end one key issue that the open

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,579
source development needs to be funded I

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,699
mean you you need to pay your employees

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:11,000
you don't get as was said many times

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:14,000
like most people contributing to open

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,590
source are paid some people are doing it

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,419
for free when they use the software but

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,140
if you look at particularly good example

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:23,420
is if if your user of an end user

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,070
software b2c software

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,350
yes maybe you can spend some time to

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,870
improve it but if your user of an

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,640
enterprise software well if you're

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,860
employed by a company yes maybe you can

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,820
contribute some things but that doesn't

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,430
happen that much but so you have less

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,320
inclined people to contribute to to an

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,980
enterprise software and so you need to

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,740
find ways to pay for it so now with this

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,510
as a basis how what what what happened

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,840
and what did you what did we learn from

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,240
our journey so the first thing in the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,850
first two years when we spend next week

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:05,450
he started at 2003-2004 we i coded i was

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,970
alone i coded xwiki I lounge free wiki's

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,460
onyx wiki com i created the company i

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,350
had no revenue no leads and the first

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,410
interest of people looking at this wiki

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,150
was the fact that it was innovative and

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,250
so lesson i learned from that is at

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,990
first well you don't make revenue you

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,500
will find you will need to find ways to

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,270
make revenue second lesson is that what

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,700
you need a product and one that interest

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,170
user innovation is one way to get some

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,130
interest some initial interest from

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:38,900
people on your software now the next two

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:41,210
years hold it against oh and i will get

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,160
back to that we code it all the time so

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,540
you need to continue coding all the time

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,240
so that's something you do all the time

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,830
but then so i won't focus that much so

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,920
we were mostly on the infrastructure

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,900
module and we had some first clients on

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,610
custom work and the work was not

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,280
necessarily strongly related to a

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,280
quickie so was people i need something

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,530
okay maybe we can do it and let's use X

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,030
wiki to do it but we could have used

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,190
anything else maybe they were a better

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,140
solution than using xwiki but it allowed

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,390
us to build modules and infrastructure

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,330
modeler iniquity and at some point we

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,640
ended up doing around 250 k revenue at

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,790
the end of these two years so 20 to 50 k

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,190
revenue mostly on service but mostly

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,470
some stuff that is not that much related

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,900
a bit in the collaborative area but not

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,790
necessarily for you it so service is a

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,570
good way to finance the product that

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:35,330
helped us create modules the next two

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,759
years we

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,560
we actually continued coding user

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,569
interface we did more use interest more

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,550
Mackin and we started to do our first

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,409
research project and I like to thank the

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,569
fund for that because he brought us in

00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:51,110
the world of research project and that

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:52,969
has actually been a really important

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,360
thing for its wiki because it brought up

00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:59,930
a lot of funding over time we did also

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,180
the first support sales we put a bit of

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,969
money because we started to have a cash

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,240
flow issues so when you're growing you

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:11,060
know there is a cash cash flow issue we

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,650
had some some first fails in a sense

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,379
that we try to do some partnerships

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,659
which had also to do some semi vertical

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:21,849
products like X wiki for this X wiki for

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:24,710
that but in the end one lesson was that

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,229
we did to me we did too many things at

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,000
the same time and it was difficult so

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,150
one lesson is not doing too many things

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,340
and so research and research project and

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,279
say yeah in France is a great way to

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,259
finance product work and it has been a

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,849
tremendous forex wiki next two years

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:47,000
actually what was interesting is that we

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:49,940
had the crisis in 2008 and it was quite

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,849
tough so we had the first moment where I

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,710
like was not going so well well the good

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,270
thing in technology company is that when

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,620
things are not going so well in a

00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,900
company people start to lead by

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,430
themselves so that's actually a good

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,310
thing so we didn't have that many

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,430
difficulties so we some people left and

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,650
we got back here to balance and it was

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,969
ok but one would think that what the

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,979
biggest thing that helped us was

00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,710
actually international French clients

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,690
reduced a lot buying things but actually

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,779
the first the contacts we had

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,839
internationally started to do I will do

00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:26,479
something so we had some international

00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,639
projects and we started to have a bigger

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,909
amount of international sales and that

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,010
hasn't stopped since then we also went

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,959
back to the core product so we removed a

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,349
bit doing xwiki for this six-week you've

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,419
lab trying to refocus on on the main on

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,250
the main product we reach about 1

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,890
million revenue

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,020
at that time and so another thing

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,790
international is is a great way to

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,260
finance the product especially for an

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,060
open source company open source

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,700
companies are international by nature

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,350
you're putting yourself on on on the

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,620
software online and it comes from

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,600
neighbor today we see that we have about

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,150
thirty percent visits from China we have

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,100
no idea how to do business there but I

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,650
mean we have people interested in next

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,480
week in China and so you at some point

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,680
you need to think about what you what

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,870
you can do internationally and from next

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,060
two years continue improving sewickley

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,730
actually yeah so we added new WYSIWYG

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,430
rendering rest office integration so the

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,650
product evolved and got more features in

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,380
the next two years we actually started

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,180
working more we added app within minute

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,880
to build applications and an extension

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,440
repository so an app store inside a

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,870
quickie so we have an app store system

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,890
to add extensions we we had a fail with

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,600
our first cloud offering we the reason

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,120
one of the reason of failing is that we

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,160
had a discrepancy with what we did on

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,380
cloud and what we had in our product

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,390
actually are technically there was

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,640
something that wasn't working and we

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,250
need so one lesson is that we need our

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,260
cloud offering to be the same one as so

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,180
open source on the clown that's a big

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,980
lesson in the end because you need a

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,350
transition from people trying open

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,880
source to buying cloud and so you need a

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,350
way today Oh choose cloud open source

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,089
on-premise just choose that's a big

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,890
advantage of open source company they

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:17,440
can let people choose and people like

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,880
choice they will choose something you

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,860
don't know what but they like the idea

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,480
that initially when they discuss with

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,270
you they don't have to make that choice

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,220
now and they they can also change that

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,320
choice over time that's an important

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,820
aspect and we have some customers that

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
we have because they have this

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,510
possibility they started with a simple

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
wiki on the cloud and then they grew it

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,270
and then so and and they know that they

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,750
can take it back in there in their

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,580
system later we did larger projects and

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,020
we started doing support sales so

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:52,000
basically getting a record revenue from

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,980
from clients and that that was a big

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,379
thing we started also european research

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,419
projects

00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,759
which is actually even better than

00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,559
French your research project when it

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,839
comes to funding it's more complicated

00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,910
it requires working with other countries

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,129
but it's actually also nice to work with

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,559
other countries so but I would tell

00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:13,679
people go ahead and try to do research

00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,319
projects and European research project

00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,869
we achieved about 1 dot 5 million

00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,029
revenue there one thing we learn is the

00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:22,619
cloud is competitive and we need to link

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,099
it to the open source product so cloud

00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:29,099
isn't is is complex and not so simple

00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:31,529
and next two years we were we didn't

00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:36,899
know gross and now problems were about

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:38,789
growing so internal so how do we how do

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,970
we handle gross how do we hire and

00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:45,749
things like that we did more service

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,749
sales we took over some clients from the

00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:50,099
next partner we did more measurement so

00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,899
actually that's something I also

00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:54,269
encourage people to do is murder murder

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,429
murder murder especially in marketing so

00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,720
trying to understand what what people

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:01,319
like in your product what they don't

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,859
like we maybe we took a bit too much

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:06,869
time to do that like in more information

00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:10,019
about what is being used and what is not

00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:12,239
being used and in open source people

00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,509
tend also to have this our tracking user

00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:17,220
is it good to track you well yeah if it

00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,809
helps you make the bet the product

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,259
better it's good for the users it's

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:24,720
about the ethics of how you use the data

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,489
the you if you have limits it is about

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
how you use the data you don't give it

00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:30,689
away you don't sell it things like that

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,679
but it's good to get information and and

00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:37,409
get consent of the user to get it we did

00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,419
applications we went responsive we reach

00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,970
2 million revenue so one thing we

00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,699
learned is that the service sales are

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,679
tough to to grow and because it takes

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,809
time when you get a big project you're

00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,839
busy on the project and you don't have

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:55,470
much time to resell new ones so what we

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,769
try to do is in in 2015-16 we we try to

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,779
give a push on the product side and so

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,819
one good thing we happen is that we did

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,499
some roadmap financing actually so we

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:07,079
did that in the past to some people

00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:08,940
buying features in the roadmap so buying

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,950
a feature that we add to the

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,530
but actually it was done at a huge scale

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:18,360
in 2015 it's a very large company that

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,310
decided to deploy globally for more than

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,960
hundred thousand people decided actually

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,940
they need a very important feature and

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,620
they paid us 150 thousand euros to do

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,160
that feature and that was almost the

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,950
whole development cycle of the year so

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,780
basically and at that point what

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,700
happened for this year is that in that

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,820
year between the roadmap financing and

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:42,030
the research project and the CF funding

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,520
basically the the R&D was almost break

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,730
even so didn't cost anything to the

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,970
company what what was actually becoming

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,370
costly how is marketing like the

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,070
difficulty to invest in marketing but rd

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,350
became almost break even so now one

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,840
thing is that you can sell roadmap it

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,250
works but it's not easy to repeat you

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,810
know it's gonna be one shot with one

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,280
kind next year they have no reason to

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,930
buy something they're gonna buy it one

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,090
year but not in the next year so it's

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,250
difficult to repeat roadmap financing

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,400
but definitely something to try to do

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,990
because it is highly beneficial you need

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,890
to try to do that without forgetting

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,380
your priorities in terms of product what

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:26,580
we try to do and we fail is we try to do

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,890
to do a package over X wiki that was the

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,050
company package so a subscription and

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,090
what we found out is that this was not

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,570
good for a company our size this might

00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:38,760
be okay for a very much a company with a

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,800
lot of funding able to do a lot of

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,900
marketing work and explain to people you

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,240
have this or you have this etc but for

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,980
us it was not it was not good it was

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,290
difficult to explain it was confusing

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,570
for people ever well what is your doing

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,430
X wiki you're doing it yes what's the

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,600
difference it wasn't there was not big

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,660
different but it was difficult to

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,760
understand so what we realized that this

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,010
was not a good solution for our case and

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,450
I like one thing I heard this morning is

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,160
that in terms of business model in an

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,380
open source if you try something and it

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,660
doesn't work try something else and

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,820
actually this is very true is that you

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,310
need to try to find out what works for

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,710
you what works for your company and in

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,420
this case we found out that at

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,910
at least for now it's not it's not the

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,890
right approach for us and it created

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,140
some confusion and that actually also

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,000
reduced leads because we at some point

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,280
we removed downloads from the commercial

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,860
website so people were not downloading

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,380
xwiki from the commercial website and

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,440
that reduced our needs now we get it we

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:45,860
got it back and now we're getting big

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,450
leads from from that and so one thing is

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,540
that and this is more of a time one

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,400
thing I regret over the time is I should

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,610
have tried to find ways to invest more

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,020
in marketing so at some moments decide

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,420
okay we need more people on the

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,250
marketing side is that and this is

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,960
actually a bias or so from the funding

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,880
of research you get a lot of funding

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,050
from the technology but you don't get

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,030
funding for marketing and you tend to to

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:16,100
reduce to do not have enough marketing

00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:18,860
and so we we need to get more more known

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,670
and and get wheels there is a lot of

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,890
things to put in place on on the sales

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,590
on them on the marketing there's a like

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,630
campaigns emailing two people to remind

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,870
them what you can do for them one thing

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,520
also I realize that people people don't

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,700
know that you can do services for them

00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,640
and they just forget about you and so

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,520
you need to repeat it constantly and

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,680
constantly reach out to potential

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,390
customers or people that installed a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,820
quickie that you can help them and it

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,470
will be more efficient if they work with

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,170
you then if they do it themselves and

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,000
because that's what it actually is so

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,860
that's one of the good thing of the

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,830
business model is that if you if a

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,690
company reaches out to specialists they

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,070
it will be cheaper in the end and if

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,200
they do them themselves do it themselves

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:10,820
um so lesson is that to to making users

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,380
pay for features and interesting bits

00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,630
hard to repeat and the paying offering

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,020
needs to be in continuity of the open

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,610
source offering so you really need from

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,150
my point of view we need to have a good

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:26,180
good continuity from free open source to

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,250
to paying and eventually proprietary if

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,200
you decide that your code some of your

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,760
code should be proprietary and so that

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,590
it needs to be a continuity that is

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,870
for people to move from one to the other

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:42,450
and we didn't have that with X yes and

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:43,920
we decided to stop in the sales and

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,870
marketing so now what what are you

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,860
trying to do so taking from this lesson

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,810
of the of the of the package of the

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,580
company package we are looking at paying

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,710
modules and we're looking at verticals

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,020
so actually so there's two things we're

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,750
going to look at is specific paying

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,030
modules technical ones saying okay still

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,620
open source so if people if specialist

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,700
want them as open source they can get

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:11,700
them but they won't get it free free

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,680
like that so from from from the point of

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,810
view of the company it's going to be

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,350
provided as something that you can pay

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:23,280
for so cloud also will be part of that

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:25,230
but the most important part is that in

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,690
in our case in the type of product that

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,880
we do or we realize that what we need is

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,220
to try to be more focused to the usage

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,490
of the people so we realize we have a

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,530
nice generate platform but that people

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,080
have a hard time projecting the use case

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:43,290
inside that platform and so we need to

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,090
go deeper talking to a specific business

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,060
so getting back a bit to what we had

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,070
done a long time ago try xwiki for this

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,320
six-week II for that but less technical

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,270
actually because even even what we did

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,640
in the past was too technical so we're

00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,270
most thinking about X wiki for sales X

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,160
wiki for four HR or a quickie for IT and

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,870
these packages which are merely a

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,060
reorganization of what already exists so

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:12,120
it's not actual huge code it's more a

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,730
configuration of your ex vici instance

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,400
these packages will be paying packages

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:21,480
that's what we plan to do and having

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,010
also a model around extensions so in the

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,630
app store where you can have free stuff

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:31,020
and paste em in our cloud providing this

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:36,120
directly providing these verticals

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,670
directly we think that to go further the

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,310
product way we need to go in the users

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,200
orientation basically because and one of

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,500
the reasons of this is the competition

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,690
with cloud

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:54,370
the SAS SAS services are there is a huge

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:58,480
amount of vertical cloud offerings on

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,830
the market and in and so as a generic

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,500
platform if you don't have something

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,200
kind of ready to go more and more you

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,290
get competition from verticals from from

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,120
from SAS services for specific business

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,910
so we need to have something more ready

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,240
for a specific use case for specific

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:20,890
business so these slides I had them for

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,690
two uh as a reminder so more when when

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,970
people get the presentation online it's

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,580
it's a bit all the lessons that we had

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:31,470
over time now there is one item to

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:35,860
finish is now what can the community do

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,720
around open source product and so one

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,150
thing that the community needs to do is

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,610
make a difference between come with

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:46,900
between between propriety cloud or open

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:50,050
source cloud I mean right now users

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,260
don't don't understand how how locked in

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:56,110
there will be two propriety clouds and

00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,180
they don't yet understand that and they

00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,860
only see the price they only see the

00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,020
price they don't see the future price

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,640
they don't see the fact that they are

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,700
locking in a model in a rating system

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,130
with them and the fact so that and and

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,160
they don't see also the premium models

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,440
the fake premium models like the premium

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,580
models fended by VC that will change

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,950
later so they it's really hard for for

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,800
customers to to understand that they

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,960
might be going into something that might

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,480
disappear or might significantly change

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,010
in terms of pricing and this is

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
something they wouldn't get with open

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,770
source but they they don't see it they

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,180
will think the same that you're the same

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,180
everybody is the same and it might

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,920
happen and so I as a as a customer we

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,170
had the case of a cloud service that

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,790
stopped and was taken over by a company

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,370
and they told us well you have one month

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:51,040
to switch to our new offering fifty

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,780
percent more expensive and plus you need

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,220
to spend a lot of time to reconfigure

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,730
everything you've done in the past

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,880
but it disappeared and so you have high

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,419
risks of high risk of the service

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,030
disappearing or just to offer change up

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:10,510
no free offer anymore you have to pay or

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,520
go away and that that people that is an

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:16,570
issue with with the models that we have

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,039
today and and when users by service on

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,530
open source software they need to look

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:26,590
also at would as the R&D so a second

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:31,179
difficulty that that that people have

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:33,669
that companies like us have is that you

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,230
get in competition with service company

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,320
using open source software not

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,230
contributing to them and not not having

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,330
any rd in there in there in their

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,640
business and that customers need to know

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,679
it they need to have the information so

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,900
you there is a lot of education to do on

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,539
the market to explain that there is a

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,000
difference between between an offering

00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:57,179
that contributes to R&D and another

00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,159
thing that doesn't contribute to our d

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:05,200
you don't don't agree citric sinking so

00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,270
to give an example in our business from

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,130
time to time we come on public websites

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,080
so we're doing public website and so

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,110
what is the public website business its

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,750
web agency is working with interns and

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,419
making websites very quickly ways open

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,860
source software and and that's great for

00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,230
open source open source will be

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,289
everywhere it will be deployed but

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,679
doesn't help that much the R&D and it

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:32,230
and these services are the cost is wrote

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,539
down thanks to both to use the job open

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,730
source and the usage of interns and we

00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:40,900
have high level engineers know interns

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:43,090
now and we play by the good rules of

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,309
what good business should be well our

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,289
costs cannot be the cost of a business

00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,240
that is running with interns so it's

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:51,850
it's it and it's tough to compete when

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,039
you're in this case I'm sorry I'm

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:58,480
closing up it's the last night it is the

00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:00,760
last night excellent and so we would

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,649
need to see service companies

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,049
contributing more to open source

00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,570
software that they use and actually this

00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:09,600
is also true from

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,639
companies using massive amounts of open

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,039
source software in the cloud service and

00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:18,690
not necessarily contributing at all to

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:20,850
them and so they there should be some

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,380
sort of measurement of contribution to

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,529
the open-source software that is being

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,100
used maybe that's one thing that the w-2

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:31,769
could do an open source company open

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,669
source associations to do in general is

00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:38,789
measure the contribution that that any

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:41,820
software any cloud company is doing and

00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:43,350
say okay show us in an in proportion of

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,299
your business and because of course

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,519
Microsoft today is a big open source

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,929
contributor but in proportion of their

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:54,299
business they're probably still a very

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:57,059
small one and and so one of the things

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,740
that community in general needs to

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,500
consider the need for the contributors

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,740
to finance their work so it is not

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,059
wanting everything for free when when

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,049
you're in front of an open source

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:12,330
business it is it is actually painful to

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,759
have people thinking that you can that

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,440
you should do everything for free no and

00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,480
you shouldn't do everything for free if

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,139
the open source software is there it's

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,080
already a big giveaway that is there and

00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:28,529
people can benefit from crowdfunding is

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,590
also a way potentially to to help fund

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:34,190
more Andy and that could be interesting

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,190
