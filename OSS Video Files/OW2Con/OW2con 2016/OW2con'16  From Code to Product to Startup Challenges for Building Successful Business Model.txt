Title: OW2con'16  From Code to Product to Startup Challenges for Building Successful Business Model
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	We have mainly two categories of products in the world of open source products, the one targeting the B2C segment and the other targeting B2B.

In one side, we have open source B2B startups facing challenges to build successful and sustainable business models to leverage their open source positioning and to convince enterprises and partners to engage with their products; and, on the other side, we have open source startups with successful B2C products who are facing challenges to convince their large communities to accept even the idea of monetization. 

When the open source startup with a B2B model main challenge is clearly to execute as a software company, the open source startup with a popular B2C product has to deal with a more complex challenge.
I will base the presentation on two open source startups Iâ€™m currently advising. One is a promising startup with an open source platform for building web and mobile application, and the other is a behind a well-known open source product used by million of users around the word.
