Title: OW2con'16 BEYOND OW2: Building the Universal Software Archive
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	The goal of the Software Heritage project is to collect, preserve, and share all publicly available software in source code form. Forever.
By doing so Software Heritage will serve the needs of: Society, by preserving our collective technological heritage; Industry, by building the largest software provenance open database; Science, by assembling the largest curated archive for software research; and Education, by creating the ultimate anthology for programming curricula.
Although still in Beta, Software Heritage has already archived more than 2.5 billion unique source code files and 600 million unique commits, spanning more than 20 million projects from major software development hubs, GNU/Linux distributions, and upstream software collections.
Software Heritage is developed transparently as a collaborative project and all its own source code is available as Free/Open Source Software. Currently incubated by Inria, the project will graduate soon to an independent charitable, nonprofit organization.
