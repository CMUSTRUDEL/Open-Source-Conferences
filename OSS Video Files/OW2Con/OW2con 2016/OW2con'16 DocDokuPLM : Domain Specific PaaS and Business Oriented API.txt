Title: OW2con'16 DocDokuPLM : Domain Specific PaaS and Business Oriented API
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Totally replacing our SOAP web services with HTTP web services behind an API has been a real challenge for us this year. We made the choice to generate our Java and JavaScript API by using Swagger. Swagger allows us to generate a JSON file describing our REST layer services, and thus generate code from this description file. We're now able to deliver a SDK to other applications in Java and JavaScript today.

Using same codebase and same method names are really useful for developers, and modifying our REST layer doesn't mean modifying our SDKs by hand: it's generated! It's quite easy to deploy and/or use: our APIs are simply Maven and NodeJS modules. Having a interactive documentation for all SDKs is really appreciable, it allows us to discover every services and test them.

We can now resolve specific use-cases by developing new applications with this API. Currently our SDK is in use in 2 separate projects and languages (a GUI written with NodeWebkit and a JEE server application), and fits as needed.
