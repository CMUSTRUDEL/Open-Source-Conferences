Title: OW2con'16 Measure It! How to Measure Quality in (not only) Large Software Projects
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	You can control what you can measure: this is particularly true for software quality. Measures means attributes (to be measured) and tools (to measure).
We have a pletora of tools to support entirely the Application Lifecycle Management: companies and communities can leverage open source to set up infrastructures filled with SCMs, issue trackers, static analyzers, wikis, planners, and so on. These infras can become mines of raw quality data: selecting and defining measures, metrics and ways to represent them is core to achieve a complete control of the quality of your developments.
In this talk Daniele will show you the experience in a large software company, involved both in open and closed source projects: processes, tools, measures adopted to let people to deliver software satisfying common quality attributes, shared across the organization by the means of guidelines and a common culture of quality.  This approach can be adopted by companies and communities as well: quality is the value perceived by end-users, who often arenâ€™t interested in knowing whether the software they are using is built by a community or a company. You will see how close this experience is to OW2 OSCAR quality analysis pillars.
