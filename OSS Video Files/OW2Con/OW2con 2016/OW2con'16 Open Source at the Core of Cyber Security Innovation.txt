Description: 
	Our economies are digitalizing with more and more added value coming from the infrastructure. This is also true for one on the main catalyst of the digital transformation, Cyber Security. Due to this digitalization, Cyber Security is also in the middle of a paradigm shift, with many innovations developed in the Open Source communities. In this presentation, we will focus on the two most important of those innovations:
• Cognitive, contextual and behavioural technologies
• Blockchain
Those two innovations with strong Open source roots are now changing the Cyber Security landscape, but are not limited to this as they also changing the business models of several industries.
