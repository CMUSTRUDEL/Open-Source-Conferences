Title: OW2con'16 AuthzForce - Open Source Next-gen Access Control Framework for the Enterprise
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	1-   The presentation will first give an brief overview of the AuthzForce project with a bit of history, i.e. where we come from (SunXACML project), up to where we arrive today (AuthzForce Core and Server); the licensing model (Community vs Enterprise version); and the main features, mentioning the main standard implemented (XACML, i.e. OASIS standard for access control).

2. Then we will present the main concepts and standards behind Authzforce: Attribute-Based Access Control, XACML and evolution from v2.0 to v3.0.

3. We will focus on Authzforce features:
- REST API: multitenancy, XACML PAP and PDP interfaces, policy versioning, Fast Infoset support;
- Extra XACML profiles implemented: REST, Hierarchical RBAC, Multiple Decision profile, etc.
- Extensibility (PDP extensions)
- Code to Product: quality & assurance testing, continuous integration, standards conformance testing, Docker and Ubuntu (.deb) packaging, etc.
- Comparison to open source alternatives (e.g. WSO2 Balana, OpenAZ)

3. Authzforce use cases:
- Thales internal projects
- Collaborative projects (French/European): OpenCloudware, FIWARE, AU2EU, 5G-Ensure (IoT), etc.

4. Roadmap (What is missing)
- Administration dashboard
- JSON support
- More data storage options
- Performance testing (e.g. PDP clustering)
- Other unaddressed needs from Thales internal and collaborative projects
- OW2 collaboration opportunities
