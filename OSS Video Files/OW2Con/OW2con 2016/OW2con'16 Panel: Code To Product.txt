	00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,030
yes so the subject is actually quite

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,910
interesting good to product because it

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:23,369
needed it's it's a difficulty code is

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:28,170
one thing and making it you used by

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:31,679
people and and then be able to to evolve

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:38,370
it to product status is a much more

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,540
complex and ever so I'm not you want to

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,750
go in in the discussion right now or

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,879
well the question raised okay you say

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,239
it's a good thing so it means it's

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,770
something that you'll be confronted with

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,539
with regard to having development don't

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,420
don't buy the community and you as a

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,620
private company having to take this to

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,559
the market yeah so that's the job yeah

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,540
so so actually we have a bit too

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,479
different you we can have two different

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,820
situation in the case of open source

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,229
project you have the situation where

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,420
where where you have people that create

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,110
some some code and actually even create

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,540
a product so or this code is used

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,250
libraries or or product are created

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,780
right away and then the community grows

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,390
around it and then the question is more

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,820
about how to potentially sustain it over

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,090
the long term potentially as a business

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,420
and then you have the case and we're

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,640
more in the second case were we I had an

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,710
idea of something that would be

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
interesting in the idea was to write

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,090
code and at the same time think about

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,759
how it's going to be sustainable in the

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,890
future and and so in the second case

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,159
it's particularly important to think

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,320
about the users very early on so what

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,930
what other needs what what they're

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,649
looking for and to not think as much in

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,960
technical terms what what is the code

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,490
itself it's more about what is a need so

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,110
you need to put the usage as strongly as

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:18,930
as the code itself and and what the code

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,170
does and talk to end-users and one thing

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:27,000
I learned while starting to present x

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,040
wiki's that users don't really care

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,430
about open source or not open source

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,360
they care about getting solutions they

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,980
care about getting something that works

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,050
open source can be an argument that you

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,820
add on top of it but first you need to

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,740
solve the problem so you first need to

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,980
solve the problem and then you can add

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,960
open source as a differentiator but you

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,580
you cannot just come and say oh it's

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,520
open source you're going to take my

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,040
stuff okay does it work like that and

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,080
and clearly and you need to look at what

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,240
alternate solutions are and what is your

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,540
competition whatever it is open source

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,700
not open source and you can be helped by

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,070
people that that think that open source

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,220
is very important and they will favor

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,320
open source solution always but even

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,150
when they favor open source solution

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,910
they were still worked a very good

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,840
solution you can in our domain for

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,950
example we're doing wiki's well and and

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,530
and everybody knows that last yen and

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,320
Duroc conference are used by many many

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,440
open-source believers because there are

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,680
very good tools and you need to be as

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,300
good and and you need that leads to be

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,480
asleep I mean and we're getting compared

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,300
a lot with conference and we need to be

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,580
to be very good so first you need to

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,940
think about your users and what they

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,590
need and so what they what they need

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,310
Thank You the week I think I'll ask a

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,160
silly calburn another of the

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,870
participants within experience in the

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,150
startups in small companies pushing

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,480
products in the market what you take on

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,520
this perspective so far from my tech as

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,580
a director to too long on the user what

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,340
we can see is usually at the proprietary

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,870
software

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:23,360
joseph software organized customer

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,580
advisory board has organized a physical

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,580
event where I think and open source

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,639
market we have more online community

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,090
because internet up as nobody I'd say so

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,960
it's gone from from anywhere and usually

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:45,440
we have less let's say budget in sales

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,930
of marketing so we were trying more to

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,060
use to leverage internet and to leverage

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:56,389
online tools so i think we as a when a

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,940
company launched open source project

00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,220
open source project they should also

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,120
organize try to organize or so a

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,419
physical event and try two two-hour x a

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,680
direct access to to user so it plots

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:18,250
where we can be less good as a process

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:23,630
but i think 22 let's a get feedback of

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:27,919
online survey a bug report from the

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:33,080
users understand the users open source

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,660
community are are very good talent thank

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,460
you now i think the next speakers roller

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,229
rubs and more systems integrators i will

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:45,550
ask jose from experience at atos ahead

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,979
of open source public sector looking at

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,510
resources from the open source world

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,780
some of that some of these software is

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,520
halfway baked sometimes and you probably

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,789
have some experience with regard to

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,099
selecting open source software resources

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:03,139
yeah false first of all at dorsey

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,800
assistant director so we use open source

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:09,470
we don't already contribute and that is

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,690
a bus length okay that is pure and so we

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,430
take advantage of open source but for

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,660
most perspective i think that we need to

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,570
divide it by category i used to say well

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:23,150
go or humanity main scorer everybody can

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,520
access basically apache foundation is a

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,500
good place of code for vanity and then

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,680
well something we got there

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,650
business God mean you can share it you

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,280
can use it but you need to at least 20

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,930
the one who preach this code and the

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,640
last one is what we got your business

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,430
good so when for my toes we know

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,810
interesting about code for Humanity

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:52,640
basically we want code we can reuse

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:54,800
integrated package and reset so my point

00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,830
here is more about family a lot of stuff

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
about God so they're open source is not

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,860
really make any sense anymore from the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,680
business expecting as I say kubernetes

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,820
integral yoga and four so far docomo

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,640
powerful kuga so and we also that you

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,250
have integration with form or or

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,010
different other container so the notion

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,110
of open source is very very relative I'm

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:25,340
more think about out what you do with a

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,190
code but to be opposed so I'm more care

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,290
about code for Humanity to be honest

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,820
then business code but I know that you

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,780
guys need to make money with your code

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,690
so that is also something in water cool

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,520
thing Thank You Gabby array you also

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,710
represents a large system integrator but

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,470
as innovation director you are in the

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,169
job of producing software that will end

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,470
up as product or resources in big

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:55,130
project so what's your what's your take

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,870
on the on the theme co2 products yes in

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,810
general group is about the system

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,410
integrator and producer of software like

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:07,570
spackle bi for the distance so looking

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:10,760
at the two species of this morning a

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:14,330
movie from coach products is not an easy

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:17,870
task for companies probably is just the

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,419
past four major companies as interesting

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,690
to see that google that doesn't need a

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:27,140
community out of Google join the limits

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:32,390
foundation for Cooper Nagus so also a

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:34,789
major company in some way to enlarge the

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,240
community needs the help of an

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,260
initiative

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:45,610
of a foundation of a community large

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,490
open source community the second piece

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,209
of wheeler is different they add they

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,399
give some tools for the warmest of the

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,649
open source code that is for court in

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,279
general but security specific security

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:03,430
like Oscar initiative I can say in the

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,360
Batu does you say that I agree system

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:11,260
integrator is to make business so won't

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,570
save code sometimes in proprietary fear

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,339
but in the open source builder you won't

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:21,100
have a reputation a user community and

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,339
security to be saved that the subject

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:28,630
secure of the good quality and that

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:31,899
we're all the community in helping

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,600
companies moving from code to products I

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:38,500
think that is a very difficult task for

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,940
a company to make this job by itself of

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,060
course you have you're in charge of

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,760
making your product successful because

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,980
you have your goal and you want to reach

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:58,450
your user but the community came out to

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,760
give the awards to another community and

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,670
to help you in the governance to give

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,040
the rules of the game I can see that is

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,120
licensed but also the governance of the

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,149
projects and these are two interesting

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,750
different example a company that giant

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:20,320
linux foundation for a topic that in the

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:25,089
hybrid dr. Cooper Nets a very popular

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,370
now so you don't need to say where are

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:31,570
we going but you move something

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:35,380
different do they give security safety

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,079
on the existing code David where do you

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,630
see what you do at the core

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,060
infrastructure initiative and the batch

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,000
program how do you see the bad program

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,290
contributing to improving software all

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,170
along the value chain

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,279
FFO one thing I didn't emphasize enough

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:59,709
i think is that surely i agree that

00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:01,910
products are much more than just testing

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,519
documentation all those things are

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,069
necessary for users to actually get

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,440
value out of that software and we do

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:12,290
have some criteria about documentation

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,250
so on think one chose that we have is

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,250
that in my mind products should focus on

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,920
user what are the user needs and

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,560
different kinds of users require

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,329
different kinds of things someone who is

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,040
developing software that's fundamentally

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:32,660
a JavaScript library that's the users

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,660
are frankly other software developers

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,550
the hemp means and their users but their

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,449
needs are ver very different than say a

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:44,870
user of VLC or Firefox or Libre Office

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:47,000
which are used directly by end users and

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,329
they have very very different kinds of

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,730
needs same with enterprise software

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:54,410
enterprise software has needs absolutely

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,110
as users and those usually needs are

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,540
radically different and I guess I would

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,639
just appeal I think the criteria can

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,949
help in terms of identifying we need

00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,199
tests but you yet yes I think you need

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,940
tasks you need documentation which also

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:10,310
have to focus on the end user and then

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,130
it's going to be very specific to the

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,850
kind of software will be kind of problem

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:21,139
solving the kind of users that you have

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:24,110
and so on Alaska Craig do you see

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,360
yourself as providing the market a a

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,529
product or is it more an online service

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,750
or something is the product the code

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,240
itself and what goes along with it or is

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,740
it the service of the way you can use it

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,120
online we have product managers for

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,459
communities as an open source thing and

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,410
then separately for the hosted version

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:50,750
of it and so ultimately the the altruism

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,970
behind cumin is is we think the more

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,620
people who can use this thing the more

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,269
dollars are going to come to our hosting

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,840
business it's very obvious from that

00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,240
regard

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,250
but in saying that it took to what a few

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,350
people have mentioned before now with

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,550
the rise of software-as-a-service there

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,020
are a lot of people who are just saying

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,030
well it doesn't mean I am an open source

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,250
house but i'm fine with running on

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,900
github and if you remember a few years

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,460
ago launch pad there was this thing all

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,190
logic has not open source we can't host

00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,320
everything there but do we care about

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,750
github for example either the

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,420
convenience of these things is one thing

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,510
and some companies who have adopted

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,190
communities I think we'll just use it

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,800
whereas other people have said to me

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,320
that they become committed on whatever

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,570
it is that they adopt because they care

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,430
about knowing they can change things to

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,230
the supportability thing it's like if

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,970
you have a commercial package than

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,460
generally you you hope will you trust

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,020
the vendor will stay in business if you

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,550
have a good open source community you

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,040
can trust that even if the primary

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,020
container went away then someone else

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,320
would totally step in and the more

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,470
people use a thing which is one like 22

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,210
why we set up a foundation I think it is

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,220
because we want this to be not like

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,610
there are many single vendor things and

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,530
if you are a single vendor you make a

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,600
nice piece of plumbing doctor is a great

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,130
example of this they built a very nice

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,590
piece of plumbing but there's no money

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,720
in plumbing it's not sexy and they need

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,800
end user focus thing so they're trying

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,050
to move further up the value chain

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,840
without lay they moved away from the

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,760
hosting piece so they're trying to

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,550
product high something which is in large

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,580
part behind the scenes and it isn't the

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,200
end user facing so we can see the

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,830
difference between those two things I

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,140
think thank you so you've mentioned

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,690
product managers the rollers product

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,310
manager it's funny because this is

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,440
something we don't really think of when

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,180
you think of a community and developing

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,410
software and contribution where we

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,520
mentioned contribution we talk about

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:52,610
code contribution bug reports feature

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,010
requirements etc translation and all

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,260
this but product management it's not

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:01,100
something that appears as a role in the

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,320
community maybe it should actually sit

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:09,050
like you've been in a couple of startups

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,070
what is the key what key quality in this

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,680
kind of product

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,370
management or moving the code towards

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,610
the stages of product what could be the

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:22,460
key quality ok test you would highlight

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:25,580
yeah I think it's a good time in 22 I

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,500
liked the need of project manager also

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,450
in opens of project because at the end

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,760
it's a project so it should fit with the

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,610
market so for sure if you listen your

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,270
users but it's also good let's say 12 in

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,710
quiz analyst that no better as a new rap

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,740
the market or that can give you let's

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:47,270
say and as our overview so you should

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:52,450
absolutely invest in a product marketing

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:55,990
also for an open source project and

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:59,720
tannin that nano cloud we do open source

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:05,270
product but we also invest let's say to

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:09,170
learn where we should go I would go we

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,940
you should do some marketing it's very

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,580
important so up for me open source

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,620
software is very it's a project at ian's

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,800
so open source on the top and sauce is

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,290
the same so the project manager should

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,090
at the same time take care to the

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:29,660
community to the users to the customers

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:33,080
that pay to use the software so after

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,330
there is a several model for open source

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,850
for sure for companies that produce open

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:41,630
source but but at the annual you have

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,450
community user you have let enterprise

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,900
users that are paying that are paying to

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:51,980
to to to use a software or that or that

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,950
can be of some help from a professional

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,980
services to do to use the software and

00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,200
and you should have a product manager at

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,920
that they care about all this input and

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,280
also the internal input about I don't

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,920
know myself guys in the company are not

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,189
a new zealand usually an open source

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,580
project we let's say is an only

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,670
developers that pizza cooked and

00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:22,490
we don't don't listen to much with our

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,870
oath of asana okay a little big do you

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,680
want to you want to add something and

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:31,010
then get really yeah there is one thing

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,600
is you you said the open source not open

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,100
source the same thing for the probe you

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,050
need a product manager I agree with that

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,640
we need a product manager however the

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,910
role of the product manager is indeed

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,980
goes a bit beyond and it's in this

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:48,410
because in the end it's in into suitable

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:50,960
you cannot split you what you do in

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,240
terms of what product you build from the

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,470
business model and so the product

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,570
manager needs needs to be very aware of

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,580
the business model of the company and he

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,740
needs to work on both sides he needs to

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,680
work on the part that is open source

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,320
that is free and on the eventual part

00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,000
that bring money whatever it is whether

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,130
or your business model is service or

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,440
your business model is a packaged

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:19,610
product or he needs to be aware of that

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,070
because in in what will in what will be

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,620
done you have you will have to to make

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,450
decisions as that impact on both sides

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,540
and the second aspect is that he needs

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,450
to be a bit schizophrenic he needs to

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,170
think business and he needs to sink open

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,570
source community and he needs to kind of

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,370
think about both of them separately he

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,470
cannot he cannot join them completely

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,960
because you you're not talking business

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,060
you're not talking business model in

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,120
your community you're talking about the

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,370
what you're building and and so the

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,130
product and he needs to work there and

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,590
so well attics wiki we didn't always

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,650
have one person that would do both for

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:03,320
example our CTO is the community leader

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,510
the clear community leader it's the CTO

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,940
but he needs to be a product manager if

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,310
he is not product manager if it doesn't

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,100
if he's not strongly involved in the

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,530
business model of the company he's going

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,940
to just work on the code and he's not

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,400
going to think about what needs to be

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,430
done anything like that so and and I was

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,030
more than one driving the the business

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:28,350
side initiate but I'm also very involved

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,880
in in open source if I'm not

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,580
get the split and if you get the split

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,880
that's not good so you you you you need

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,010
to work on both sides of the defense you

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,210
need to work on open source on the

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,760
product and you need to work on the

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,370
business model should if you split at

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,289
some point it's going to you might say

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,260
well why am I doing this open source

00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,970
code if the business doesn't see that

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,350
that doesn't get involved in the open

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,210
source part so the business needs to get

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,520
involved in your sauce part and the open

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,380
source part needs to be aware that the

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,200
business is necessary for their to

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,150
continue to exist and so you need to

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,549
have the product manager work on both

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,830
sides of things at the same time for

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,720
example at the tricky we for example

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,480
when we think about the roadmap we

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,750
involve all all teams of the company of

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,549
the company to decide what would what do

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,799
we want to do and then we bring it to

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,780
the community we bring that and then we

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,059
discuss it in a comedian that's what our

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,980
CTO is doing so first we discussed

00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:29,309
internally what would what do we want to

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,659
invest on our sources so our team and we

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,820
bring it to the community so that the

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,780
community can also participate and and

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,280
and extend the word so you have this

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,799
double work that you need to do which is

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,179
not not always simple it's not a simple

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,580
process okay so you really combined and

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,110
same efforts into the commercial product

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,010
and what you call the community would

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:55,830
call the community code has to be yes it

00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:00,659
is very thorough really thick the role

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:05,520
of the prod manager in the chain from

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:09,059
code to profits a usually speaking of a

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,669
sorcerer usually the metaphor of the

00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:17,370
game like a soft soccer game a football

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:19,650
game so usually you have something you

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,210
want to achieve to win the change the

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,000
European Championship the world

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,350
championship or just to stay in the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,950
major league I don't know you have a

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:34,559
goal you have the user and like a normal

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:40,090
team you must have it the trainer the

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:44,529
manager of the team and yes to lose at

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,360
the capability of his team you have a

00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:49,779
core team that you have a broad team the

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,080
community so you have emphasized your

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:55,840
qualities recover the defects solve the

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,000
issues that the road is a different role

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,460
of a traditional I'm system integrator

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,620
so I know what the president traditional

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,679
company is a little bit different from

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,179
the traditional product manager role is

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:15,820
a bigger latter role because you must

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:20,320
balance different levels of performance

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:24,100
but you have a yoga in the mind and like

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:29,529
modern teams you are not alone you need

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:33,190
the assistance the second trainer if you

00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:36,120
look at major teams or you have some

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,649
specialized in communication because it

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,590
doesn't exist a problem editor that can

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:44,679
do everything you need some assistant to

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,990
help you but with the role of balance to

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,960
emphasize your qualities I recover

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:53,350
detects looking at the brother to me of

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,220
course you have a good Co team and a you

00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:00,279
have a two to rely on this I don't know

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,750
if you have a difference yes yeah I want

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,580
to quickly comment you know when you

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,039
mentioned earlier that a mini project

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,529
open source software projects don't

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,870
necessarily have a product manager but I

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:13,750
would view product managers as a whole

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,049
not necessarily a title as long as there

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,720
is someone whose job is to focus on who

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:21,940
the users what do they need how can we

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,620
ensure that we get the users what they

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,460
need I don't care if they're actually

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,350
called a product manager or someone else

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,570
there are many people called release

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,940
managers or perhaps an object manager

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,309
and so on depending on that project as

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,169
long as they're focusing on what are the

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,179
users what do they need how can we make

00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,010
sure they get that including the

00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:45,010
documentation are shorts that the

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,200
testing is Banerjee achieved made of

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,720
things that we've discussed here then

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,850
great and if they're not meeting the

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,860
user needs well that's a problem need to

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:57,040
fix that so right so incoming

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,260
management's in development since the

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,090
contributors also the users they can

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,070
also it means what you're saying is that

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,830
the role the function of product

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,720
management is not identified under one

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,670
hat but it's probably spread out

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,520
throughout everyone is a little bit of a

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,990
product manager it could be I don't have

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,700
any trouble with it being a single

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,799
person in fact off tonight it's helpful

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,350
down someone at least looking at it and

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:24,220
say we need this we have a problem in

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:27,190
this area and helping people point

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,020
towards and improving that area but I

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,940
just would not want to get messed up on

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,980
that particular phrase it's the

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,870
importance of the role being of jeep

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,290
being performed I think row j want to

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,120
try something yeah first I think we need

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,250
to be careful when using product manager

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,710
because we can also say portico know but

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,500
the same thing for me we talking about

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:50,470
open source for traction a community to

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,270
action why so I think is important to

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,049
the phone if you are targeting bid with

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:59,559
b2b or b2c so if you're brilliant B to C

00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,110
code you can have a big great put

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,640
product manager you know how many

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,040
gurantee that you going to our culture

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,440
so and I like what you say we need to

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,950
support us on our product manager need

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,500
to our kind of visibility understanding

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,410
of the market is targeting so I think

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,630
having contact with analysis quite

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:22,360
because as yen you put coat on on public

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,790
and you expecting people in belusi to

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,710
comment to say oh yes great I want to

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:29,350
contribute if you don't have no

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,360
guarantee of that so now if we move to

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,160
be to be it's definitely different

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,049
because your target in business so you

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,240
don't need culture basically you don't

00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:39,640
need to have the use number contributor

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,410
to make reasons why so it more care

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,270
about your product so in this case is

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,900
more product management you need to

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,780
define walmart and quality and so on so

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:54,280
basically your core contributor are your

00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,480
employee don't know people also that was

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,610
very important when you talk about

00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,310
product manager Apollo canova what are

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,320
you tired we don't leave orbit and then

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:07,060
define your own map and is a different

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,190
story Craig one says something I'm

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,390
curious to understand if at communities

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,060
because you're the one who really

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,580
mention product management and if Fred

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,700
management came before or after what was

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,840
role in more is primarily consequence of

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,910
having something that seems to be

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,590
working and then you say oh we we need

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,690
to make a bring a little bit of

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,060
structure to that and let's hire

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,200
somebody and give them the title of or

00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,660
her the title of product management

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,170
manager did he come before or after

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,670
ticket to gathering there's there's a

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,610
couple of different industry ways to

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,470
think about this like to everything lose

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,630
it like when you have a product manager

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,550
generally that is a person who has the

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,550
authority to tell people what to build

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,530
and thats like in microsoft i think they

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,990
call program managers so the company

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,640
decides i want this to exist or this is

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,350
the goal i want to meet and then to do

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,980
that then they go and say hey

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,660
programmers go make this happen and

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,330
google traditionally it's been a little

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,070
bit more engineering lid so people will

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,600
just build things and then if a team

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,820
gets traction behind wanting to do

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,310
something then they'll bring in the

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,050
product person to help to shape that but

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,060
a lot of what we have is we have this

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,860
cool internal technology how do we turn

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,520
this into being something external

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:24,460
facing in the open source world the 22

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,530
erogenous it the the question is do you

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,210
have people you can control and have

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,920
them build what you want and generally

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,560
that's because you pay them somehow and

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,450
if you are a company that says like this

00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,850
release will have these things in it

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,530
then either you need to pay the people

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,810
to build them or hope that all the

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,670
individual contributors are going to say

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,130
I are going to work on that because I

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,900
want to and they that's when it becomes

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,500
more of a community task of saying well

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,950
is there a life do I have if I say these

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,700
things will people build them and you

00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:00,400
get PDF felt kind of figures who are

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,500
able to be of an endpoint for escalation

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,120
or you have councils of elders or

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,920
technical advisory boards or something

00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,590
but ultimately it's a little bit like a

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,420
film director it's if you have someone

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,640
who says this is my vision this is what

00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,860
I want then you need to have people that

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,630
you

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:19,280
hey to build their for you in whatever

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:22,280
currency or you need to you can ship it

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,720
what people do and then hope that like

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,400
you you can just say well this release

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,860
because this person was interested in

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,940
this that's what we built and the

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,640
distinction I think will be very

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,870
different depending and if you have paid

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,299
contributors wanna thank you I have the

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,760
feeling that we've been threading onto

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,860
forbidden grounds by talking so much

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,730
about product product management product

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,440
marketing in the conference which is a

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,090
open source and technical so maybe some

00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,190
people say well they're talking about I

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:57,260
mean what more talk about the technology

00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:00,140
and code do we have I mean we have ten

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,179
minutes left and I there is one thing I

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,280
would like to know something about it

00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:07,130
while there's questions what can be the

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,440
role of a non point source organization

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,870
like what ability to to support the

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,669
market readiness of their project that's

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,490
something we have a vested interest here

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,320
this is why you're here sitting and we

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,020
asking you these kind of questions we

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,150
want to improve body so w2 and we want

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,040
to improve our project helper projects I

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,710
do have questions while you think about

00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,750
this one do we have questions from the

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:36,340
room please and we should have a

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,340
microphone the flying microphone is

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:47,090
there it is you the grower nickel our

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,520
ability product owner for Mongoose I'm

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,860
by Allen solutions and also president of

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,820
Linux afford a dog the best website in

00:29:51,860 --> 00:30:00,410
the world so I heard interesting things

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:02,450
but not so much about fail and how does

00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:05,900
the country in the communities that you

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:09,380
address linked with fell because they

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:12,559
contribute to the influence in the

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,710
buying process so they are part of the

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:21,890
pipeline is that ruin so how the

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:26,020
community helps build sales really what

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:29,110
who wants to take this one can take

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:33,170
there is firm is there is a different

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:35,690
different way well as a community we

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:38,570
will l and it depend also the software

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,960
if the software it's a let's say for

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:45,140
end-users the community can give it back

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,260
its first very variable second can test

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:55,750
the software with both bags and and for

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:58,750
me that can be a very very benefits I

00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:02,240
don't think any open source project

00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:04,850
needham let's say a lot of contributor a

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,200
lot of cod a lot of pto developed by a

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,720
by the committee sometimes only adding

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,950
feedback and bug reports can a great

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,830
help let's say for sure the company

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,150
should offer some poor we're under hood

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:24,350
have some developer that will develop

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:26,750
the project but in this case it can be

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:29,630
enough on other case the community can

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:32,480
also develop someone let's say specific

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,220
use cases specific let's say connector

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,550
are deepening to their own use case and

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,160
we will be a belated to extend the core

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:43,940
values that the company bring to the

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,640
twos open source project so the company

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,750
focus on already so the coffee features

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,060
and community can build on top of that a

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,510
lot of extension so for me there is

00:31:53,060 --> 00:32:00,440
multiple answer what could be what is

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:03,770
very important is when a living says a

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,400
product manager should take care about

00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:09,020
both community and business and ping

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,780
user from its it's very important

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,490
because there is some company where and

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,850
I think it's a big mistake when they

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,980
want

00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:21,150
moneta nuys which they want they want

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,380
the one that lets say push a lot of the

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,620
business because it's a business that

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:30,300
wheeler let's say these are the growth

00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:32,040
of the company and year after year they

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,380
remove some material from the community

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,630
on pettis and the enterprise to have

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:43,620
more and more users at the end in fact

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:48,420
the community will we left or in for the

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,950
project the community will die as they

00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,380
will not answer will not have any

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,260
benefits from the quanity at the end on

00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:00,270
factors open source project will become

00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:01,770
let's say a trial project with a green

00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,170
project you will not be able to go and

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:08,010
click sure and you will not be able easy

00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:10,170
to use it so I think it's very important

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:13,620
to take out to the community if you want

00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:16,020
also have some benefit from it Kim rj i

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,300
could a quick one now if we're together

00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,830
just to make this clear it's time to

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,870
understand that people will contribute

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,270
most of the time are working for

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,130
companions I don't believe that people

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,650
contribute on the pencils are individual

00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,960
we were just ok so spare time and want

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,730
to grow from this one if you do that is

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,700
because you are some pure Posada but

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,890
most of contributor today are they are

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,990
implying from combine you of India's to

00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,650
contribute that I believe that if you

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,150
talk about Bill you see is defined

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,210
availability used you most of the time

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:51,000
you are recording what a company be

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,880
honest is finished I think it's time to

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,090
think that I'm at third applesauce in

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,770
1995 and I was like oh inhibitor people

00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,450
contributing because they're like oh

00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:03,000
pencils they want to bring stop to

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,360
humanity now I think it's time to

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,620
understand that his business ebony TWC

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,270
his business you okay a fine final word

00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,870
now we're stopped with the video we can

00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:17,970
then Gabrielle a and look maybe the

00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,150
world what cannot be to do if you have

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:23,260
first unlike what would be wise for us

00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:27,250
but maybe I'd like us to

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,990
say one more thing that was not set on I

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,940
mean you you have three types of

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,909
community you have the contributors you

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,120
have the technical aware people and then

00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:40,120
not and then you have users so actually

00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,679
the users their posts they're a bit

00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,159
dangerous when they're when their

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,659
community because they are not

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,580
experienced and and they give you a lot

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,040
of information but they also tried to

00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,929
ask you for stuff for free a lot and

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,210
they can be dangerous so you need to

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:58,030
identify people that don't understand

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,130
that your time is not free and and they

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,590
bring they also need to bring you value

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,390
with if they want you to bring them down

00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,590
so and so sometimes they can be

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,070
dangerous at the same time they're

00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:12,550
potentially your clients so it's a

00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:15,250
complicated thing but actually the most

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:17,200
interesting people are the technical non

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,150
contributors this is technically a

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,910
community because they're your pre-sales

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,620
actually so the people that will bring

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,680
your software inside companies where

00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,020
it's difficult to get in they will not

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,360
bring you money initially but they can

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,240
bring you money on the long term so the

00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,370
actually putting seeds in in some places

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,790
and so we had some cases for example a

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:42,840
bag putting X wiki and both suppose

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:45,550
three years later whether the guy left

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,710
when when the guy was still there there

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,870
there he was doing the support they

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,910
didn't need any support but when he when

00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,500
he was done the people that were there

00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,680
they were lost was the software they

00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,620
needed support so you there your seeds

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,420
for the future and they're also your the

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,520
people that that will make your software

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,260
known they will identify the right

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,630
software that the company should use and

00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,010
then maybe they will give it to the to

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,590
the business guy and the business guy

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:14,380
will say well I cannot put this without

00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,150
proper support maybe you will say well

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,800
if we can do everything for free great

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,650
let's do it and then you won't do

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,230
business but if he says well I need I

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,240
need proper support to to do this you

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,400
will call and called the company's okay

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,110
how can we work together and and then

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,390
you will do business so they're your

00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,789
free sales that you evaluate Thursday so

00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,130
they bring a lot of value from from the

00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:39,859
sales and marketing process but it's not

00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,010
fast it takes time for the seeds to

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:48,319
transform into business now what could i

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:51,650
order you to do and well I think on the

00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:55,099
product side well maybe make make users

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:57,349
meet with with with with the software

00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:01,430
provider and make more contact between

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:04,760
users and and and the the company's

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:07,579
coding and bringing software what w2 is

00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,279
already helping making the market aware

00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:12,440
of open source and presenting companies

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:16,069
but maybe more meetings could be

00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,200
interesting on vertical subjects thank

00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:20,720
you never just one aspect about

00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,789
community community give reputation to

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,160
projects I just to say what my

00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:28,220
colleagues do in my company when they

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,760
have to make the choice of a versus

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,420
proud proud project they look at who is

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,690
behind the projects Apache comfortable

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:42,740
Google comfortable OpenStack comfort or

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:48,170
eclipse could be 0 W could be so they

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:50,990
add reputation to that project in this

00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:54,009
sense is very important a process that

00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:56,720
is hidden toward the end user you can

00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:59,029
looking at the other two if you want to

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,549
enter it over to you can you submit a

00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:04,279
profit but it's not automatic there is a

00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:06,920
process to be accepted inside the

00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:10,009
community that's why community give

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:14,150
reputation and add to like governance

00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:17,900
like quality expressing something else

00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:21,490
so it's an important aspect that

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:26,210
community keep reputation to the privacy

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:28,700
sometimes for the little company is not

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:33,230
the automatic go to the business if they

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:36,049
do it alone typical if I make me a few

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,880
miserable person if you I would like to

00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:40,290
respectfully disagree but not that

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,680
strong I there are absolutely

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,300
who contributes are not and your

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,210
contribute to various projects on the

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:51,690
other for some for many projects there

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:54,000
the vast majority I remembered seeing a

00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:57,840
study this is require a while back but

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,770
is the apache server they had thousand

00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,990
contributors one of them was unpaid okay

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,660
so they exist in so many projects

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,040
they're vanishingly small majority after

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,800
some other projects it's a larger

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,440
percentage but that said a vast number

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,270
of developers today are paid to develop

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,640
software that's releases open source

00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,220
that's a good thing I do not think that

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,070
open source software paella is a

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,990
business model it is a licensing model

00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,000
and a way of collaborating there are

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,670
many different kinds of business models

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,920
then people have applied and it's okay

00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:34,140
but they're different between different

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,090
projects because different projects have

00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,270
meet different needs have different

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,400
kinds of users but whatever it is if

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,990
stop working then they need to change it

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,730
until it is working and so hopefully

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,840
loved it so I would advocate for is if

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,120
what you're doing right now isn't

00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,920
working look for something else it is

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,440
there are many examples of many

00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,810
different ways to approach the problem

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,550
of making it something long term is

00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:03,630
affordable and there are ways to solve

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:10,050
it thank you to leak anything oh you got

00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:12,900
push a nice world so thankfully spawn I

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:15,120
have a chance to be advisor for to open

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,340
source project one is BLC the gods

00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,800
beyond VHC so you guys know about the

00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,980
air COI and AB another one was Wakanda

00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,890
is a open source b2b and the LT is open

00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,270
so busy so and it's quite interesting to

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,630
look about it because when I look about

00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:33,510
BLC the core contributor only one God

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,880
will pay actually see other guys are

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,390
working for video labs who's the company

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,490
p on VLC and former Wakanda one over a

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,840
percent of the contributor are employed

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:48,840
so now the question is about the

00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,990
business these are the same challenge to

00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,930
make in question and the community rui

00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,230
this community

00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:58,359
us so but as yet how the b2b you need to

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,460
make money somewhere and then your video

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,130
see because the company beyond the video

00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,079
see need to be sustainable so some ways

00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,329
and it also to think about okay guys we

00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,819
need to make money to be able to keep

00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:11,260
going so I have the talk they stopped to

00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:13,540
learn about these two burner because

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,059
it's quite challenging today to lead

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,790
between a b2b start up for bida with

00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:20,650
company and the video see open-source

00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,260
companion so they are different channel

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:26,200
but at the end they need to be community

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:29,290
to action but is a key if you don't have

00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,140
community if there are questions okay

00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:35,770
except if you are Spargo bi or companion

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,680
or the app a customer bed as a beginning

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm quite sure when Spago Pia or bonita

00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,559
start many many years ago the first

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,829
focus was about community Thank You

00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,569
Craig final words but what's an

00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:52,540
organization like admit you can bring to

00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:54,160
a product is a shin yeah give only given

00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,250
everything we've just heard there I

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,680
think the people will individually

00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,299
contribute to open source if it's

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,829
something that they use themselves I

00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,780
don't think very many people are going

00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:07,740
to wake up and say I'm gonna go haircut

00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,240
whatever project today that they just

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,130
maybe as a program and challenge but

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,869
nothing else so if you have a large

00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,790
audience of people then a certain

00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:17,230
percentage of them may get involved and

00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,480
projects i've been involved with and

00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:21,520
pastor things that I used in they didn't

00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,740
work properly and so I would try and fix

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,099
them and around the edges maybe maybe

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,380
more about packaging and so on as one

00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,970
final pieces that I used to go to a

00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,609
linux users group I was involved with

00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:36,970
which would have been 15 years ago this

00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:38,200
time frame now and it was back then as

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,440
like let's all learn how to compile a

00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:44,829
kernel and what you get from that group

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,690
changes over time and we found with like

00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:48,700
I don't really know I think meetups of

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,490
the new linux users groups but we found

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,829
that very soon you get the people who

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:56,170
were paid to do the stuff for work knew

00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:59,109
all the what I call the 101 level stuff

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,579
and then the wig old guys who were like

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,560
I've just learned about computers and I

00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,780
don't want to pay bill gates and

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,910
those people need to have introductory

00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,860
things and you need the people from the

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:11,530
first group to train the people from the

00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:14,170
safety group but if you just get them to

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:18,190
keep doing that introductory stuff then

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:20,260
they will drop off so your your bar

00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,840
keeps moving what you need to do keep

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,600
changing and my only suggestion would be

00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,370
think of how you can fit both groups

00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,870
possibly by running two different

00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,880
streams for things because because one

00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:32,080
stream will never fit new people and

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,340
advanced people and keep them both

00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:39,750
engaged good thank you very much so

00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,750
