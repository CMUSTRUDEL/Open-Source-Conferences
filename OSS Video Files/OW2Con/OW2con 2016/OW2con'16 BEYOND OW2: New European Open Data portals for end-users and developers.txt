Title: OW2con'16 BEYOND OW2: New European Open Data portals for end-users and developers
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	In November 2015 the European Commission officially lunched the European Data Portal http://www.europeandataportal.eu . The mission of the portal is to become the catalogue of all European public data providing them in all official languages of the European Union. The portal is harvesting metadata from heterogeneous open data portals of 28 EU and other 11 European countries. It lists over 580 000 datasets and it is the biggest Open Data portal worldwide. From the techincal perspective, it is the first official Open Data portal implementing the new DCAT Application Profile specification. The portal is the place to find European public data and it is a basis for other innovative services. One of them is Policy Compass https://policycompass.eu. It brings together open public data, social media, e-participation platforms, causal models, and argumentation technology for constructing, sharing, visualizing and debating progress metrics and impacts of policies. Both portals are Open Source. They provide rich APIs and may become a data source for other applications.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,349
I have to introduce myself once again

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,780
because I'm playing now another role I'm

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,059
you're a Glickman I'm research it from

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,770
fo-fo-focus in the limbs of ram prefer

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,109
maybe you heard about it it's the

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,109
biggest european organization for

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,539
applied research which consists of 68

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,980
institutes around Germany and the world

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,720
and I belong to digital public services

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,120
department where I lead the group on

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,860
open service engineering traditionally

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,440
they are producing a lot of open source

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,390
code and we are doing many solutions for

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,840
public sector and not only for public

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,239
sector and one of our key topics at the

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,940
moment is open data where we we are

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,010
quite active in Europe and not only in

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,629
Germany and today i represent you

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,460
briefly two projects which we are

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,920
developing which are not the part of

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,629
audible to yet but potentially can

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,110
become a part of 0 w to code base

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:06,720
because both of them are open to us and

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,150
of course you probably seen a lot of

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,740
such lies like this one about benefits

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,400
of open source where are different

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,869
aspects open source is still topic

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,610
important topic in europe and not only

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,920
in europe and also in other countries

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:25,759
and we're a social economic and also

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,280
performance benefits in using open data

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,540
from one side to open data helps public

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,500
administrations to become more

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,290
transparent to the citizens but it also

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,229
builds provides a certain base for

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,329
innovative development so so developers

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,149
can develop and create innovative

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,950
applications and i believe many of you

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,460
are already using kind of transport

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,890
application so local information

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,570
applications which are very useful and

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,729
which exists thanks to innovative

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,920
developers and of course also to

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,570
companies or public administrations

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,970
providing visceral data

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,770
and from an outside also public

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,780
administration's can benefit from cell

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,030
from from such data because we can

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,890
improve our processes and can use all

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,280
service date and where work we should

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,590
still a challenge for them and it sounds

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,660
may be simple but in reality where

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,400
public administration's organized in

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,650
such a way but it's very difficult for

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,060
them to to establish process of

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,970
publishing open data because we need to

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,340
decide what kind of data why have who

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,000
have has to select the light sense who

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:41,170
needs to give gold and so on so it's

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,050
it's very difficult process and European

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:48,190
Commission takes a lot of actions and

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,530
help in Europe the countries in Europe

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,080
to to publish more detail stablish such

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,690
processes and one of these initiatives

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,510
is the European date European data

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,239
portal which is now religion project on

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,420
open date in Europe which I'm represent

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,080
and this European data portal has to

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:12,010
become remained hub for all public data

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:15,489
in Europe so where portal is online

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,519
since November last year and the project

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,410
is lead by capgemini consulting and my

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,930
organization front profile is

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,140
responsible for managing the data so far

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,150
we are collecting data processing them

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,489
and providing all met data management

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,340
functionalities in the portal when I

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,959
speak about data in reality what we are

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,660
doing we are working with metadata

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,519
because data stay in volitional portals

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,980
where we are published we don't want to

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,980
duplicate data but we are collecting

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,079
metadata which is also not trivial

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,260
process because of interoperability

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,480
issues multilingual little issues and

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,660
all possible issues I wish you can

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,720
imagine in public administration so what

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,299
we do so at women we actually harvest

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,930
data we use word harvests the harvest

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:11,079
metadata from all the European data

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,750
portals at the moment with European data

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,440
portal is the biggest sopan data portal

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,769
what why

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,040
right we have over 600,000 datasets

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,770
which metadata we provide in 15

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,530
languages and the this is for now but

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:30,550
later we will increase it up to 24 so to

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:34,240
cover all European Union languages so we

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,240
already harvested the data from 34

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,550
countries from over 70 catalogues so you

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,060
can imagine well where a lot of

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,330
different portals in Europe and way

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,690
provide not all of them provide any API

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,360
in some cases we provide REST API

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,430
sometimes it's a sparkle endpoint

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,490
sometimes you can download well catalog

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:05,740
as a single file sometimes we provide

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:08,140
RSS feed so kind of IT guys around

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,160
Europe are very innovative in a way how

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,780
ways provide access to where data and

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,100
our mission is to collect all this data

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,320
and bring them to a certain recommended

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,070
metadata standard which is decayed

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,560
application profile for structuring

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:30,280
metadata in European public portals and

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,890
we are wonderful first big portals which

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,950
is actually implementing this profile

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,200
actually we are we first one but a bunch

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,350
of this work technical work and

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,570
developing and maintaining this portal

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:46,930
we also supporting data publishers and

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,280
data users so we are showcasing we are

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,860
training we are providing training

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,840
materials so we are doing a lot of work

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,000
so the technical work is about fifty

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,120
percent of all project all our fifty

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,190
percent is about helping data publishers

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,500
to prepare data to organize where

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,680
processes to train them to help them and

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,050
also to help communities to find the

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,430
data to find new possibilities regarding

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,250
data reuse so for example we published a

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,010
good book for data providers where we

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,680
explaining what open data is how to

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:24,190
build on open data strategy how to

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,039
implement it how to organize this life

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,650
cycle of publishing data which is not

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,660
the trivial

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,280
sing in public administrations and how

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,530
to monitor the success of all the

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,039
separations so we are doing it we have a

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,889
very good unlike curse prepared by open

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,190
data institute from UK which is a

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,110
partner in console soon and we collected

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,639
a good library of information materials

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,430
so i recommend you if you're interested

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,600
in the topic to have a look and reuse

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,250
all these materials are under open

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,090
license so you're very welcome to reuse

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,800
well and regarding the portal itself so

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,100
as i said already we are harvesting

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,889
moment from 17 open data portals we are

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,720
supporting with new and implementing

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,320
this new specification which is decayed

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,120
application profile translations also a

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,560
challenge we are using machine

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,900
translation service of european

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,180
commission we have one of where test

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,570
users of this new service mode for sure

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,820
you know google translate but it's

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,919
something similar useful implemented and

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,490
provided by european commission but only

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,460
for european commission public services

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,460
and we have one of a project which has a

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,710
privilege to use with service so we are

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,750
using it and the base of our

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,169
repositories seeking from open knowledge

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,860
foundation maybe you know it and we are

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,449
providing also a set of tools to support

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,810
portal owners for example we have open

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,669
data lights as an assistant helping them

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,770
to understand open data license is

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:01,070
similar to open source world with open

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,599
data also where a lot of licenses not

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,860
all of them are compatible with your

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,020
shower and it's very similar to open

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,539
source it's not so easy to choose the

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,699
license and here especially it's a

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:18,010
political decision which is usually

00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:18,010
taken by certain public administration

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,490
regicide under which license we want to

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,289
publish where data and sometimes where

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,780
even the reinventing licenses or

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:29,510
defining new licenses which is of course

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,779
as we know from open source not a good

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:36,469
idea but it's sometimes politicians we

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:38,089
have let's say own arguments why we do

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,110
it and it happens

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:44,449
and also what we are doing we are

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,809
providing us a tool to check the quality

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:50,329
of metadata which we are collecting from

00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:54,110
reporters so we're portos owners like in

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:56,240
Germany or France or in Spain we could

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,779
have a look what kind of mistakes we

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,779
found in where metadata very so typical

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:05,420
like broken links of some information is

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,879
missing some photos don't provide any

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,620
description for where data Oh some

00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,519
obvious way provide only description but

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:18,980
no data so it's where are all possible

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,230
combinations of problems am but in

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,439
general such portals where like search

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,709
machines we help people to find data and

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:30,980
you find data you download file and what

00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:33,589
you find inside you know only after you

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,249
open it in our case we also provide some

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:39,439
visualization like some some charts so

00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:42,980
you can visualize some types of the data

00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:47,269
but of course not all types of data but

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:52,069
very built let's say a basis for more

00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:55,639
user-oriented applications and it could

00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:57,620
be kind of app or portal and one of such

00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,589
applications which is relying on with

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:03,230
European data portal is a policy compass

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,910
policy composes a research project so

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,429
European data portals not a research

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,720
project it's a project implementing a

00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:14,350
tender oh it's a commercial project

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,059
under tent of European Commission

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,179
implementing a connected Europe facility

00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:23,360
program and policy compositor research

00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:26,509
project and the idea of this project is

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,600
what by using open data and heaven

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,540
information about performance of of

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,300
different aspects in different aspects

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,449
of life people could judge about

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,189
efficiency of policies political

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:43,009
policies so where are a lot of

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:45,139
information about unemployment about

00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,779
criminality about different aspects of

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,840
life which are published in in

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,140
statistical agencies like eurostat exam

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:59,690
or some others and the idea is to

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:01,940
combine it with with certain tools allow

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,000
people to define all metrics of

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,320
performance and look on this data from

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,720
critical point of view and try to

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,180
understand what actually happened in the

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,500
past was a certain policy a success or

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:18,320
not and so on and in policy compass we

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,560
operate with with six main types of

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,190
contact content so first of all users we

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,710
can upload own data sets in our case its

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,200
policy converse works only with time

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,400
series data so with statistics for

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,330
different period of time like

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:41,780
unemployment for example and so users

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,490
can visualize with data and can bring in

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,810
visualizations different types of data

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:51,050
in one chart and we can also annotate

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,690
them by events by historical events like

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,710
chilling policy change in events when

00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:02,450
government introduces to certain law we

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:05,150
can show it in the same graphical chart

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,800
and the users will see what happened

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,760
after some time after introduction of

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,890
this low if something changed or not and

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,400
and can compare with other country since

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:19,160
this is the idea and users can define

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,770
own metrics as mr. magical formulas can

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,950
bind several different data sets in one

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:30,710
metric and also charted basically and

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:33,110
with theories to which users can we can

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,880
define as causal models explaining

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,850
whatever relations between different

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,880
concepts like between unemployment and

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,300
criminality or between unemployment and

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,610
drag consume consume and so on and of

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,340
course we can discuss so this platform

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,500
is good for unload atta journalists

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,320
where you can prepare your stories and

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,120
export them to online articles we also

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,150
implementing this functionality so you

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,100
by clicking you can export it directly

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,200
to a certain online platform like

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,970
Facebook or

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,820
some hours but if I look a bit more in

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,930
detail when very difficult step is about

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,600
uploading data sets because all these

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,540
public agencies will publish data in

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,750
extremely different formats even if it's

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,810
a comma separated value file it can be

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,130
formatted in a such different way what

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,100
it's impossible to import it

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,080
automatically you need to look inside

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,970
and understand semantical minion

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,940
otherwise it does not work so we

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,420
implemented a very user-friendly wizard

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,510
which helps users to upload these data

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,600
sets and built them and we are

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,240
supporting when the most popular formats

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,730
at the moment and interesting feature is

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,190
what we can search from policy compass

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,980
directly in two main sources for such

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,610
data so in European data portal and in

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,500
eurostat and find with data sets and

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,560
they also import metadata directly from

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:10,330
the photos which is difficult and now

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:12,850
one part is about events so where is no

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,670
such a big for open there are many

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,090
projects but where is no such a registry

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,460
for events you cannot find somewhere

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,500
registry where would be information

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,580
about what kind of policies changed to

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,120
bend where or when was a certain crisis

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,940
and so on so it's difficult so it will

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,590
mode we're using Wikipedia and DBP ID as

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,350
a source so we are analyzing also

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,870
texting Wikipedia and we are able to

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,490
extract events from Wikipedia articles

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,940
because in Wikipedia you still have

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,650
quite many events but where we are not

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,320
in structured information by just in

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,440
text so we have a special text

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,990
processing tool to extract social events

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,390
and we are building such registry so we

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,580
have integrated registry and we can

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:06,280
visualize data as I said bring different

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,770
basically data in one chart we have we

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,750
support different types of charts and in

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,530
this choice you can easily see certain

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,730
trends you can see what after for

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,670
example as soon

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:23,920
as a export of of where points22 Middle

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,440
East increased sometimes ago two years

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,980
later always people run out of the

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,709
region so it is clearly scenery felt

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,690
three times we have such example three

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:37,320
times in past history we could see it

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:40,959
but approximately two years after

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,570
retirement contract start buying weapons

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,079
in a certain region people starting

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,810
leave leave in the region so it's kind

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:53,170
of clear message of course it's not a

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:55,360
proof it just helps people to understand

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,269
data and also find something new and

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,040
build this theory and discuss so this

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,040
platform it doesn't provide any proof

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,320
because we don't have enough data the

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,269
statistical data which we get you get

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,180
like one number per year or maybe per

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:16,000
month which is not enough for four to

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:18,310
claim any real correlation but it gives

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,069
you idea and helps you to understand

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,839
things so please build a theory and we

00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,350
have interests in metrics manager where

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:31,300
users can define metrics themselves and

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:34,089
can calculate new datasets based on risk

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,120
metrics so you can define your own index

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:40,329
of happiness calculated for yours for

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,670
yourself and compare very people happy

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:47,949
in one country or an hour so this is

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:51,160
idea yeah and always serious and how

00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:53,920
different things in what I related to

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,690
each other can be summarized as a causal

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,959
models so in such a type of graphs and

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:05,020
we can do certain prediction because we

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:08,290
can calculate where it weights based on

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:14,260
historical data and we can predict how a

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:17,439
system will in evolve if certain values

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,169
will be changed like if you in your

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,760
system you are changing unemployment by

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:24,490
decreasing it how it will influence

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,250
other aspects of life yeah and in such

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,900
model it can give you certain

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,640
qualitative prediction in which

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,930
directions

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,400
our concepts will go and finally two

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,990
important components we have with

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,910
deliberation we are using that Hawk

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,120
receive software which is also open

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:44,720
source software and the way I where

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,580
outcomes of these discussions and

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,850
deliberation we formalized as a

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,590
argumentation maps or graphs with help

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,350
of Carnegie software which is also

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:58,440
another open source software which we

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:02,190
are developing so it's to define

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,370
arguments in the form of formal

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,950
augmentation so I welcome you very much

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,520
to visit both platforms the address is a

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,290
European data portal point you and then

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,680
I want policy compass point to you and

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:20,370
both are open to us and both provide

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,290
very good API stressed api's so if you

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,000
are interested to develop kind of April

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,740
and on such type of data you are very

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,740
