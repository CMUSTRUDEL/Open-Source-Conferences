Description: 
	In November 2015 the European Commission officially lunched the European Data Portal http://www.europeandataportal.eu . The mission of the portal is to become the catalogue of all European public data providing them in all official languages of the European Union. The portal is harvesting metadata from heterogeneous open data portals of 28 EU and other 11 European countries. It lists over 580 000 datasets and it is the biggest Open Data portal worldwide. From the techincal perspective, it is the first official Open Data portal implementing the new DCAT Application Profile specification. The portal is the place to find European public data and it is a basis for other innovative services. One of them is Policy Compass https://policycompass.eu. It brings together open public data, social media, e-participation platforms, causal models, and argumentation technology for constructing, sharing, visualizing and debating progress metrics and impacts of policies. Both portals are Open Source. They provide rich APIs and may become a data source for other applications.
