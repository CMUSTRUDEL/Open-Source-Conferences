	00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,610
we will the nillian myself present you

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,019
an update of and the description for

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,750
some of you who don't know about it of

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,140
the technology cancel the other will to

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,410
conceal technology cancer we will first

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,900
describe the console itself right we

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,039
will then introduce or remind you about

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,450
the projects that join the code base in

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:36,239
2015 and 2016 this year we will give you

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,660
a short update about the quality program

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,820
which is called OCR then we will give

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,530
you an update about the collaborative

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,289
engineering platform and all the

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,809
infrastructure that we run at a w-2 for

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,420
serving the community and helping to

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,610
build and test continuously the software

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,489
that you are you you build and then

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,109
we'll end up with the other way to

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,690
international programming contest that

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,699
some of you will discover maybe so first

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,810
of all we will remind you about the

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,000
console itself as you can see it's a

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,510
community the core idea is to bring

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,010
together Hanson practitioners and open

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,189
source project leaders of the other

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,290
value to project code base together as a

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,070
community which is both European and

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,740
Chinese from now so Daniel a is from

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,860
engineering IT solutions architect is

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,650
the new chairman of the TC since this

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,350
year Yeah right and I'm the I'm here to

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,509
manage and organize the console itself I

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,920
will let you Daniel a seat just a few

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,360
words about the collaboration that we

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,329
have been having this year which has

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,960
been very fruitful right yes it was very

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,880
fruitful and I expected that it will be

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:53,250
fruitful also for the for the future

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:57,479
because my experience every technology

00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:03,750
council meeting we we meet every two

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:05,640
weeks almost our chance to to learn for

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,899
each was a chance to exchange

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,470
experiences and this is a very important

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,850
factor

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,520
goes in this way community can roll can

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:23,100
grow with the experience of how the

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,200
participants and I learned a lot in this

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,910
few months because i was elected the

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,880
last spring and it was a totally new

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:40,740
experience for me and it's also a way to

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,440
see what the others out the other made

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:49,050
their work in the open source world and

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,860
a way to to share the value within the

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,760
open source world so i invite you of

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,380
course all the project leaders to to

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,740
participate because i remember you that

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,910
all project leaders can participate in

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:11,670
the technology council to some months

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:16,620
ago we made a survey because there were

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:19,739
a lot of people who didn't participate

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,290
yet in the technology council and of

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,140
course the technology council is open

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,920
for for all of you i think it's very

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:33,810
important is and one thing another

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,350
experience was 22 touch concretely how

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,600
strong is the collaboration between the

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:43,260
management of all w2 and the community i

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,630
had a lot of support from stefan from

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:52,769
the management and this is another very

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:54,510
strong and important thing for us thank

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,700
you thank you to you Danny they were

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,500
very proud to have you the technical

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,630
config your chariot and you bring a lot

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,019
of new energy into it and a lot of

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,739
knowledge as you master measurements

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,640
metrics and all the BI tools that we can

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,080
put on top of these software engineering

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,880
assessment tools to bring value to the

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,950
project leaders that is what we're

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,109
trying to do right so as you said we

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,840
have having meetings what do we do in

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,300
these meetings mostly are you submitting

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,430
right online chat

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,860
discussions every two weeks we have four

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,330
major axis in the TC that you can see on

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,280
this picture the first one is to make

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,129
sure that the project's life cycle is

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,990
running fine that is what are the new

00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,729
project that we bring in does it make

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,550
sense with respect to the existing

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,520
community how major are they can we make

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,680
them move to the major level so this is

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,199
what we discuss we also discuss about

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,360
the tools that support the quality

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,819
program itself Oscar program that who

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,699
will remind you about it in a minute we

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,949
also make sure that the collaborative

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,590
engineering platform is up to date and

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,729
cutting-edge enough for me to meet your

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,909
needs in terms of software engineering

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,949
we will show how it evolved and we're

00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,319
also currently actually working on the

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:13,280
programming contest that is currently

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,050
ongoing first of all let us remind you

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,669
of the project that joined the code base

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,330
this year you have seen some of them

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:25,039
earlier warp just joined as Bruno said

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,380
on Tuesday I think monday or tuesday we

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,770
had also seed start last week we're very

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:34,069
proud to have those two and earlier this

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:37,400
year in the open cloud cloud segment we

00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:40,729
a no cloud also prelude in the

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,550
presidency ative fusion directory vespa

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,650
and amix s workflow which is a new

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,009
workflow engine in the code base because

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,990
we already had bonita which is

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,060
lightweight and focusing on

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,629
microservices it's it's backed by a

00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:01,639
german company and is doing business

00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:05,960
there we had also three new project

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:10,789
recognized as major the first one this

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:14,419
year was Lucas the second one quite

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:17,000
recently was prelude and last 12 weeks

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,849
ago I think was fusion directory so

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,520
congratulations to all of them and as

00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:24,500
Professor wheeler mentioned yesterday

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,240
about the improvements that the best

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,069
practices Victoria brought to the

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,770
project we will mention just a few words

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,750
so that what's changed the process

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,030
brought to these projects first of all

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,220
for us as far as i remember we

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,020
made the continuous integration reports

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,720
more public right by the time it was

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,750
continuum understood it is about to

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,240
change or will give you you will let us

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,060
know prelude same thing the bill but

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,420
reports where by the time before getting

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,560
made sure the project had internal

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,810
continuous integration reports which

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,540
were made public during the process and

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,910
also the code was submitted to a service

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,310
base by sonar source which is called

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,860
sonarqube commits an online version of

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,980
sonarqube running free for open source

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,650
projects now including prelude as for

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,690
fusion directory also this the

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,950
continuous integration reports became

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:21,370
public the sonarqube reports got also

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:24,500
online and it was a good occasion to

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,410
integrate the release of PDF document

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,150
ations within the release cycle and to

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:34,040
publish the documentation on the other

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,680
belittle fault now let us bring you an

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,690
update about the quality platform itself

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,370
that is called Oscar standing for open

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,850
source software capability assessment

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,670
radar it started as quite a few years

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,940
ago and became a scroll this jar it this

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,920
year it features now scorecards

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,500
emphasizing key scores reflecting the

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,550
majority of the projects you will see

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,630
them in a minute and we evolved the

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,550
underlying model the open-source

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,130
maturity model and recently we started

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,970
to cross analyze this model with the one

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,730
of the CII batch program and their best

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,250
criteria we presented the program at the

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:17,120
first m and during civil ad hoc

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:20,090
workshops in Europe here you can see the

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,990
new score cards that we introduced this

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:27,320
year as an output of the riscos project

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:31,550
featuring scores about license analysis

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:34,700
quality and activeness as for the

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,100
open-source maturity model it evolved

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,820
from spreadsheets through web forms and

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,140
it includes now new extensions covering

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,650
cloud deployment

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,680
and now we are we just started I think

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,080
earlier in December to rationalize omm

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,410
with the best practices criteria we had

00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:00,060
a meeting with David and part of the

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,880
team and a foul ghost so obviously as

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,420
far as we can tell these are the two it

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,860
is one of the two major initiatives

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,620
together also with key taboo is

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,340
promoting a maturity model to cover the

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,740
project it's not yeah to two major

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,530
initiatives so we're comparing them as

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,410
far as we can tell the omm has more on

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,210
academic background whereas best

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,480
practices criteria is more industry

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,420
based so far it has also chosen more

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,760
closed answers why omm focuses on

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,900
intervals that is something different

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,130
and we identified that omm covers

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,650
specifically the standards compliance

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,480
the cloud deployment aspect and the way

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,970
stakeholders and requirements are

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,190
managed while the best practices which

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,570
area has a strong emphasis on security

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,520
and also on static analysis of the code

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,830
so we are we are starting a detailed

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,620
comparison of the two model the two

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,560
models and the one of the idea that came

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,980
up would be to evolve the open-source

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,350
maturity model of a w-2 by taking into

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,080
account some of the ideas of the best

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,840
practices pretoria and conversely to

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,940
contribute to the model from the omm

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,000
side and at some point in order to

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,700
emphasize the demetri chi and the badge

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,970
that each project gets we could publish

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,670
the part of the best practices criteria

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,790
within oya member directly on the best

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,040
practices programs through a potential

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,700
API not sure if there is one already but

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,550
we can certainly discuss this I guess

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,430
now in terms of the ongoing work

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,830
regarding the dis quality program first

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,680
of all there is this strong and very

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,690
powerful idea of that got presented this

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,730
morning around accessibility obviously

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,190
this is something that has to be taken

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,520
into account when evaluating the

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,240
maturity and the market readiness of

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,830
because as almani LTE told this morning

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,790
we should all consider that

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,830
accessibility non-compliance can be seen

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:10,730
as a bug somehow it's not the concern of

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:12,830
just that the people who are not able to

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,510
access it the concern of the developers

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,400
so we should put the emphasis on this

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,690
and certainly we will include this in

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,140
the maturity model and also include the

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,450
tools for assessing this progress toward

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,300
accessibility in the Oscar platform and

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,240
enabling new project leaders to

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,150
integrate the accessibility concepts in

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,430
your production workflow and measure

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:41,170
where you are with your user interfaces

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:44,270
with the compliance with accessibility

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,270
we also intend to continue our

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,400
collaboration with the CII batch program

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:55,490
by further cross analyzing the models

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:58,280
and by having a billet contributions and

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,910
we will also continue to include new

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:05,030
measurements and dashboards for bringing

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,310
high-level views of the projects and in

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,820
this specific aspect I think that is

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:14,270
very important to to share experiences

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:18,050
because I I think that every company has

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:21,770
its own experience in measuring quality

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:25,660
of its products or projects so this is a

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:30,380
very critical field where the

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:36,410
collaboration between all the other two

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:38,330
members can make the difference did now

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,490
let us give you another view quick

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,890
overview of the evolution of the

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,190
infrastructure itself which is obviously

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,840
very important when it comes to software

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,630
collaborative writing we've been working

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,390
on maintaining the existing services but

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,130
more interestingly in specifying a new

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,220
user management service that will

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,730
describe a bit Thank to fusion directory

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,960
we are in the process of setting up

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:09,470
gitlab as a new tool to manage the code

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,900
no this is excited for many of you and

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,420
you're waiting for it quite early we're

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,640
doing our best to make it reality as

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,710
soon as possible and in parallel we are

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,650
also very lysing the infrastructure and

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,810
as a matter of fact it's more related to

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:27,470
online collaboration but we were happy

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,750
sponsors of the announcements of X wiki

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,790
real-time editor which is developed by

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:36,740
party by a team that is represented here

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,140
issue you really should give it a try

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,880
it's extremely useful for internal

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,950
collaboration around a common knowledge

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,500
me quick overview of what we're working

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,530
on regarding the user management service

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,080
we add a legacy infrastructure that you

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,350
can see here where the management of

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,780
fuses was very scattered the management

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,450
of organizations as well which means

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,510
that the members cannot update their own

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,850
data and that we have an absent

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,510
registration system as you can see here

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,090
we have to ldap said all SQL database so

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,590
it makes the whole management quite

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:21,590
complex so this is why we within the TC

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,200
and we the management office and mostly

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,080
I'm after and also leave nothing with

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,600
the sysadmin of a w-2 we start in the

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,270
phase where we listed the requirements

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,970
for a new user management service we

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,480
needed and convenient solution to manage

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,190
a w2 users and groups which was l delta

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,190
based obviously because this is a

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,040
standard for authentication today with

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,740
web service endpoints modern web UI and

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,380
a clear password single sign under to

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,300
the TA creation and access control so we

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,430
evaluated several open source solution

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,880
that you can see here the three main

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:01,820
ones worth for troika glue and fusion

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,340
directory and we selected fusion

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,860
directory which in the meantime became

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,650
another volatile project and we are very

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,650
happy about it so the new target

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,650
architecture is much more simple as you

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,250
can see here all tools get connected to

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,520
a single ldap

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,830
over lemon ldap instance which will

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,230
manage the single sign-on and we use

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,720
vision directory in combination with a

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,330
plug-in that we sponsored as well to

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,620
manage the users the groups and the

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:38,370
organizations in animal genius manner

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:41,730
directly over a web user interface so we

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,950
thanks open sides for their support and

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,150
also to model from subway funny news and

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:50,160
project contributor of lemon ldap for

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:55,020
helping us progressively reach this

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,670
status what are the next steps where we

00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,370
will bring this infrastructure into

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,800
production we will virtualize the other

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,310
belief infrastructure setup this gitlab

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,430
instance that is being waited for and we

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,350
will as you so much some of you so

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,650
yesterday the presentation of stamp this

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,660
new age 2020 project which is about the

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,280
automation of test or the ability to

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,680
will provide infrastructure for this

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,540
project making it possible to automate

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,130
further the deployment of containers

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:32,160
undermanned for testing the uh TT

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:34,890
project or part of them last activity

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,589
that we are working on in the large

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,410
scope of the technology council is the

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:43,380
contest this is an initiative that runs

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,170
every thought every July since a few

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,910
years it it is currently ongoing I mean

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,770
that the work is finished but who are

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,830
evaluating the work delivered by the

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,260
competing genes which are mostly from

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,390
China and working on other will do

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,880
projects but driven by other Chinese

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,860
project leaders at the moment so we're

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,079
working closely with the Chinese

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,290
professors involved and they will be an

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,720
award sermon in October so as I said

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,380
it's mostly focused on on China so far

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,959
so for the country's 2017 an idea that

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,959
pop up within the technology council was

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,880
possibly to help the project leaders

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,530
first of all to get represented within

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,079
the google Summer of Code which is

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,850
something that cannot be ignored in the

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,140
field of initiatives that target

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,840
students today in the field of

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,630
open-source software and

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,690
another idea would be to try to address

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,820
more the university professors in Europe

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,669
so that they get to know better the

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,029
other value to projects that would be

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,919
possibly support training material

00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:48,799
support for the students including in

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,799
the open source school obviously and and

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,919
bring the student community closer two

00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,870
hours both for MOOC and general

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,720
awareness about the community and also

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:04,460
for direct contributions to the code if

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,919
possible I think we covered it most a

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,559
beta tester thank you very much for your

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,559
