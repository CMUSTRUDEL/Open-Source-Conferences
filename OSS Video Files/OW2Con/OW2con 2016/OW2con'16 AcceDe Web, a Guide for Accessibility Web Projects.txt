hi everyone so my name is Dave in my I'm

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,280
the accessibility consumption for item

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
embarrass and I'm going to talk about

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,449
the exit web which is a set of

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,930
open-source guidelines for actually

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,210
practical activity guidelines for a real

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,480
project actually so there's a lot of

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,430
available guidelines already and if

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,610
you're into accessibility Oh Phoebe

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,559
already try to build a website or an

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,020
application with some accessibility

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,149
you've been through way tags of course

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
which is an amazing guide line from the

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,440
ability to treat see if you work for the

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,219
American government you have to go

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,050
through the section 508 which is going

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,370
to be replaced by wake at some point

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,680
we've been talking about it for like

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,809
three or four years thinking of course

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,780
there's one in France energy double-a

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:04,549
and one in Quebec and actually many many

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,840
mores and there are some some guidelines

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:11,280
government guidelines all over the world

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,040
and pretty much based on my keg the

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,850
thing is that there are not fit for

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,979
project management and are there if you

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,549
if you talk to a project manager or web

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,430
designer they might have some issues

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,200
mastering the those guidelines because

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,720
it actually quite technical and you have

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,880
to go through all of different accounts

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,710
and to understand what kind of label

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,210
should I put on this image or this

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,430
button so we've decided at some point

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,860
being excessively GX between with that

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,110
we had to work out with companies and

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,329
make website more accessible and we've

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,430
realized that in the project it wasn't

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,140
that easy to actually just there wasn't

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,579
any available guidelines to third date I

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,680
have an issue and I want to fix it right

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,420
now but have lots of issues to work on

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,129
today and accessibility is only one of

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,619
them so we've thought about that and

00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,910
we've gathered a bunch of French major

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,680
companies into a workshop

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,500
and asked them if they wanted to work

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,270
with us on these guidelines to build the

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,460
first set of web web accessibility

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,210
guidelines suited for project management

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,270
and by this i mean that's our project

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,730
oriented so there are easy and

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,740
understandable you don't have to go it's

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,890
not i mean i love the way cogs and it's

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,620
e to go under all the time being an exit

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,440
visa expert of course but I've was in a

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,900
web agency before I've done athyn and I

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,240
had kitchen all the question all day

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,990
about what should I do with the slide

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,630
show how can I make it accessible and I

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,820
said what was real helpful because there

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,280
was a paragraph about slideshows and I

00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,230
just had to go through the code and tell

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,590
my developers were to what you do and

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,470
what was expected and there is synthetic

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,380
in operational so every members of the

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,540
team can go on a paragraph let me show

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:14,070
you one of those this is from the design

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,210
and UX guidelines and that's the whole

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,450
guideline for this for this matter

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,190
actually you have to provide skip links

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,950
so if you're a designer all you want to

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,080
do is remember to provide skip link and

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,390
there's a tip of course saying that it

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,550
doesn't have to be displayed on screen

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,190
every time and there's a screenshot to

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,080
tell your words and a skip thing is and

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,790
that's all you will need to know at this

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,209
point and the in the design process and

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:46,300
they're adapted to development phases so

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,160
we've actually wrote for guidelines to

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,600
make sure they were adapted to every

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,870
profile working on project teams on web

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,760
web development projects I so the first

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,280
one is for graphic and UX design and

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,020
it's completely code free I mean there's

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,260
not a single line of code in this one

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,140
and there's just a few rules that you

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,300
should check in your design process to

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,190
make sure that you're not going to face

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,430
issues in the next process of the

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:20,200
production second one is for HTML and

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:24,100
CSS which are the basics codes and basic

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,690
sneeze that mostly of all web project

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,360
will need to go through

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,690
third one is for rich interface

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,610
applications so it can be carousels it

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,350
can be tabs and things like that so any

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,790
things any patterns that are actually

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,520
close to real applications and that we

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,260
can find on the web you'll find some

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,050
information about how to make them

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,480
accessible and this guideline and force

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,240
the fourth one because you've been

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,090
working on making an application and the

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,160
websites really accessible you won't

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,750
want to go back in two years and find

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,180
out that it's not anymore because

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,970
editors and contributors didn't know how

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,510
to keep it accessible while updating the

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,240
contents so we made it at 4.2 to make

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,460
sure that those editors knew how to keep

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,860
the website accessible and of course

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,580
it's a template so the idea is that you

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,650
can download the template change every

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,420
screenshot for depending on the ecms

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,820
that you are using to make sure that

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,540
your users will be comfortable reading

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:34,060
those guidelines and of course being

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,210
here today it's open source which means

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,910
that you can use it whenever you however

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,580
you need it to so it can be split into

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:48,430
pieces and put into your quality process

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,890
into your back tracking process or just

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,460
you could just send the lengthy g-men

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:57,070
ask them to to watch in and take a look

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,520
so I'm going to go through a few use

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,040
cases actually really short one to give

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,490
you an idea of what those where are

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,460
those guidelines on how to use them this

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,650
is the actual one of the actual science

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,960
/ website and I've been actually working

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,250
on it and while I was in an agency

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,770
before joining us on and in the end I

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,020
graphic and UX design guideline we asked

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,169
to provide different visual states

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,450
feelings the role of the state is quite

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,230
obvious of course but we also asked for

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,539
the focus states to be designed one of

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,330
one reason is that you might not want

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,759
the classic dotted order

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,280
on on your focus dates because it's

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,009
sometimes it's just not it's not might

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,500
not be easy to you to read and to see on

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:50,229
screen especially in this content here

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,750
if we had the simple dotted border it

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,340
wasn't wouldn't be that easy to see that

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,099
I'm focusing on something so the

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,810
designer the developer state and also

00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:04,120
the the focus state and on the second

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,830
guideline the one for HTML and CSS we

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,020
asked the developer front-end developer

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,659
to make sure that the state the focus

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,719
state is visible so we make sure that

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:16,690
this rule will be followed by two

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,240
guidelines and when the developer gets

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,580
the mock-ups the the graphics design he

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,229
already has the state so doesn't even

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,319
have to think about how to make it

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:29,319
visible it was already taken care of in

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,949
the last stage of the project another

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,529
case also involved in designers care

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,150
assaults there's one very important

00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,520
guidelines that says that you should

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,289
provide a way to pause any animation on

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,599
the screen because it can be difficult

00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,199
to focus or you won't have the time to

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,330
read in some circumstances and the thing

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,819
if you don't do it in the design stage

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,430
when it gets to the developer parts

00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,770
you'll just try to add a button

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,240
somewhere but it might not cover the

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,009
graphic design of the company you're

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,349
working for so again in the graphic and

00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,750
UX design guidelines we asked to provide

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,870
a way to stop animations so it's quite

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,300
simple and in this case we just had to

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,089
add a simple pause button we had the

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,400
client validate this false button before

00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,690
when T to production so everybody was

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,699
okay on this on this matter and in that

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,039
fourth guidelines which interface

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:31,150
obligation we have a site about

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,579
slideshow so we have all the basic HTML

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,919
code all the JavaScript and keyword

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:39,070
behaviors that is defined we don't go

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,380
into JavaScript code because you might

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,479
want to use any kind of framework you

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,360
want to use well we just say this is

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:50,100
what is supposed to be happening and use

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,940
your furniture to do it as you want

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,810
one last case on this website we had

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,430
some college issues and those are the

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,370
orange pink green and blue polo's are

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,009
the cause of the client and when our

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,449
designer start working on the design he

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:08,699
knew he had to use those colors but

00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:11,160
there's a rule saying that you should

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,810
make sure that the contrast between text

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,040
and background is high enough to be

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:19,500
readable by everybody so art design I

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,910
used this simple color contrast analyzer

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,069
tools that you it's free to download

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,850
online and you have the link in the in

00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:29,519
the guideline to check all those colors

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,160
and well we had we were failing on the

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,730
orange worker in the pink failing on the

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,329
green and on the blue so at the design

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,279
stage the design was able to warn the

00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,380
project manager and to go back to see

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,699
the clients and see what what should we

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,709
do about this because we're not going to

00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:49,470
be accessible fully accessible if we

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,149
keep those colors so because we were in

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,509
the design stage it was actually really

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:57,660
easy to simple as simply as I simply ask

00:09:54,509 --> 00:10:00,389
the UX designer and the design it sit

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,730
together and find a way to add enhanced

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,670
contrast button in the in the website

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,699
interface so we've just added validated

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,100
with the client and anybody now on the

00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:16,040
website can switch follows to darker

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,230
colors that will be more visible so

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,069
that's it actually was quite faster than

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,139
this your previous ones the right the

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:27,149
whole idea about exit valve is having

00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:31,009
the right information Wendy in it so on

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:34,889
all stage of the production process and

00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:37,230
it's it's can we transform into a

00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,470
checklist for each project steps once

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,740
the project manager manager gets the

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,930
designs you can go through the exit web

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,029
guide line and just check if everything

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,910
is ok we did I provider a break

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:53,189
did I did I check the colors is

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,889
everything okay for the next team to be

00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:58,290
actually just focusing on developing the

00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:01,459
website and don't they won't have to go

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,459
back into the design stage

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,900
it's an easy way to include everybody in

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,980
the team into accessibility issues and

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,620
accessibility optimization efforts as if

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,280
you ask a web designer to go through the

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:22,020
way calc notice guidelines and he might

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,910
be a bit lost it's going to the design

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,160
guidelines from Excel web is actually

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,760
quite simple and it's just a set of

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,710
rules that they're actually going to

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,990
help all the team make the website a lot

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,060
more accessible which is really

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,760
important and of course it can be like i

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,040
said earlier adapted to fix any existing

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,450
quality process so you can use every

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,910
otha guidelines and every recommendation

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:51,630
into into whatever quality process you

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:55,710
have going on so we can finalize those

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,900
guidelines on accident info the thing is

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,330
the English version is available but

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,070
it's not the one the most up-to-date we

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,260
are currently working on translated in

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,800
Federation to to have an up-to-date

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,560
version if you are interested or

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,140
participating or just you want to know

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,170

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,089

just for information we also did the

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,520
same work and actually the first work

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:32,520
was on PDF document and we have access

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,520
via that covers accessibility for PDF

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,380

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,710
PowerPoint so that's it for me today
