Title: OW2con'16 Dependency Management and Licence Compliance
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Code reuse is a major aspect of Open Source and most development languages have developed dependency management systems to enable this practice in a more efficient and secure way. Licencing is another key aspect of Open Source, as it defines it as such. Convergence of those two aspects is then somehow natural and is embodied in the metadata of the package systems. Combined with the general evolution of licencing compliance and its closer integration into development workflows, this angle seems to gain relevance but is still facing limitations, due to (lack of) metadata quality.

so basically I'm not a lawyer I'm not

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,340
really a technical guide time

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,380
approximately in the middle and so when

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,230
I cross-presentation I thought it could

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,990
be interesting to just ask ourselves

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,289
actually why should we care about a

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,210
license compliance can seem obvious but

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,450
I think he has a question sorry worth

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,690
mentioning and for me is a good answer

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,360
it's to respect yourselves will because

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,530
we are in free software and I think the

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,420
wheel at the toy is really something

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,520
that matters I mean license it's not

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,340
just an administrative sex it's really

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,899
the reflect of what the odor allows you

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,989
and wants you to do in exchange of its

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,399
code that is giving you for free so for

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,039
me I mean thinking about companions out

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,219
this way it's really not this diet

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,000
earlier I mean wait what we should try

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,760
to have in mind so of course there is a

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,350
regimen risk management signed that

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,520
matters and I know that it can be useful

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,860
to use it to trigger some unblock down

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,570
situation but really should not come

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,890
first I think that whenever we think

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,770
about licensed companions we should

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,659
really think about what did they I auto

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,000
asked me to do so maybe the most

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,040
interesting part is this hook is a this

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,570
link recently on the linux kernel

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,850
mailing list there was a heated

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:45,450
discussion about enforcing a GPL license

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:49,710
and so while it was hinted because a

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,479
little falls to patent it and in the end

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,079
he admitted that yet a little bit

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,540
overreacted and that they finally both

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,110
agreed but basically what they agreed on

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,840
is that a legal action should really be

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,869
the last resort I mean when everything

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840
is fail you can go in 20 years and what

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,750
will they were senior so that compliance

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,170
issue it's not a single lawyers it

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,840
should be

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,640
also a singer of developers and didn't

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
want to have a meeting with lawyers they

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,870
said okay we will only have a kernel

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,900
developers at the sprinting and that was

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,650
very important for so I think it's also

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,090
very important to remember that and

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,940
comply legal compliance it's not a

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:38,010
simple lawyers but for developers and

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:41,459
users and also what I have noticed that

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,660
long years the years sorry in legal

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,030
compliance focus has changed and at the

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,640
beginning people were very focused on

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,230
detecting open source because they

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
didn't want to have a open source in

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,870
their code and now and everybody has

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,280
some and so the main goal is to know how

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,220
to manage it if we go back to the schema

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,989
tour presented at earlier the first

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,100
stage is a shot-putter components and

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,480
then you care about code snippets and

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,799
could the bets has always been a great

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,310
for Chris I mean as beginning but now

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,390
people realize that the most important

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:26,430
thing it's more so properly handling so

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,760
data components so we have this gradual

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,980
for Chris even if we have caves case

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,630
like that I don't mean it's obvious for

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,859
everyone that's the rent check function

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,829
that caused so much debate between

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,640
Oracle in Google so its trade local and

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,950
is as stupid as you can imagine it and

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,290
it's nine lines well eight if you don't

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,750
count the closing brackets and it adds

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,239
huge impact so yes I mean case like this

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,459
exists but that is a really really the

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,109
exception so we shouldn't be too

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,299
obsessed by those cases because and

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:06,780
they're really masking the reality which

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:11,639
is also linked to the technical reality

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,130
its package management that now in most

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,030
languages you manage your dependencies

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,850
automatically I mean if you are if you

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,600
could enjoy i will use maven if you cut

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,570
interest reduce cargo exit alex da and

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,120
in all the dependency management system

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,200
you have metadata about dependencies but

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,270
also about licenses so it's very easy to

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,290
get all the licenses of all project by a

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,800
simple recursion and we have already a

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,840
lot of tools that actually do that and

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,640
one advantage of this approach is that

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,890
it's also something at a developer

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,780
levels I mean it's the same tools that

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,360
you develop our use you don't need an

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,220
extra 2 which is specialized in a legal

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,530
stuff the programs that we have room for

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,810
improvements and it's not that much a

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:09,090
two level but adds a quality of the data

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:10,800
I run a quick test and so I didn't get

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,960
exactly what I want but you can stop our

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,710
program that for the first compliment

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,080
you have no data so that's just the

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,880
first thing you should remember also

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,150
it's that when you package yourself

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,670
please I mean mention the license that

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,030
you use I mean I don't take much time it

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,560
helps a lot the other problem is that

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,560
you can see that you have the MIT

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,040
license and z MIT license which is

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,520
actually the same thing and if you go to

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,830
a this.d for you see you a tree we have

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,710
two licenses where EPL are 10 and

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,140
algebra 3 but does that mean that I have

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:55,520
to respect both or can I respect one of

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:59,460
them only and solvation is a script that

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,250
in Jenkins they wrote to fix this kind

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,990
of program so our problems that we would

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,090
need a standard for a license name and

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,390
license items fires and the good news is

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,240
that we never so that's what was

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,810
mentioned earlier so as police everybody

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,330
knows extra it's already okay so please

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,389
use it and that's it

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,389
