Title: OW2con'16 Dependency Management and Licence Compliance
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Code reuse is a major aspect of Open Source and most development languages have developed dependency management systems to enable this practice in a more efficient and secure way. Licencing is another key aspect of Open Source, as it defines it as such. Convergence of those two aspects is then somehow natural and is embodied in the metadata of the package systems. Combined with the general evolution of licencing compliance and its closer integration into development workflows, this angle seems to gain relevance but is still facing limitations, due to (lack of) metadata quality.
