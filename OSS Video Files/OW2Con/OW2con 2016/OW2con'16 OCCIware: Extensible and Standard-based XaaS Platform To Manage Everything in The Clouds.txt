Title: OW2con'16 OCCIware: Extensible and Standard-based XaaS Platform To Manage Everything in The Clouds
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	The OCCIware project aims at managing in a unified manner all layers and domains of the Cloud (XaaS), by building on the Open Cloud Computing (OCCI) standard. OCCIware Metamodel formally specifies the main OCCI concepts. Today a first EMF metamodel is defined that adds to OCCI new concepts such as Extension, Configuration, and EDataType, addressing some limitations of OCCI.
This session highlights OCCIware platform two main components:

- The OCCIware Studio Factory, allowing to produce visually customizable diagram editors for any Cloud configuration business domain modeled in OCCI using the OCCI Extension Studio, such as the flagship Docker Studio ;

- The OCCIware Runtime, based on OW2 erocci project, including the tools for deployment, supervision and administration, and allowing to federate multiple XaaS Cloud runtimes, such as the Roboconf PaaS server and the ActiveEon Cloud Automation multi-IaaS connector.

This talk includes a demonstration of the Docker connector and of how to use the OCCIware Cloud Designer to configure a real life Cloud application (a Java API server on top of a MongoDB cluster)'s business, platform and infrastructure layers seamlessly on both VirtualBox and OpenStack infrastructure.

so lucky well as it has been said is an

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:21,180
extensible and standard based x KS

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,369
everything as a service platform to yes

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,269
manage about everything in the clouds

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:32,270
and it's what i'm going to talk to you

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,820
about first short introduction then

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,690
about okie dokie standard but also what

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,690
what you wear your to work product then

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,570
i'm going to introduce a real-world use

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,950
case to make things interesting in the

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,800
philips Mars city by trying to bring the

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,230
power of big linked open data and latex

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,550
to help monitor energy consumption

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:06,650
important field in this era of climate

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,460
change and I'm going to do a quick demo

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:15,140
hoping that it's not gonna go haywire

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:19,560
show you live to occupy blockers to you

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:22,590
obviously the aki studio itself me

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,460
tomalo and custom developed link to that

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,150
extension for the specific field

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,369
business to may not smart city and

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,350
before concluding about what will be

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,280
coming up next for you wear a lot of

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,850
exciting things obviously so okay where

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,340
why okie why you wear and there is a

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:49,950
problem in the field of cloud computing

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:53,280
and okay i think everybody here may have

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,630
different opinion about that the depends

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,560
on what you mean on what you think cloud

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,780
means

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,939
just can we love things for different

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,970
people can mean infrastructure it can

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:10,390
mean platform can application it can

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:16,660
have meanings in very specific niche

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:20,500
fields in software fields but if you get

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,840
the big picture there are a lot of

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,080
answers to the cloud computing problems

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,440
but there are maybe too many answers and

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,420
that's the problem I think for

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,239
structural level you have standards but

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,670
you have too many of them and the menu

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,930
on the most used one and is an SBS API

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,130
is not even an official standard a

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,440
platform level where you have no

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,440
official standard and you have a lot of

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:58,650
api's by each and every provider add a

00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:01,090
new code hungry open shift and all pass

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,760
technologies this morning we're talking

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:09,340
about companies and at the application

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:13,030
level well it's even worse you're up for

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:16,510
yourself trying to create the glue for

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:20,010
everything to work together it's a

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:26,079
free-for-all it's a and those rates here

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:30,579
so the part of a key is to try to

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:33,519
provide you know a unified view over all

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,829
that a very simple one at that there's a

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,569
little primer about the open cloud

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,500
computing the face which has been

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:44,769
designed by yogi working group within

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,470
the open grid from and has been working

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,139
production for several years iÃ±aki

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,019
everything is either resource or link

00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:55,600
for instance at infrastructure level you

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:58,690
can have compute resources that's

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,190
virtual machines and storage resources

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:07,689
that's disks and if you want to mount a

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:10,379
disk onto your vm well you just have to

00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:15,040
create a link that

00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:17,199
links the storage to your compute why

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,570
it's going to be available and it's the

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,710
same at platform level with the

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:27,160
containers databases and database link

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,840
to provide a database to application at

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,669
application level and even at business

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,490
configuration level for instance if you

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,940
have Ricky talent software et Chandon

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,840
clarification when you get a new

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,440
enterprise consumer because a new

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,139
enterprise customers sorry well you

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,389
usually don't only have to provide the

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,630
infrastructure and software resources to

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,580
him but also to configure his account

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,169
we'd for instance the billing

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:05,620
information very important for you to

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:08,650
survive as a company so that's ok so

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,600
right fine if it works in production why

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,770
ok where why do we need anything else

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:19,810
well because standard is wait but if you

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:24,130
want adoption and if you want such meter

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,410
model to scale up an extension being

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:30,450
built for it because the world point of

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:34,300
it is that you've got it it's extensible

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,700
you can add your own attributes at

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,080
infrastructure level for instance you

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,720
can provide a SSD or SATA disks or you

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,910
can design a whirl new extension for a

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,729
wall new layer that is your own business

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,360
domain layer well if you want to be able

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:55,300
to do all that you yourself that is only

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,510
a qualification provider that don't want

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,810
to be a cloud provider all the way down

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,229
to infrastructure level you have to have

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,960
tools you have to have a platform you

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:12,849
have you have the execution platform

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,750
that makes it all work top to bottom so

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:18,700
that's ok where do Q our product is

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,710
first your query studio which is based

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,139
on the clips and allows to visually

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,499
design refine right and develop

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,939
every single service and and an

00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,979
execution platform let's see okay we're

00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:32,680
runtime which allows to diplow execute

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:36,039
manager a single service which works

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,979
thanks to a rocky and Java a wiki which

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:42,460
will be presented in next talk my eyes

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:46,259
go to the right good luck John a few

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:51,659
facts about what you where we are now at

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:54,550
meal point in the duration of this

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:57,009
public transport project and its

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,129
ambition is to lower cloud computing

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:03,099
adoption costs by breaking up barrier

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,229
between various cloud implementations

00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:08,139
cloud layers and sell domains and

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:11,289
especially in a few fields which are

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:15,779
data center obviously infrastructure

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:19,419
deployment big data and link that also

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,069
thanks to aki obviously but also the

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,699
power of formal languages and

00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:26,770
model-driven engineering so ambition

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,689
doesn't stop at infrastructure level it

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,839
doesn't stop at platform level it

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:34,689
doesn't stop at analytics big data level

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,759
neither even the clink data that's you

00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,629
are going to define why it's going to

00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,039
end it's a cloud consumer platform cloud

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,960
provider place from there a lot of them

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:48,219
this one is for you it's a cloud

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,740
consumer platform yeah we have a

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,509
meteorologist extensible that means that

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,490
not only the molest and similar tooling

00:07:52,509 --> 00:08:00,759
is sensible and you can design your own

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:03,279
studio along and near the Dockers to do

00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,949
I think a sexual level rub accounts to

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:10,960
do a past level and obviously the meter

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:13,899
or kiss to you so our use case is about

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,259
monitoring energy consumption not only

00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,740
per user well for consumer as you can

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:25,960
find all your own energy billing each

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,729
month but also per CD / country because

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,490
we are trying to find out energy leaks

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:34,500
in the world climate changes picture

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,680
that means having a military point of

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,349
view Milty point of view / data that's

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,320
linked data because that's the answer

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:47,160
for such an open-world approach that it

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,250
requires we use what's called us we

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,240
don't tell a car that's a component that

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:57,240
provides a rest api for linked data that

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,000
it's both web friendly by being a JSON

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,490
and also Semantic Web compatible by

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,990
being json-ld thanks w3c for a standard

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,890
we have developer with this playground

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,220
which is we also have a swagger

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:18,810
playground obviously that's weather is a

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,450
little too technical you know swagger is

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,750
for developers and at some point if

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,670
offers technical developers become

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,480
business developers and need to be able

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:35,820
to wear when I don't know like an SQL

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,680
client a rep you sure that's what this

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:43,279
is a functional peg round to help you

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:46,440
debugging queries it a try to drop so

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:51,899
how are we going to help get some help

00:09:46,440 --> 00:10:01,140
from okay we're very easy here is the

00:09:51,899 --> 00:10:08,149
design we have our leader or hear all

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:12,920
this is yen and we have a few /

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:18,209
configuration place without the plans

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:22,410
which are filling in the netiquette

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:26,670
option down from sensor at our home

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:29,670
school and hitting a snack

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,070
and bring them to beacon light and

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,070
getting information both I'm getting

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,650
attention for a unit of sugar or a

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:45,890
whatsit and here actually really between

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,890
verification being very efficient means

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:55,290
being able to disable with us pneus it

00:10:51,450 --> 00:11:07,620
will be too costly and 12 great stuff

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:10,350
means because otherwise when what

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,110
happens is that you have an ahem /

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,530
performance of the main data

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,500
collaboration use of or linked data core

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,090
so we have here to tap on the Mongol

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,520
secondary and that's called

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:27,360
configuration you know we not only need

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,120
to provide infrastructure these local

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,190
containers we also have to provide the

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,880
software over it to chera software and

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,740
we have to configure it so that here we

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,320
don't have robustness and here it

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,140
doesn't generate not the primary as to

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,350
the regular use case and here we have

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,100
some other stuff like governance I was

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:57,870
talking about multi-tenancy before hands

00:11:49,100 --> 00:12:02,310
I'll print emo so here is the link data

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:05,400
extension you can see that everything

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:10,860
inherits from entity and is either a

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:13,470
link or resource I didn't lie and we

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,510
have all been a specific domain which is

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:22,350
linked data project which manages

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:24,300
configuration perder assets and Link

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,200
database link which will allow us to

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,200
specify a given infrastructure mode for

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,840
project to tapping you can have also

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,110
other views such a DSL which says

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,660
exactly the same stuff you can see here

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,640
we have an attribute which is a

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,850
whether we have robustness or not in

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,320
this project we have in action publish

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:53,640
on publish those are governor's actions

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,430
we can have checking model checking for

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,960
Mexican regenerate runtime exhibition

00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,790
platform configuration do a lot of stuff

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,150
I don't have the time to show you all

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:06,120
that but here is the tooling to visual

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,690
tooling first at infrastructure level

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,850
he'll have a local virtual machine here

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,920
we have a remote virtual machine

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,160
provided by other YouTube thanks to

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,770
dolly to an OpenStack and we have got a

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,240
container in yet okay a lot of people

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:26,460
allowed to visually configure docker

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,900
containers but this one is even more

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:33,420
interesting because it allows you to

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:37,050
really started it allows you to

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:40,170
configure also the other layers and the

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,600
other layers here means configuring

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,270
various projects about geographical

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,150
elements about organizations and prizes

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:56,210
companies and to specify that we have a

00:13:50,150 --> 00:14:00,480
different view / data that is analytics

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:04,460
specialized and that allows us to

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,080
specify using an led-based link which

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,920
infrastructure node we are gonna tap

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,530
data from and here it's also the DECA

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:19,790
that up with removal tool which is here

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:24,420
and I can vary stuff for instance I can

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:27,000
exist start publish and publish or

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,430
associate it's it's not published I can

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,790
publish it it's going to be published

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:38,700
here and if i go here in the playground

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:42,300
it should be published so here it was

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,880
not published nothing was frozen and now

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,400
here it is frozen everything is frozen

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,089
so it's published nobody can change it

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:57,180
anymore it's available for four

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:59,639
use so here we are you can see Oh Jim

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,120
managed at once every layer in the crowd

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,190
which allows in our case not to hamper

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,100
the main use case of data collaboration

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,139
performance when aggregating energy

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,510
consumption and saving the world from

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,389
Tammy change results are shown here

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,790
aberration by consumers aeration by city

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:21,959
other cities other countries territories

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:25,380
thanks sparking between and spring with

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:30,000
microservices what's up coming web stuff

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,459
more more MORE I enjoy you to get a look

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,250
at the function playground not of the

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:39,000
derrick orbit of okie and I think you're

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:42,899
going to have maybe a an insight when

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,620
Jean will be demoing the Iraqi runtime

00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:49,130
just up to me thank you very much for

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,130
