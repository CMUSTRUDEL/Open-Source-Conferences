the new start of descriptive startup

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,509
like Airbnb uber and so on the

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,790
descriptives large companies and it is

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,180
with all the technology that is arriving

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,500
and it impacts transport tourism any any

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,110
business what is the digital and if you

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,579
want to summarize what is a digital

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,720
experience but God want to speak about

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,799
the apps actually now people are used I

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,390
get used to use any device they want to

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,850
access their data from everywhere

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,070
especially what they want it's a

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,420
personalized and omni-channel experience

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,880
with their apps so they want it could be

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,270
the same apps from the connected TV from

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,660
the smartphone from any device from

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,860
mobile and so on it's not you

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:16,250
what digital means digital means

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,020
paperless so it's new Mary's SEO it has

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,320
been many years that we speak about that

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,510
with the materialization connected

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,870
device we have more and more connected

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,960
devices specially with IOT every every

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,110
object will send information and will

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,350
consume information and of course apps

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,290
we have data from everywhere but we have

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,360
to read this data or to produce this

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,510
data and how we do it with apps by apps

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,470
we don't mean only mobile apps or web

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:54,950
apps for us and apps it's some national

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,560
today it could be one side web

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,780
application but of course could be

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,660
mobile application and any device from

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,180
smart for asthma smartwatch and so on so

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,820
an application what they must have today

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,459
to build an application it should work

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,490
on desktop browser mobile browser on

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,800
smartphone on desktop native desktop TV

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:23,120
apps wearables and so on and we'll have

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,090
more and more screen devices the other

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,270
must have is the adaptive user

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,870
experience whatever the device you use

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:36,080
we want to have a user experience with

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,600
personalized and dedicated to the screen

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,239
that we use so it's very important to

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,160
have the reactivity the screen adapt

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,800
elite adaptability and the

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,760
personalization and the third one and

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,709
justice is what's important is the data

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,040
now we can't imagine to build an app and

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,650
apps that is standalone it should have

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,360
takes data from everywhere other from

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,690
the legacy system and the enterprise

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,540
from the cloud apps and we add from all

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,690
the connected object IOT that will bring

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,780
data from everywhere so with the market

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,200
today to develop an apps it should have

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,200
you did we have to take constant

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,959
consideration this three must have from

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,569
for the

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,139
apps and of course technically speaking

00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:28,560
if you want to create these apps depends

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,020
on the device the channel how we consume

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,020
the data we find a lot a lot of

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,930
framework we speak about angular iOS

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,560
Android every platform has its ecosystem

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,080
we need skills we here we need people to

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,240
adapt to maintain and so on and this is

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,419
a cost and takes time for the enterprise

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,229
so what the market needs today for the

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:57,630
apps is to accelerate and try to have

00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:01,020
the artists technology as accommodation

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,810
to develop apps so here what Wakanda

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,460
what is what kind of and from where we

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:12,120
come so what kinda comes from 4d group

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:15,570
for d it was founded by Laurent via via

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,110
the French gig developer of the 80s and

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,280
he developed the first database on Mac

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,340
in 83 and 40 today has been wounded 30

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,780
years it's works well it's as community

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,030
and it's now as I started and a 4g

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,460
starting a DB than several application

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,810
and now it's a full flat form a rad

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:43,639
platform but proprietary platform and

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:47,190
Laura in 2012 he had the idea is to to

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,710
capitalize on the database so we come

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,440
from the data database world and adapted

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,240
to the open source world so this it was

00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,389
the one of Wakanda project at 4d 4g

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:06,000
group in 2012 so it's an open source

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:08,729
platform it's inside we have the

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,680
built-in 4d database and then we added

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:15,300
JavaScript layer in a back-end and

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,419
front-end and a full full stack blocks

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,460
on JavaScript platform open source so

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,430
what's interesting in the topic of this

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,510
conference we live the two topics from

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:30,419
code to product that's why what kinda

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,420
was created as a company in last year to

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,880
build

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,520
a product with this open source project

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,180
and we live the transformation from

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,610
proprietary software layer to open

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,070
source software layer it's a huge

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,590
challenge it takes time and our

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,580
challenge as a walk and a start-up is

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,640
too how do this transformation it takes

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,320
time and just and at the same time the

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,540
market is going fast the technology is

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,630
going faster we have to improve what we

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,030
have already at the same time transform

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,450
from proprietary platform to open source

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:11,200
platform so what is what can the open

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:14,890
source platform our goal and our value

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:19,930
is to boost and accelerate the apps

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:24,390
development once again apps we mean web

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:27,820
apps mobile apps and device apps

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:31,660
concretely we have a full stack platform

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:34,960
we have our developed studio dedicated

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:38,140
for apps development I will detail the

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,050
features and we have a server a full

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,650
server JavaScript server it can be

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:50,050
deployed locally we support mac linux

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:56,970
and windows and we have of course cloud

00:07:50,050 --> 00:08:00,310
version of the server so what kinda is a

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:04,450
we call the product what digital art

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,330
factory so it's a full platform for

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,910
enterprise and specially also for the

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,580
tech startups because we believe now the

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,330
more and more apps will have on the

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,790
market they will have cross market apps

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:22,660
they all the new ideas is a growth

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,080
process they will have to do to mix all

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,630
the data from different domain today I

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,880
Bambi it's in the transport market maybe

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,790
tomorrow they will add a UT information

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,800
in the apps to manage the homes so the

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:40,120
apps will extend and will have cross

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,250
market and of course even for each

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,529
market for each enterprise we have a

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,209
difference

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,560
apps we have different data and

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:52,319
different business apps so not only we

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,720
have to consider to have a platform that

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:58,819
aggregate different market but also

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,800
different apps and technology and what's

00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:04,199
what we think and we believe that the

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,220
main value of this platform is how we

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:10,199
use this data and others it's it became

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,559
already all the other layer front end

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:15,899
and the the ID and so on it's a

00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,389
commodity but how we use and how we

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,879
consume and how we manage of these data

00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:26,790
that will come from everywhere and this

00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:29,249
is our value as wauconda server and what

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,949
we see on the market of mobile at the

00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:35,309
same way what happened on the website at

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:39,480
the beginning of the website we had PHP

00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:43,589
my my sequel DBS and so on then arrived

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,910
the package the package stack lamp wamp

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:49,290
and so on and then the CMS drupal

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,779
wordpress and then the plugin and

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,930
templates and now to build a website

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,889
it's very very quick and boost it and

00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,259
what we see on the app's the same wave

00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:05,639
five years ago we spoke about android

00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,879
angular android/ios PHP JavaScript a lot

00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,769
of framing then the full stack started

00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,990
to come like the mean that were you and

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:15,870
then we have the mobile application

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,319
development platform and now we arrived

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,300
a level of commodity to add connectors

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:25,889
and what will start to speak about apps

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,230
templating and work under its on the

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:31,410
full stack we started as a walk on the

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,319
framework five years ago we packaged in

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,480
a full stack and now we are in the step

00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:40,920
to accelerate and add connection and a

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,290
public completing so if we take the

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,660
whole lifecycle of an app development we

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,480
have of course in designing with a

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,360
designer the initiation of the project

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,129
development and test deployment and then

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,570
publish it and all the stores and all

00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,890
the way

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,870
to have these apps so what kinda doesn't

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,140
cover the design step that is a

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,200
publishing but we in the project step

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,690
the initiation prep step development and

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,570
deployment and for each step we believe

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,960
if we we provide all the tools that we

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,260
need and every step we accelerate the

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,970
whole apps development process so for

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,910
the initiation we we have a platform

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,040
ready and one click you install it and

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,070
it is ready you have everything you need

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,880
to start and develop we have that we

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,920
start to add the Abscam plating by

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,900
market and the project complete

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,110
populating we support more and more

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,540
framework angular 1 angular 2 Yannick

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,610
one Yannick too soon react and so on and

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,730
it depends on what framework you want to

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,400
use its scaffold automatically to start

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,860
quickly your project then the

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,580
development and testing step we have a

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:59,560
full workflow dedicated for mobile

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:03,470
building testing deployment we have very

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,200
powerful features as a data abstraction

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,960
layer and the server whatever the data

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,230
source it could be a relational database

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,350
my sequel you configure the connector

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:18,860
automatically you have a JavaScript

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,510
object layer that you can manipulate we

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,790
would provide more am a connector for

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,790
cloud application soil force and so on

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,130
and the idea is that the developer can

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,800
use the built-in database so our own

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,770
database or third-party database or

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,230
cloud application are from any IOT the

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:40,040
developer will use the same way he can

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,920
aggregate data extended he manages

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,500
security data / data he can he can

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,890
decide which data goes to the front or

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,550
which that day in the back end and of

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:55,400
course all the data is generated

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,380
automatically to the front end so we

00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,310
provide the built-in database for people

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,140
who want to create very quickly powerful

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,600
and very powerful because all the layers

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,759
are optimized optimized

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,519
and we provide more and more ready to

00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,250
use connectors we are working for

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:18,440
example to support us AP and a for

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:20,449
example very soon testing all the stock

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,730
is deployed on the desktop of the

00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:25,759
developer we can test everything and

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,639
offline very important the offline part

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,889
we support mac and windows so we can

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,709
choose you can install it deployed

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:37,339
tested we support also can develop as a

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,430
team and then we can choose the cloud

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:43,100
version and in one click he deployed the

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,220
application as it is online and then it

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,660
goes and publish it if it is a mobile

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,990
apps he go and publishes in the

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,560
different stores so to have a view of

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:58,819
the architecture so in the south of the

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,610
data sources then all the data arrive

00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:06,110
and data abstraction layer all the

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:09,819
layers are in JavaScript we provide a

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:14,269
visual data modeler so he can model eyes

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:16,939
all his objects all his data or his

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,740
JavaScript object for example if you

00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,209
have them I sequel to be automatically

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:25,040
he see it he sees it in his modeler and

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:29,420
then he developed his logic in business

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,259
logic security automatically API and we

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,649
developed connectors for the front-end

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:38,600
framework we supported a angular 1

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:43,069
yesterday we released the support of

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:46,819
angular 2 yannick 1 and 2 to generate

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:48,920
mobile apps hybrid mobile apps and for

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,800
people who want to develop in native

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:59,600
apps who will provide SDK to develop on

00:14:51,800 --> 00:15:02,839
iOS and any dedicated platform so to

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,319
summarize why work and the boost the dev

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:09,319
dev apps so it's a full package full

00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:12,500
stack package platform dev tools we

00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:14,360
provided all the tools to be able to

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,000
enable the developer to focus on his

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,420
business features ready to use business

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,139
connectors

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,560
when we add value to the all the apps

00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:28,620
framework and the more we develop on

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,839
this platform the more we can wreak and

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,940
reuse all the business models that he

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,380
will develop in the back end so for the

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,079
enterprise the more they will develop

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,510
will provide a catalog of models you can

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,339
share with all department and so it

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:44,130
accelerate all the life cycle of

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,769
business apps and we launched a partner

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,040
program two months ago we have more and

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:52,560
more partners to help people startups or

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,600
a business unit today they have an idea

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,240
of project with our partner we go they

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,529
develop on our framework our platform

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,709
and we provide the old projects thank

00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,709
