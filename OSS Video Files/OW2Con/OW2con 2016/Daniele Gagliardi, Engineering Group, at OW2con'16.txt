hi I'm Daniella Galiardi from

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,270
engineering group i'm from italy and

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,900
high-end chairman of the technology

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,779
council since last spring and it is a

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:30,630
very interesting and strong experience

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:33,110
because i have the opportunity to learn

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,760
this is the very important thing for me

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,770
my experience in technology council

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,370
started two years ago almost and I

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:49,649
started to see how the community it's

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,050
the central point within the the w2

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,410
world and also the collaboration with

00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,420
the phone or a and Before we jump off a

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:03,899
yawn was very very fruitful they they

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,350
gave me a lot I would like to to bring

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,790
my experience and have an ox an Oscar

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,790
program at amateur level with the

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,790
widespread

00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:21,439
adoption within the WT projects I would

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:29,600
like to see more competition within lw2

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:33,619
and my dream is to c 0 w as as a giant

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,570
in the open source the the first indie

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:40,250
maybe the only reference within europe

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,299
we are passionate passionate about

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,090
technology but sometimes passion it's

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,130
not enough it's important to have a

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:54,830
business model it's important to

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:58,940
industrialize experiences patient it can

00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:02,509
be of obviously a fuel for the for the

00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,789
innovation and for the open source

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,619
business models yes I involved in

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:10,910
technology in Flast infrastructure I

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:15,200
participated through several discussions

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:19,040
on it and the cross fertilization works

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,470
because in engineering group we adopted

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,620
github after Noah did in in the

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:31,070
technology council meetings I work

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,970
mainly in the field of the of the

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:38,690
quality processes standards and so on

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,870
and within the Oscar program this can

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,930
can be a benefit because a

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,560
trated these these topics for several

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,739
years I teach several courses about test

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,360
processes and quality and so I think

00:02:51,739 --> 00:03:00,620
that my experience can benefit leow to

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,079
nap another key point to me is the cross

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,459
fertilization between the CIA I

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:09,500
experience and the Oscar program and I

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:14,090
think a lot of opportunity and

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:17,349
potentials arising from what I heard

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,150
during this this conference yes the

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:22,459
speech about the open source cool this

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,019
was a very interesting thing very

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,760
interesting because I think it is a

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,760
