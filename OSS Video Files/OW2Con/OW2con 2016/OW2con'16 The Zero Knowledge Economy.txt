Title: OW2con'16 The Zero Knowledge Economy
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	You've probably heard the phrase "If a Service is Free, You Are the Product".

While there are exceptions, it's definitely the norm when it comes to web services.
Our interactions with online portals expose a wealth of personal information.
When such services become compromised, the exposure of that information can have far reaching consequences for their users.
The damage to a company's reputation is often irreversable, and at the very least such events put marketing departments on the defensive.

Yet, few who are in a position to attract attention have been immune to attacks. Well-intentioned employees get manipulated, and customer details get exposed.
With each high profile data leak, it becomes more apparent that the only way to keep private information secret is to ensure that it remains inaccessible even to yourself.

At XWiki we've been developing systems which use cryptography and distributed computing to offer real time collaboration systems which keep the server oblivious of the contents of a session's contents.
Zero Knowledge systems protect not just your customers, but your reputation.

This talk will focus on how an organization can use such systems, and keep its information safe, even from itself.

	00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:15,240
okay so this talk is about financial

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,410
incentives in computing it's not really

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,550
about a particular technology but a

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,279
whole bunch of things so yeah social

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,210
media is everywhere you've probably

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:34,110
noticed and individual people can reach

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,910
a very wide audience and little mistakes

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,370
blow out of proportion really quickly so

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,420
if you slip up then everybody hears

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,480
about it so today I heard about on

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,879
twitter about lenovo making a deal with

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,219
microsoft to not allow people to install

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,579
linux on lenovo machines and i run a

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,289
lenovo machine and i can step up in

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,910
front of you and and tell everyone that

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,510
I'm not going to buy another lenovo

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,950
machine because because of that so this

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,220
is going out on the internet and

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,640
everybody's going to hear about that and

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:19,979
that just kind of proves my point that

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:24,270
yeah word travels quickly so yeah as as

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:29,159
I've said I'm Aaron McSween I manses on

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:33,750
github and on key base and I work on the

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,310
real time editing technology collab

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,720
collaborative real time editing

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,520
technology at X wiki and yeah so before

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,770
I talk about the zero knowledge economy

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,119
i'm going to talk about the old economy

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:52,579
so this is not really the exciting part

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,890
but it gives us some context yeah you

00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:59,369
you know this is the economy that

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,439
everybody who was alive before I don't

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,280
know your two thousand was pretty used

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,380
to businesses make products they sell

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,370
them people buy them

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,050
maybe if you go back further than most

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,080
things were provided locally this is

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,060
sort of pre globalization and a lot of

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,960
things are sold for cash if you're on

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,240
the international market so for example

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:30,640
coca-cola you don't use your credit card

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,860
to buy a can of coke so you know a lot

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,230
of things are distributed all over the

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,500
place it's paper records people have

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,670
paper receipts and it's not easy to

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,770
analyze this is what was called a people

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,990
meter there's a technical name for it

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,160
but it would have this on top of your

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:54,040
television set and you didn't have to

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,180
have it but company would talk you into

00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,610
installing it in your house and before

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,360
you go to sit down and watch a TV show

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,820
you hit a button saying that a family

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,810
member number one is watching TV and it

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,820
analyzes what you're doing and so yeah

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,100
here's a quote being a Nielsen household

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,350
brought with it some nice perks he

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,300
actually paid us we got a check several

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,040
times a year for fifty dollars and it's

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,660
not a lot of money but every bit of

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,090
every little bit helps so analytics used

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,760
to be pretty expensive and it was hard

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,400
you wouldn't get a lot of information

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:38,980
from one of these boxes because it's

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,480
only for one family and yeah that

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,480
doesn't really represent a lot of your

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,520
market you miss a lot of data and

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,459
there's not really a lot you can do

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,350
about that because not everybody is

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,350
going to install this in their house and

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,970
even if they did you wouldn't be able to

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,430
deal with all of that information so as

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,820
somebody participating in this economy

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,220
data is really expensive it's biased

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,640
because you only get users who choose to

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,890
install this in their house only

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,340
metadata can be analyzed they don't get

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,470
to hear you talking in your living room

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,609
about what you think of the television

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:24,580
show they just see that you're watching

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,379
and even if they had more information

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,500
data science was really primitive so you

00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:33,819
don't people didn't really know what to

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,009
do with all that stuff so I guess what

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,750
we learned from that was that consumer

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,460
relations are tangible you go into a

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,639
store and you buy something and you know

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,110
the shop owner if they do something that

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,560
you don't like you can just stop buying

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:51,370
and that makes boycotts fairly effective

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,279
and users or consumers had a fair bit of

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:58,060
power even though it was it was

00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:03,279
difficult to organize well yeah that

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,900
that wasn't actually true so that that

00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:10,060
was the impression that people had but

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:14,139
in reality yeah people couldn't really

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,560
work together and that's why we saw the

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:20,319
rise of big corporations that you know

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,110
coca-cola and know that I grew into the

00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,759
corporations that we see today so over

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,909
time the economy changed into something

00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,889
else this wasn't really clearly defined

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:36,460
some companies picked up on it earlier

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:40,479
some picked up on it later but we ended

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,750
up in a new economy and yeah the results

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,479
are hilarious or depressing depending on

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,110
your perspective and here we are in the

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,509
data economy and so we see that data is

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,560
everywhere the rise of the Internet

00:05:52,509 --> 00:06:00,759
means you go online and every single

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,770
thing that you do leaves a trace it's

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:07,569
really hard to have privacy because you

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:11,919
can encrypt some things but you can

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:15,219
infer a lot from from side channels and

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,860
if if your business operating in this

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,469
economy you can maybe sell once to your

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:26,409
users and then sell again to marketers

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:28,659
and a double dip but it's more likely

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,440
that you don't sell you your users you

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:38,400
sell your users so you may have heard

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:42,030
the phrase how does it go if you're not

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,500
paying then you are the product users

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,840
don't have a lot of options in this

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,220
space because myspace died out because

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,990
people weren't using it facebook is

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,630
everywhere twitter is everywhere and

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,450
people go where the most users are so

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,720
there's a big big network effect that

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,230
you see and a lot of the users don't

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,240
know that you're selling their data so

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,640
maybe your grandmother's on facebook she

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,310
doesn't know about metadata probably I

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,050
don't know your grandmother but maybe

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,220
she doesn't know maybe she doesn't care

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:20,010
and she just goes on posting and it's

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,770
fine so cory doctorow calls this

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,880
surveillance capitalism it's this idea

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,910
of watch everything and sell everything

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,820
and it all has a price but how much is

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,610
your data worth it's not very much

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:40,919
actually so marketers figured this out

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:44,100
that they're buying in bulk and this

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,470
information isn't super informative a

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,390
lot of the time most of us we have this

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,130
thing called banner blindness when if

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,650
you see something that looks like an ad

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,320
you automatically ignore it and this is

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,270
used as evidence why your website

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,910
shouldn't have carousels because it just

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,500
looks like an ad and people like

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,470
actually can't see it there's all these

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,090
tests where they do I tracking and you

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,419
look at the screen and it just jumps

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,890
right over the carousel but yeah if you

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,550
if you're pregnant in your second

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:18,300
trimester then your value goes way way

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,300
up because they can sell more to you if

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,890
you have a specific health condition or

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,250
if you're pregnant and you have a health

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:30,090
condition then that's even more and you

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:33,719
see if your credit card is stolen that's

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,330
actually not worth that much two

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,200
thousand dollar credit card goes for

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,390
less than two hundred dollars so yeah

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,010
things that used to have a lot more

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,310
value don't anymore because they're

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,480
plentiful

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:54,770
so for example here's Ashley Madison and

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,940
this company they're from not far from

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,730
where I am I'm from in Canada I'm from

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,490
Toronto and they're from Ottawa and they

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,130
figured out that you can make a dating

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,550
website for people who want to have an

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,100
affair and you can make a lot of money

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,470
off that because these people are trying

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,450
to keep secrets and if you're trying to

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,920
keep secrets then you'll pay for it so

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,870
you sign up for this site and if you

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,580
decide after a while that you don't like

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,640
it then you pay to delete your data well

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,640
actually they have this slogan it only

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,850
takes a moment but it only takes a

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,649
moment to leak your data and basically

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:46,490
lulz ensue if ya if you use that

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:49,730
vernacular so yeah as I said they offer

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,200
a full delete option and for nineteen

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,970
dollars you can fully delete your

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,290
account information and actually this

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,410
function was never really written it

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,450
just like modified some data it erased a

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,790
few things but most of the information

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:10,160
was left over so yeah lots of public

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,120
publicly are sorry personally

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,230
identifying information and when their

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,330
database got hacked which most people

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,680
presume was from an insider because

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,920
that's the easiest way to leak

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,709
information their database goes online

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:34,310
and you can just search over it and yeah

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:36,680
lulz so yeah they what they did was they

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,690
use BOTS to simulate women which

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,440
attracts male users here's the stat 31

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:48,410
million mail accounts in the database

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,810
5.5 million female accounts most of them

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,290
were BOTS

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:57,760
and most of them were never actually

00:10:53,290 --> 00:11:00,610
active so you lure people in and then

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,330
you take their money and say you're

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,790
going to delete their information here's

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,680
the plan say you're going to delete

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,800
their information don't actually do it

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,300
get hacked and leak everything and then

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,770
just keep going they're still in

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,830
business today you can check out their

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:22,330
website ashleymadison.com no remorse but

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,520
yeah people keep buying I guess they

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,160
don't follow the the news about things

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,160
getting hacked so there we go nailed it

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:37,540
next funny thing pregnancy tracking apps

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,670
like I said if you are pregnant your

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,660
information is worth a lot more because

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:47,470
you just have to by and by and by and so

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,480
people make these apps pregnancy

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,640
tracking apps that make sure everything

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,990
is going well and you make an app for

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,990
people and they don't think about the

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,930
security they just pick up their phone

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,610
and they enter in any details that you

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,160
ask them because they don't assume that

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,530
it's going over a network but so people

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,400
put in all the details of their

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,980
menstruation cycle their personal wait

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,710
what medications are taking cervical

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,339
mucus appearance history of abortions

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:21,820
diarrhea low sex drive mood all of that

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:25,960
and there's basically no thought

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,330
whatsoever of security because you know

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,339
you can sell this anyway and people will

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,740
buy and if they're going to buy it

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,920
anyway why would you even think about

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,160
security so yeah this was the globe

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,530
pregnancy app as i understand it most of

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,390
these problems are fixed now so i don't

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,770
want to get sued i'll tell you that it's

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:54,279
better now but at the time of a review

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,110
it was found that accounts were linked

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,760
without permission so let's say you want

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,600
to share some of this data with your

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,070
husband you send them an invite and they

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,030
can reply to it and then

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:09,280
instantly they have access to everything

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:13,240
without you actually confirming it so

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,250
there was a not a lot of control we're

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,000
talking in the last presentation about

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:23,130
granularity and our two presentations

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,020
ago access control there was none

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,740
personal data was in forum so like

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:33,760
Facebook you can go and talk about

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,580
whatever pregnant women talk about with

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,630
each other you can do this on a forum

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:43,510
and yeah they don't tell you this but

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,180
it's all out in the open anyone can look

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:50,080
at it there's sort of a suggestion that

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,540
is private but it's not and then there

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,390
were a few more things where they could

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,730
iterate over all the user accounts

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,520
because they were numbered sequentially

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,520
and there was a bug where you could just

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,220
log in and change passwords so you get

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,890
complete access to their entire database

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,610
with not too much work and it's all very

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,560
sensitive so this is from a blog I don't

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,480
know if it was about the globe app but

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,360
it's related there's a couple apps in

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,120
this space that have a similar data data

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,340
model of business model but yeah seven

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,560
months after my miscarriage mere weeks

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,050
before my due date I came home from work

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,910
to find a package on my welcome mat it

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,980
was a box of baby formula bearing the

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,390
note we may all do it differently but

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,800
the joy of parenthood is something we

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:45,840
all share so this woman realized that

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,220
even though she wasn't pregnant anymore

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,040
because she had installed this app and

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,390
used it she was now on marketing lists

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,850
and they didn't go and notify the

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,960
marketers after she had deleted the app

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:06,400
but yes she keeps on getting targeted

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:10,000
marketing about her baby sending formula

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,360
and diapers and all sorts of things like

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,549
that just to remind her of the

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,410
experience she'd had so

00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:22,459
yeah this was a few more quotes from

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,809
that article although i've logged my

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,099
miscarriage into the app and stopped

00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,249
using it that change in status

00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:29,859
apparently wasn't passed along so

00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:34,099
there's a lot of money to be made off of

00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:36,889
all this data and not a lot of thought

00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:40,789
or etiquette going into how we're using

00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:43,909
it so on that note here's the Internet

00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:45,889
of Things which has come up quite a bit

00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,949
a lot of people are really excited about

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:53,419
it and it's a it's a hard market to get

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:57,169
into so margins start at two percent

00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:59,689
there's intense competition among people

00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:01,159
who are making similar products and

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:02,689
everyone wants to offer the thing with

00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,139
the lowest price because if you can get

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:09,559
something for twenty-five dollars or 24

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:13,069
or 24 50 sorry euros I guess I'm still

00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,539
thinking like a Canadian you're gonna

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,419
buy the one that's cheaper most of the

00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:21,109
time so what they do is they lock people

00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:23,929
into buying and then like I said earlier

00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:25,819
double dip and try to sell them a

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,709
product once and then sell their

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:31,999
information that's where you make more

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:34,519
money so we have the advent of sex toys

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,159
on the internet where you control

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,709
everything with your smartphone and what

00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,629
could go wrong right and here's another

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:44,569
thing everyone was talking about REST

00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:48,169
API so that's how you control things and

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:51,399
goes over the Internet and again not a

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:55,879
lot of thought as to security this was

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:59,299
talked about at Def Con that some people

00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:03,079
did a little bit of an audit and found

00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:06,829
out a lot of details of a bad practices

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:09,470
from this company and yeah so the device

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,079
shares temperature data and intensity

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,899
settings in real time and that goes

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:20,779
right back to the company for market

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:24,169
research I will call it and yeah so at

00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,980
this Def Con presentation one of the

00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,990
researchers follower

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,600
said we want to question that assumption

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,570
and say you know if you're making

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,130
intimate devices and that are controlled

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,630
by mobile apps maybe you should consider

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,760
whether you should be collecting that

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,770
information in the first place if the

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,900
information isn't collected then it's

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,080
not vulnerable to either security or

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,799
data releases and legal enforcement so

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,470
this is something ludovic from xwiki

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,950
talked about a little that not not on

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,390
the topic of sex toys but about

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,690
collecting information that you can

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:04,380
collect information use it to improve a

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:08,460
product and you should do that with the

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,220
consent of your customers and do

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:15,210
something to help them and then there's

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,370
information about ah I don't things that

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,150
sometimes the company just has no

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:23,370
business knowing so yeah there's a

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,520
lawsuit going on over this and the suit

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,100
yeah as it says without explain to

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,490
customers the toy collects data on date

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:37,530
use settings and emails and transmits it

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,040
and yet it's come up lots of people have

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:44,730
said it cory doctorow again any data you

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,940
collect will leak any data you retain

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,650
will definitely leak and if the NSA

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,750
can't stop with secrets from leaking

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,660
what chance to standard innovation sense

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,870
sorry that's not correct road i was uh i

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,850
think follower again from defcon but

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:06,510
cory doctorow has said similar things

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:08,940
but yeah the on the internet people see

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,230
these headlines on slashdot and a lot of

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,750
people are saying well that's just how

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,900
it works you can't just connect to

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,750
devices over the Internet well you can

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:22,350
with new technology but it's all very

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,880
experimental but yeah they say you need

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,640
some server to act as an intermediary

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,179
and servers just naturally collect

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,970
metadata that's that's what they do

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:35,640
everybody turns on logs because if you

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,419
get hacked then vlogs are the only way

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,989
you're going to figure out what happened

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:44,450
they say it's it's not that big a deal

00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:47,509
but yeah that's not how it works the web

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,369
is improved WebRTC lets people talk

00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:54,830
directly to each other with just a

00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:56,749
little bit of a handshake and you you

00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:00,440
can create metadata but most of what you

00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:03,649
send will be encrypted but it can be

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,659
encrypted and yeah this is important

00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,639
because there are various places in the

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:09,109
world where this sort of stuff is

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,619
illegal and if you send it over the

00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:16,909
internet people can go to jail so i

00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:19,309
guess as companies like we have to think

00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:23,840
about these things so this was one of

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:25,609
the people on slashdot that says it it

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,220
has to share that information if it's

00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:30,980
going to be remotely controlled and then

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,960
there's more products that I'm not going

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,999
to go into all the details but you can

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,249
understand why why I find these things

00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:42,499
strange that we're putting things on the

00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:46,249
internet that I don't know why they need

00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:50,989
to be there nanny cams going over the

00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:53,989
internet and yeah so Quinn Norton wrote

00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:56,899
an article and talked about named this

00:20:53,989 --> 00:21:00,109
law that over time all data approaches

00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:03,289
deleted or publix so if data is

00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:06,019
encrypted and people can't make sense of

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:08,179
it than they might just delete that more

00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,730
likely they'll hold onto until sometime

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,460
when they're able to crack that

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,989
encrypted information but if it's

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,419
unencrypted then it's going to be public

00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:20,509
even sooner because everybody gets

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:23,659
compromised sooner or later and so that

00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:27,289
brings us to what I call the zero

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:32,899
knowledge economy it's sort of a

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:36,590
response to the data economy and the

00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:40,159
idea is that we came from this history

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,749
of when you did something then not

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,359
everybody knew about it a lot of things

00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:48,559
were ephemeral and would simply go away

00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:51,200
right after you did them but now

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,750
everything has a record and so

00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:02,460
the zero knowledge is economy is a way

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:05,100
of selling to people the idea that when

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:10,200
they trust their data to you nobody has

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:13,560
access to it and yeah if if you don't

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,330
implement policies like this then users

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,820
just have to believe you when you say

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:21,120
that you've deleted information like

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:25,860
Ashley Madison but service operators

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:29,970
abused trust and yeah when things are

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,920
sensitive that your best option is to

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,720
just prevent the operator from ever

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:40,800
having access to that data that can be

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:44,880
in the form of just keeping everything

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:50,010
local or there's alternatives so this is

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,050
the zero knowledge economy yeah you

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,500
provide a service to clients with a

00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,630
guarantee of confidentiality so in some

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,830
cases you can do that with cryptography

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,630
instead of empty promises you can keep

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,400
the cryptography open source because

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,980
that's really the only way that

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,900
cryptography makes sense and maybe you

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,050
can come up with some software as a

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,170
service model for paying users where you

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:19,230
offer something else like hosting that's

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:24,330
a pretty common model SpiderOak for

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:29,850
example is a out of time okay I'll try

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:34,290
to make this quick so yeah you can do

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:36,600
things locally you can keep it from

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,390
going over the network and here's some

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,400
examples encrypt is a paceman service

00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,060
that uses client-side cryptography to

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,670
keep all the information that you post

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,610
secret from the server it has no idea

00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,880
what you posted and the encryption keys

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,280
are stored in the hash of the URL so

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,700
that's how you sure it up one is

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,960
encrypted file uploading crib pad this

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,169
is what I work on

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,600
almost every day and that's real-time

00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:10,480
collaborative editing without the server

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,840
having any idea what you're working on

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,049
so that slash user who said this is just

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,970
how it works and servers have to know

00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:23,380
what you're doing the truth is they

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:25,950
don't and yeah the Internet's been built

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,760
on this idea that everything has to

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,299
middlemen have to know what you're doing

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:36,399
and yeah this is a pretty untapped

00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:38,200
market nobody is doing this so when you

00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,520
respect the users privacy you earn their

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,070
loyalty and it's fashionable because

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,309
there's all of these applications Google

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,289
Facebook and several others are trying

00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:55,770
to get in on the end-to-end encrypted

00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:55,770
