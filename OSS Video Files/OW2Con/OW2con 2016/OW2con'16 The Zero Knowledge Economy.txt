Description: 
	You've probably heard the phrase "If a Service is Free, You Are the Product".

While there are exceptions, it's definitely the norm when it comes to web services.
Our interactions with online portals expose a wealth of personal information.
When such services become compromised, the exposure of that information can have far reaching consequences for their users.
The damage to a company's reputation is often irreversable, and at the very least such events put marketing departments on the defensive.

Yet, few who are in a position to attract attention have been immune to attacks. Well-intentioned employees get manipulated, and customer details get exposed.
With each high profile data leak, it becomes more apparent that the only way to keep private information secret is to ensure that it remains inaccessible even to yourself.

At XWiki we've been developing systems which use cryptography and distributed computing to offer real time collaboration systems which keep the server oblivious of the contents of a session's contents.
Zero Knowledge systems protect not just your customers, but your reputation.

This talk will focus on how an organization can use such systems, and keep its information safe, even from itself.
