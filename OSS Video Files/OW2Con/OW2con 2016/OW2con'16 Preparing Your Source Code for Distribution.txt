Description: 
	When I was a young engineer, I grew listening to an old software engineer that said too often: "You don't know, what you don't know".As years passed, that strange motto started to make more sense for software development. We send zip files or gits with the code of our products to other people in a professional context, too often without really knowing what kind of third-party code and licenses are inside. In this session we go through simple techniques to clearly list the third-party libraries, code snippets and marking your own software as yours in a standardized manner. So that the next time you share code professionally, it is easy for others to understand the applicable licenses and copyrights within.
