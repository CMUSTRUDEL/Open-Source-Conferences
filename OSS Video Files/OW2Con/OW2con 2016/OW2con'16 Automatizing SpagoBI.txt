Title: OW2con'16 Automatizing SpagoBI
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Installing and deploying an application can be messy and may result in time lost, unexpected results and, finally, discarding the application itself. A valid solution for this could be providing different automitizing techniques, and publish the application on the most popular marketplaces of cloud services providers at the same time. In this spech I will present the experience we gained and the route for future enhancements for the SpagoBI suite in order to make its adoption easier and increase its visibility, exploting well known automation tools (Docker, Chef, Juju) and cloud facilities.
