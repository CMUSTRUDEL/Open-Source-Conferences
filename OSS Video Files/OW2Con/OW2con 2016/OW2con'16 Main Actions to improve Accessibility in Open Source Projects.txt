Title: OW2con'16 Main Actions to improve Accessibility in Open Source Projects
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	Open source accessibility technologies can serve people inclusion. They can generate new links between employees, partners or individuals with visual or hearing impairments. But traditional projects are managed from a technical angle, trying to deal with a form of disability or another. This is a frequent error, as organisational challenges have to be addressed in the first place. Let's check some tangible actions and methodologies that could be used in the ongoing OSAi open source accessible projects.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:15,179
good morning so I'm Arnie Alton yet and

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,029
i discovered web accessibility when i

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,449
had health problems and i tried to use

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,660
the internet and one day I couldn't use

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:29,369
my right hand and I didn't understand

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:32,430
why it didn't work so i just checked the

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,590
code but i wasn't a coder at the time i

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,410
was studying Chinese so that's

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,570
completely different and I just

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,610
discovered some website works and other

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,780
don't and that's a really big problem

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:55,800
for for people when they have disability

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:59,010
for permanent time so since 2007 I work

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,140
on the accessibility digital

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,580
accessibility not only web that's now we

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,060
should talk about digital and what I

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,250
discovered is we always focus on

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,110
technical problems but web accessibility

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,040
and digital accessibility is not a

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,759
technical problem for real so we're

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,680
going to see that accessibility should

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,090
be considered as a process in your

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,189
organization and the keep issue in the

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,650
organization how do you take the

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,259
accessibility into account in your

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,560
organization and the problem is often

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,310
human not technical then we will see the

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,820
slightest difference between complains

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,020
and accessibility and how its importance

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:54,960
and why and I try to give you some tips

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,030
about how to take accessibility concrete

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,899
lean into account in your organization

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,630
based on United Nation definition of

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,160
reasonable accommodation so

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,349
accessibility as a process we can talk

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,250
about accessibility as a process like in

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:17,760
the iso nine

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:23,380
one a quality method it's a standard

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,950
that explain everything in your company

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:31,180
or organization it works in a foundation

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,990
to our nonprofits should be considered

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,260
as a process it's not a step we whistle

00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,800
with the previous speaker that it's not

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:48,810
in one point in the project but it's all

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:51,690
along the process and at the beginning

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,739
everybody wanted to outsource

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,840
accessibility so we just discovered in

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,090
our company we had problem we want to

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,070
have a logo or something that say we're

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,739
good in accessibility so we pay experts

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,830
and we have a perfect website for

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:16,000
example our profit product free software

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,910
and then maybe in two weeks it's not

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,820
accessible anymore why because they

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,820
outsource the question of accessibility

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,799
and the accessibility can't be

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,200
outsourced you want we really want to

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:34,180
take it into account for the long long

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,070
run so the key problem is who is

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,060
accountable for accessible in the

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,670
organization so you have to appoint an

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,070
accessibility manager any organization

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,329
of several if you have you have a big

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,100
company and its in the racy and you

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,829
should know the the press of the racy

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,040
you have the responsible the the person

00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:00,459
who is doing the job but and you have

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,829
it's often a different person the person

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:10,780
who is accountable for this job and let

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:15,180
the mean problem i can give you an

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,620
example i worked in my previous company

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,760
for the government french government's

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,760
and we make

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:30,289
a charter to make a level it's a logo

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:34,870
accessible to make it accessible and one

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:39,469
of the key points you have to to respect

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:42,229
is to have a letter from the manager we

00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:44,870
say we're involved to make it accessible

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,960
and that's the most complicated to

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,270
obtain so they want to pay to make it

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,729
accessible to make audits but they don't

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,129
want to in to be involved in the process

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:59,590
and that's really something if you don't

00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:02,840
have in source the problem you can't

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:06,580
have accessibility in the long run for

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,930
your products and it's a big issue in

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,190
open source and free software community

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,250
because we always says if it's doesn't

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,460
fit your needs you just have to focus so

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:23,150
that's that's a good way of telling

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,789
people it's not my problem so and I work

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,360
a lot with Chris of their communities

00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:31,550
and that's a big problem that just say

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,659
that's not my problem it's free you just

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,729
have to work it and make it accessible

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,949
it's impossible to make the world

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:41,740
accessible you have to you're

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:46,009
responsible of what you're predicting

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,680
corporately are you have three steps in

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:53,150
the accessibility process the first is

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,550
to make a diagnosis agnostic to know if

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,949
you are accessible on that because

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,039
sometime when they say is it accessible

00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,469
some people answer yes or no that they

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,020
have no idea for real so you have to

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:08,930
check it seriously and to make an edit

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:12,440
and to see if you're compliant or not

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,259
with that usually we use the

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,479
international standard its wake up web

00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,440
content accessible and owns that you can

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:24,110
use for free software to then you have

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,599
to repair the problem is what do you

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,260
report but everything is read everything

00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:33,530
you have a lot of non-compliance point

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,470
where do you start but you have to make

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,720
reparation and then because you probably

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,160
didn't River everything you have to

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,290
improve so it's continuing continuing

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,530
enhancement because digital

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,750
accessibility is a never-ending process

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:55,380
it's a process of course the major

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:59,010
importance of non regression testing for

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,950
accessibility I won't say it enough

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,040
because sometimes we have big projects I

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,840
can save Firefox talk about Firefox and

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,460
some time it's really good and you have

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,130
a new version and it doesn't work

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,040
anywhere anymore for for some people and

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:18,780
we just ask why because they didn't have

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,610
checked this new functionality for

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,110
example and doesn't work anymore it's a

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,600
really big problem and it's a big

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,090
responsibility and it's really hard I

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,880
know it's hard because it's a

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,470
never-ending process I don't know if you

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:37,520
in the room you know about exerciser

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:41,040
some are you know go out but some

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,550
exerciser is one of the tool that can

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,670
help free software developers to test to

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:51,840
check if it's accessible or not for

00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,670
software not for web and what's the

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,350
difference between compliance and

00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,000
accessibility when we read the web

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,030
content accessibility guidelines and

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,710
only expo do because it's rare it's if

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,190
you want to have headaches you can try

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:11,490
but it's not recommended the working

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,350
definition is accessibility protein

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,300
means it's supported by user assistive

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,250
technology as well at the excessively

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,650
feature in browsers and other user

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,630
agents it means you don't have to build

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:28,370
an assistive technology you just have to

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,490
make it work with the technology the

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,810
user with disability use that's really

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,070
important because it's not that

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:41,640
complicated sometimes I see the rubber

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,920
by try to add specific functionality

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,790
it's not the good way to do it you can

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,400
just

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:52,800
think about the 3d glasses it's the same

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,570
if you have pretty glasses to watch a

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,800
movie and the movie isn't compatible

00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:01,920
with the glasses it doesn't work so some

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,750
people have assistive technologies but

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,640
your concerns doesn't isn't it the

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:15,420
accessibility is not supported but by

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:19,020
your content you have four major four

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,060
main principle in accessibility your

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,010
content have to be perceivable we say

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,150
poor miserable operable understandable

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:34,080
and robust the first one is really

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:36,240
important it's one of them for principle

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,420
of accessibility defined by the way card

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,600
and it means you code as to respect

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:48,950
standards accessibility non-compliance

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,190
is should be considered as a blog that's

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:56,340
very easy to understand it means you

00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:00,300
have a notion in the copd it's the

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:05,610
convention really relative and person

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,510
with disabilities a bag for one person

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,160
must be considered at work for everyone

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,490
the cook is not the question how many

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,650
user use it you don't know if people

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,580
with this empty doesn't you don't use

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:23,850
your product because it's not accessible

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,370
or because because it's not accessible

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,340
or if it's accessible maybe you would

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:34,470
have more people people who would use

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:38,100
your product now the product

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,460
and a dub user view point you have to

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,640
identify showstoppers what is the more

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,090
most important in your product because

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,090
you can say just a critter accessibility

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:55,710
criterion is more important than ever it

00:10:51,090 --> 00:11:00,180
really depends on the context so you

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:03,210
have compliance with a standard like

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,760
guidelines like wake up and you have

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,430
accessibility accessibility means people

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,400
can use your product and sometimes you

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,880
can have an average of complaint that

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,860
not perfect but it's usable and sometime

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,990
you can have a good average of

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,830
compliance and it's not usable it really

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,560
depends on the context and you can't

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:31,940
just think about it with complaints in

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,380
mind you have to keep users in mind and

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:41,160
for that we can just see that the

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,650
question is inclusion we often talk

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,010
about accessibility accessibility is the

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:50,960
technical part of inclusion inclusion is

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:53,850
most important it's a human right and

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,320
when we see the definition of the

00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:01,670
convention people with disabilities of

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,570
the United Nation they define

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,900
discrimination and the basis of

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,380
disability increase denial of reasonable

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,180
accommodation so you have a

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,420
responsibility you're accountable of

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,750
what your product on what is reasonable

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,000
accommodation reasonable icon with

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,000
accommodation means necessary and

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,850
appropriate modification adjustments not

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,820
imposing a disproportionate or undue

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,580
burden we are needed in a particular

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,550
case to ensure to persons with

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,820
disabilities the enjoyment or exercise

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:42,030
on an equal basis with others so it's

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,840
important if you consider a feature is

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:48,150
not that important you don't have to put

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,920
it on your site or your soft

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,730
if it's important for some people it's

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,380
brutal for everybody of all human rights

00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:04,890
and fundamental freedoms so we have to

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:08,730
access to make realization you can

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:12,690
prioritize with the user impact is it

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:17,970
necessary and appropriate and the costs

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:20,640
come to you don't have to impose this

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,570
proposition 8 or undue burden so it

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,130
means in the legal term it doesn't mean

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,170
you have to be a hundred person

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,960
complaints you have to make it

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:35,100
accessible to the most people and they

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:38,000
have to be able to use your products so

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,250
we can define for priority fields in

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,300
digital accessibility depends on user

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:49,110
impact and co and coast the first one is

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,930
when you have user impact is really high

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,480
and the coast is really low of course

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,820
you have to start with that it the first

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,180
priority so it's quite easy to

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,000
understand the first priority is easy to

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:08,150
understand too it's really expensive and

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,100
it's not really useful so in this case

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:14,130
you just have to think is it really

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,190
useful this functionality this feature

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,990
if it's not useful for some people

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,570
sometimes it is sometimes you have some

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,710
features that are already visual and

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:29,880
give some feelings for the user but

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:32,100
people with visual impairments won't

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,350
benefit for it so maybe it's not really

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,570
useful for some user and useful for

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,470
others and really expensive to make it

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:44,460
accessible so you can have to you can

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:48,210
think about it and then I think the

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,270
first case and the last case are going

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,450
to have a consensus then you have to

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,579
prioritize between the 203 and it can be

00:14:54,450 --> 00:15:01,369
more bringing more discussion

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:05,209
I think in second time you have to go to

00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:11,329
to make reparation in the non-compliance

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:13,999
when it's very easy to correct even if

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:21,889
the user impact is not the most

00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:23,929
important because it'd make a good image

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,720
to developer in good mood they can just

00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:30,410
close a lot of issues and it's really

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,470
important for them and it makes the code

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,720
cleaner so you have the fourth principle

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,079
robust so it contribute to make the

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:44,029
Coney more robust and the last one is

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:48,429
the free the priority three the priority

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:51,790
of three it's a case when you can

00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:55,910
delegate to the universal design

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:59,540
principle it means you can just decide

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,790
to not correct to read not repair the

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,110
non-compliance but you have to give an

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:09,499
alternative we can cite the Wikipedia

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:14,629
example when you want to create an

00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:18,049
account on Wikipedia you have a link and

00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:21,860
you fulfill inform and then you have a

00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:25,279
capture but if you're not able to risk

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,519
to solve this CAPTCHA you can jenn send

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,799
an email and they help you that's an

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,579
opportunity that works because you're

00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:37,790
able to create your your your account

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:40,939
and that's really not compliant but

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:44,319
that's in accessible and that really

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:49,600
inclusion so you have a range of

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:52,910
solution possibilities so in conclusion

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,619
you have two three key points in source

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,230
digital accessibility as one of your

00:16:54,619 --> 00:17:00,439
organization process you can outsource

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:03,739
it it doesn't work in the long run check

00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:09,210
small check often and never stop it has

00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:11,530
to be in your process to include the

00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,780
accessibility audits really know

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,050
precisely where these complaints or not

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,110
and in identify the core functionality

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:23,110
of your products on the user site make

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,640
them work for all so add up just using

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:30,570
site not only it works because its

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:35,950
standard but it does it work for you

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:38,620
user so it's just the last word it's

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:43,680
okay if should try and fail but it's not

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,680
