Title: OW2con'16 Open Source School, the First Software Engineering School Dedicated to Open Source
Publication date: 2016-09-28
Playlist: OW2con 2016
Description: 
	In France alone, the IT industry is short of 40,000 engineers with appropriate open source skills, and over 3,000 are missing each year in the only field of open source.
This is one of the reasons why Smile decided to create a school entirely dedicated to the teaching of open source : Open Source School.
This unique school in France is divided into three mail activities :

    First degree courses ((from Bac+3 to Bac+5)
    In-service training
    Occupational retraining

Come and learn about the Open Source School.

	00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,290
well hello everybody good afternoon so

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,599
I'm going to present to the open source

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,300
school I'm just going to present myself

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,660
before in a few words so I'm Jennifer

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,869
chalet I join smiled a few years ago ten

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,199
years now and as a heads of emulsion

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,750
communications and two years ago I

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,660
stopped this job and it's my took in

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,649
charge or the training activity and this

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:42,050
was under the brand smile training and

00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:46,020
so working on this training activity we

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,780
we built a project named open source

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,090
school and this was we started working

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,219
on this project about a year and a half

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,949
ago and I'm very pleased as they prepare

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,510
to present the projects now which is it

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:03,539
for it has begun so first them why such

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,810
a school I'm sure you know everything

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,140
about the open source market you know

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,729
that it's very active for more than ten

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,549
percent a year strong growth and

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,950
practically hundred percent of

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,470
organizations use open source in devotee

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,500
we've got thousands of open source

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:30,530
professionals it's a very active market

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,360
yet we have a recruitment paradox

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,060
basically every year we've got fifteen

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,659
thousand new jobs created in the ITU

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:43,049
markets and 15,000 young graduates

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,810
coming out each year but a practically

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,509
ninety percent of the IT managers say

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,270
they have trouble finding and recruiting

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,009
opus or skills and this is not going to

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,680
get better because more than half more

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,850
than fifty percent of recruitment

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,880
managers plan to hire more open source

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,750
skills in the next few days so we're

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,789
really here in the paradox and real

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,829
problem of

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:19,280
having the goods and adequate training

00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:22,579
to meet the needs of the market and this

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,790
is why we decided to to create such a

00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:28,879
school and such training center so to do

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,209
this smile propose to the school or ab c

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:37,670
which is an IT engineer ii school to

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:40,250
lead this project together we started

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,799
working on the project a year and a half

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,560
ago we presented it to the Prime

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:50,599
Minister services of France because we

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,750
decided to to try and be labelled eyes

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,359
as a Vista small Daphne program this is

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,439
a program where the government through

00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:04,700
the commissioner-general a novice is not

00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:09,079
led by which words f chooses some

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,120
projects in the French economy to lab

00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,150
allows them recognize them as a versus

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,030
maldives Nia and we have worked hard and

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:21,109
we have been approved in this project

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:25,069
and supported really indication of the

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:27,919
open-source cool and not just supported

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:31,220
and encouraged but we also had a big

00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,909
rotation of 1.4 million euros to launch

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:41,120
the school and gravity hopefully

00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:44,690
continued existence this school is not

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,459
smile schools it's not out just yes not

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,569
just smiles we really want this hood to

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:55,040
be open to the ecosystem and very early

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:57,879
in the project we we talked to well

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,459
different people whom we work with them

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,340
regularly and propose them to join the

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,069
project and they were all very pleased

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,329
than eager with with it and audible

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:13,759
YouTube obviously with part of it and

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:17,120
this is important because it's really

00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:20,180
one of the DNA of the school to be open

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,010
to everybody and while all the people

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,760
making or doing open source should

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,780
should join us

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:34,380
and of course we are also supported by

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:37,560
the CNN we so we we had the approval in

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,140
September last year and of the

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,800
government of the state and we began the

00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,830
communication campaign in February we

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,890
had the loads of news cats in the

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,730
prayers we did events we did videos we

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:58,670
really worked to the to the band

00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:03,810
awareness of the of the school we have

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:07,050
schools and education centers in quite a

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,670
few places in France we actually use

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:16,980
smiles and FC infrastructure to give the

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:19,770
courses and open the classes what I'm

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,050
specifically gone them presents you now

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,470
is the three main activities of the

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,560
school the first one regarding higher

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,020
education for the students the second

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,680
one executive education that's all the

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,930
training we're gonna do for people in

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,310
their professional life and the third

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:44,670
activity is sharing all the resources we

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:50,700
can create and gather in the open source

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:54,510
code so higher education that's of

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,810
course for the students students who are

00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,210
admitted in the school after a back to

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,210
do so two years after their back LOL

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:07,410
this is equivalent of a levels in

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:10,080
England so at the open source school

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,140
they can come with us for three years in

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:18,810
a sandwich course so sandwich courses on

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,630
enterprise skool skool enterprise and so

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,890
they can really learn all the theory and

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:29,340
then being apprenticeship in a in an

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,950
organization the scholarship is free for

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,180
students or took in charge by text upon

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,789
cessation

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,520
and of course at the end of the three

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:43,259
years though they practically all have a

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:46,560
badminton job this is just a slug to

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,009
remind you how diploma organized in

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,639
France and to show you how serious the

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,190
school is and the diploma we deliver at

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,410
the end of the year for poss Regents so

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,830
you've got all the University diploma

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,460
first so we're not in this in this

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,680
specific range this is all the diplomas

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,639
delivered by university then you've got

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,080
the engineer schools the high schools

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,810
how you call them in front comes a

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,160
corner and then you have all the schools

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,900
delivering titles a handsy handsy before

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,169
French speaking people people is in

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,630
France is a better nation LD that you

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:32,039
get from fortis vennela so this is where

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:34,220
OSS open source cool is so Trojans if

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,380
they stay one year with us they have the

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,720
title level two and if they stay all the

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,870
three years they have a title level

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,000
three a level one sorry and this is

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,260
equivalent to back precinct so it's a

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,150
real diploma recognized by the state and

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,590
this is one of the first questions we

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,070
had when we presented the school to

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,440
students is is my diploma really

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,120
recognizes it avail school or real

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,320
training for me so this is very

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,020
important yes it is the education

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,840
program is fully open source it's not

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,909
just an another antes for we open in

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,259
it's really open source school so they

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:20,639
have a customized program with a

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,949
be all sorts of open source tools and

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,789
technologies are teach our talk there

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:29,009
and they also have a special cross

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,750
called active member and that's when

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,770
we're going to ask students to

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:39,029
participate to or contribute to an open

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:42,180
source project so it could be going have

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:45,120
come here 20 delivered or and help maybe

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,710
for the organization or maybe do a new

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,320
website for the

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,950
for the association or maybe contribute

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,910
to beauty program we really want the

00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:01,940
students to during all the scholarship

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:05,700
with us really get this community

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,300
behavior and develop their network and

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,420
go to events and meetups and this is

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:16,020
very important in them in their class

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:19,200
with us the other point is that we

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,390
really wanted this the the school the

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,540
higher education program we really

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,280
wanted it practical as I said at the

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,660
beginning of the presentation it really

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:34,170
had to meet the needs of the market

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,890
people coming in class to do the

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,230
teaching they're all professionals and

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:43,470
and this is something that's really

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,990
really appreciated by the students they

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,190
like knowing how things are the

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:52,500
enterprises and and really being with

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,810
people who sometimes are not that much

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,460
older than them but who really have this

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:02,070
real world experience of open source so

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,340
that's for the higher education activity

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:09,270
I don't know if you have questions so

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:14,130
I'm going to present you the executive

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:16,020
education activity so its center the the

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,490
baseline open source called executive

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,000
education this is all the trainings we

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,880
can deliver for people once there are no

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,780
students anymore but when then their

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:35,610
professional life so in the executive

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:38,160
education offer we first have the short

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,670
trainings over open source we can

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,900
propose so they're all available on the

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:49,690
to train on those specific technology

00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:52,540
individual trainings or intercompany

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,070
classes that's when we build we propose

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,399
a class and different people from

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:00,070
different enterprise cam the training

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,480
center is of course certified this is

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:08,230
important in France because French

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,959
companies have a specific budget for

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,270
trainings and being a certified training

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,850
center means that the trainings you will

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,450
be doing with us can be took in charge

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,730
by this specific budget with early or

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:27,399
busy up for those who are who know the

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:29,440
training system our instructors as for

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,920
the higher education programs they're

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,390
really an experienced instructors who

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,610
most of them have encountered the

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,980
difficulties or problems sometimes and

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,410
their projects and they really like you

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,579
to share this unique experience they can

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:55,000
have with them your people and following

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:57,910
the training with them another big

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,209
activity in this executive education and

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,480
I think that's the activity I'm really

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:07,540
fond of is all the crawfish Norfolk

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,350
invasion we are working with the pool

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,240
impromptu a program

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,670
that I called in English back to work

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,530
program but in French is played by

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,000
hastinapur has one elder hopeful Harlem

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:24,740
wat and these programs really dedicated

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,130
to unemployed people and the aim of this

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:32,090
program is really to train them to a

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:37,430
specific job really needed on the market

00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:41,510
and then to place them in in high wing

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,580
companies so this training of course is

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,700
free it's about three hundred and thirty

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,030
hours that's about three months

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:53,050
intensive training it's free for the

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:56,270
candidate of course and free for the

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,820
company who will hide the candidate at

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:02,360
the end and it's really a good program

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:06,430
because it's it's a program that takes

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,890
an unemployed people change them and and

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,110
has partnerships with enterprises so the

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:15,740
people who've been trained will enter

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:21,100
directly company afterwards we are

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:23,960
starting one in mid-october with three

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,710
company partners of the of the program

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,610
and it's one which will prepare the

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:32,270
candidates are the unemployed people

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:35,540
through the job of a developer PHP forum

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:40,040
PHP developer and we received about

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,140
three hundred letters from an employed

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,530
people is that oh I would like to try

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:50,030
this program and and most of the people

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:52,820
who are candidate today they're people

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,370
who have some time tonight any

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,280
experience and IT background or at least

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,840
a scientific background and who have not

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:05,900
been doing i.t as a job that we have the

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,420
basic skills maybe to run to learn this

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,400
job so it it's very very interesting

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,120
because it's really putting back to work

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:18,430
some people and at the end of the year I

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,380
should have a group of them entering new

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,059
companies so if these kinds of program

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,769
interests you don't hesitate

00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:30,169
tactus smile alt away as well we are

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:34,119
partners of the program will be hiring

00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:40,339
some of the people we are training to be

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:44,059
PHP developers the last part and then

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,099
I'll be done is serving our sources this

00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:51,049
is one of the engagements we took when

00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:53,869
we apply to be program at assessment a

00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:57,099
venir and this is one of the reasons why

00:15:53,869 --> 00:16:01,159
the government gave us also some

00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:04,429
financial and rotations is that we want

00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:07,459
to share a maximum of resources that

00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:11,599
would be produced within the open-source

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:13,339
school so first of all is the MOOCs I

00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:15,979
don't know if you are familiar with this

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,349
but basically your MOOC is a course of

00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:22,009
study made available over the internet

00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:26,169
without charge of a very large number of

00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:30,789
people says the Oxford Dictionary and

00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:35,359
basically it's trainings with on the

00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:39,109
vigil trainings leaning on the different

00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:42,469
teaching means quizzes forums hands-on

00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:46,699
and practicals and all these video

00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:52,249
trainings will be made available on the

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:54,559
on our website or platform and so there

00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:59,409
are not available for the moment we're

00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:01,969
working on them we hope to have maybe

00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:05,059
half a dozen of them by the end of the

00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:08,869
year the ones we're working on at the

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:13,249
moment is algorithmics and linux

00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:14,539
embedded and the other we are you plan

00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:17,029
to do by the end of the years also

00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:22,999
understanding open source and which have

00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:25,819
we have many topics and well when i'm

00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:28,669
looking forward to receive them all

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,919
finish it's a lot of work but i hope

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,369
people window will enjoy them afterwards

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,169
and finally the last badly resources

00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:37,040
would like to share why it is all the

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:40,880
training with you

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:44,990
and all the slides and crosses we will

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,280
learn we will make her well with the

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,180
open source schools and all the

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,990
different instructors which will be okay

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:57,110
to to share their their slides there are

00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,790
all uploaded for the moment on the slide

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:04,520
shower page and I think there must be 12

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:08,360
or 15 for the moments and we really plan

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:12,350
to publish all of them by the end of the

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,170
year and also well ordering them the

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,390
next month's so I think this is

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,060
something unique in France I don't know

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:25,000
if any other training centers of having

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:27,560
all this material and other schools so

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,360
man is really one of the engagements

00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:35,590
being open as much as possible okay

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,590
