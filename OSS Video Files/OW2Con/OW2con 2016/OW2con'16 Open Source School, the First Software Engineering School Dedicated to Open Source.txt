Description: 
	In France alone, the IT industry is short of 40,000 engineers with appropriate open source skills, and over 3,000 are missing each year in the only field of open source.
This is one of the reasons why Smile decided to create a school entirely dedicated to the teaching of open source : Open Source School.
This unique school in France is divided into three mail activities :

    First degree courses ((from Bac+3 to Bac+5)
    In-service training
    Occupational retraining

Come and learn about the Open Source School.
