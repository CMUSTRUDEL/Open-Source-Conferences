now it is time for questions is there

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,940
another microphone that people can use

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:16,129
to ask questions because I'm hard of

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,970
hearing now what I'd like to do is have

00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:23,769
one person hold the microphone there and

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,869
that people come and queue up to ask

00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:31,060
because passing the microphone takes a

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:39,610
long time each time and it's very boring

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:57,320
can someone bring a word share Thanks

00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:59,570
raise your hand if you have non-free

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,740
components such as an infirmary you have

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,100
a free and liberating system well there

00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,930
are two situations with firmware there's

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,929
firmers that's buried inside the

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,329
hardware somewhere if it's not intended

00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:16,789
for people to install different software

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,340
there you can treat it as part of the

00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:23,049
hardware in fact we may not be able to

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,700
tell whether it's firmware or not and

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,740
there's no sense giving great way to

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,590
something where we can't tell which way

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,270
it is even if we happen to know it could

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,509
be that in practice we couldn't have

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:45,380
told on the other hand there are any

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,829
firmware blobs that are found in the

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,979
vanilla version of Linux disguised as

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,459
source code so in the so called source

00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:58,579
code of Linux you'll find files with

00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,829
long lists of numbers and those each of

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:06,770
those lists is just a proprietary

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:08,390
program an executable is its proprietary

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,240
because the source code is not available

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,200
and typically it has an instance of non

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,980
free license people and that proprietary

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,250
software installed

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,450
as part of your system and we consider

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,430
it unacceptable

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:32,069
so our version of Linux is modified we

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:35,209
call it a linux Libre and we just delete

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,209
the non free pieces

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:42,450
well those firmware programs needed to

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,780
make certain pieces of hardware run we

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,870
can't run those hardware devices in the

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:55,129
free world so we have to not use them

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,129
and so we need more reverse engineering

00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,810
come up here if you want to ask a

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,930
question because that way the microphone

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,879
will be here for you I would wonder what

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,239
can people contact you if they want it

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,140
well that's my email address is RMS at

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,680
canoe gorg

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,069
but since most people's questions are

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,709
actually frequently answered questions

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:27,799
it's better to take a look at our FAQ

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:32,459
pages and send mails of canoe canoe org

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:37,139
and if if it needs me to answer it it

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:42,540
will get to me after some time thanks

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:45,780
again wonderful talk with you I don't

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,549
think I would be going on but could you

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,410
take some time to tell us about your

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,540
experience talking around the world and

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,160
what sort of response you are getting

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,780
from different people in varies but

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,200
notice any trends in how things are

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,130
going with the result I can't remember

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,879
unfortunately my memory

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:10,620
I've given probably around 1500 speeches

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,230
a rough estimate maybe it's only 1200

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,609
the point is I can't remember them

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:21,239
individual responses very you know I

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:24,120
have supporting supporters of free

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,639
software and sometimes there are people

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,259
who are against a Hawaii of change

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:37,710
to criticize and then their people in

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:41,159
between so that's a freedom to modify

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,229
our code imply an obligation by

00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:45,479
programmers to what write free software

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,699
to select the particular programming

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:53,009
language which makes the code easier to

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:55,620
modify it by marking no because I see

00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,680
those as qualitative differences and

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,289
people disagree about which languages

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,289
are better especially for which purposes

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:12,800
so I don't think we should treat that as

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:12,800
if it were criteria and ethical criteria

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,210
I'm curious what your recommendations

00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:27,180
are for remote management of computers

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,759
and management I've never done that so I

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,939
am the wrong person to ask guidelines

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,759
that you know well the guideline we

00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,680
would offer is the system that you're

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,310
managing should be free software and

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,319
imagine program should be free software

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,949
but since I've never done that kind of

00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,349
thing

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,349
I don't have something to recommend

00:05:52,339 --> 00:06:05,129
really means on the internet the

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,699
presence of comedians are cons week was

00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,500
really different from then until well

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,279
the main thing I'm going to say that's

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:21,020
different is that the proprietary world

00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:21,020
has become even more devoid of scruples

00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:27,330
without you without any apparent chain

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,810
they will do any nasty things of their

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,810
users

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:40,300
you know the other changes that 15 years

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,979
ago in practice there was nothing like

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,919
SAS

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:47,199
you didn't find people saying we'll make

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,319
this an instead of releasing this

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,930
program will provide a server where

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,639
people can do this thing and of course

00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:00,370
that can't ever be ethical if you can

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,710
comment on that on this earth of the

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,080
movement of international treaties we

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,009
had a great presentation earlier in this

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:24,490
conference about TPP oh yes and

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:28,229
specifically isn't engineering basically

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:32,159
in that one respect the TPP just

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:37,599
reinforces the unjust law known as the

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:45,310
Digital Millennium Copyright Act which

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:50,080
prohibits just distributing anything

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,460
that can break DRM and it also in some

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,099
cases prohibits

00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:00,009
the braiding of DRM but there are

00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:03,339
exceptions for that in any case the

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:07,960
reverse engineering that we need done

00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:13,990
usually doesn't involve DRM directly for

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:16,509
instance do of a network interfaces and

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,919
you want to figure out how to write a

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:23,370
driver for that or suppose there is a

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,949
GPU and you need to figure out how to

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:32,010
develop free firmware for that GPU most

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:34,899
of it has nothing to do with DRM and and

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:42,149
therefore the DMCA wouldn't come into it

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:43,820
now the TPP is absolutely hard is like

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,700
all

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,150
so-called free trade treaties its

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,730
purpose is to attack democracy it's not

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,360
really a trade treaty it's a corporate

00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:00,020
supremacy treaty it is designed in this

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,570
case ephemeral in the older so-called

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,830
free trade treaties the attack on

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,580
democracy was implicit for instance in

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,710
the World Trade Organization the main

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,200
thing was just that companies could

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:18,050
easily move production from one country

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,280
to another which means that they could

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:25,160
make comfort countries compete to do for

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,590
which one would do the least to protect

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,230
the environment and public health and

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:34,370
the treatment of workers and the general

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:37,940
standard of living and nominally this we

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:41,990
these governments can still do it but if

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:46,330
they do the businesses say will move and

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:50,000
so mostly the countries are ruled by

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,670
business flunkies from top artists who

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,750
will foul down businesses who do

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,300
whatever they order and they can cite

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:03,470
the World Trade Organization as making

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:06,080
it unthinkable to do otherwise of course

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,250
we need to elect people who'll say damn

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,580
in the World Trade Organization and

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:17,960
let's let's crack it

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:20,510
let's fracture it let's destroy it let's

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:28,070
shake it so hard and it starts cracking

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:33,470
apart but the TPP which stands for

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:37,100
treacherous food of rat poison has an

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,090
explicit attack on democracy any foreign

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,180
company that believes it makes less

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:51,500
money as a result of some law or policy

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:55,430
can sue in some bogus international

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,560
tribunal which is set up basically to

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:02,600
give businesses what they want

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,999
and they the government pay for whatever

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,129
it costs that company to protect the

00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:10,160
environment or Public Health or

00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:14,839
treatment of workers or the standard of

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:19,180
living so if the u.s. signs it we've got

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:23,029
a campaign to pull out of it

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:33,559
we must stop taking each defeat as

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:36,259
forever by the way there's a proposal

00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:41,259
I'd like to mention to you which you can

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:45,220
find it carbon whi port proposing a

00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:49,399
carbon tax for the state of Washington

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:55,100
now a carbon tax is the effective way to

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:57,800
make businesses emit less the proposal

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,420
is revenue neutral meaning the money is

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,279
given back to people by things like

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:09,860
welfare or cutting the sales tax or

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:13,550
cutting income tax for people so if we

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:18,379
don't put pressure on everybody to emit

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:22,329
less carbon burn less fossil fuel but it

00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,329
will help the poor cope with things

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,540
you

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,080
they try so I work here in a very large

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,350
company and they thrive off of his

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,930
prettiest software every day and they

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,360
the legal department is currently as a

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,050
stands that we're not able to interview

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,720
part changes back the free software

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,430
evening this is something that you

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,620
didn't know when I'd be possible I would

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,910
really like to change I was just

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,650
wondering if you had any advice for

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,600
someone might be going up against the

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:12,560
very large spelling and trying to make a

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,360
positive impact or change well I would

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,820
say the person who would have the best

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,820
suggestions about that is Evan Mullen

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,730
but it can't hurt to find an you know

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,030
maybe the company's lawyers could talk

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:32,600
to him he can show them that they are

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,940
saving because many of many large

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,780
companies have in fact we did their

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:50,360
chances I mean we've got changes from

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:53,510
companies as prestigious as IBM so this

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,980
company's lawyers are almost certainly

00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,980
mistaken in their reasons

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,089
hi Richard you Brittany trestle amount

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,610
of code in your lifetime this question

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,930
is more psychological so if you don't

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,009
mind can I ask you to open up yourself

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:18,709
as a a memory you have like a powerful

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:20,869
memory when the last time you wrote

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:26,889
Pacifico that you felt sort of lost from

00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:29,329
the process I don't want to go there

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,920
well I wouldn't feel that way in the

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:36,290
process of writing it but in the process

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:40,009
of debugging yeah it's the kind of thing

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,869
that could make me tear my ear so you

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:44,119
don't want to talk about writing

00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:46,610
software regular stuff I don't

00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:49,009
want to talk about the painful feeling

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,110
of you know when I would think I'd found

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,569
a bus and I would change the code and

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,490
the book would still happen and that

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,410
would happen several times in your row

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,369
it could get any to the point of

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:15,759
screaming was horrible yeah it's a

00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:17,139
definitely don't go back to this was on

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,779
itsc

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:27,050
incompatible time-sharing systems back

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:32,449
in the late 70s or early eighties the

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:34,759
system crash and I had some job I didn't

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:39,259
want to lose so instead of rebooting I

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:43,879
loved it and I found that a certain bit

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:48,439
in a certain word was wrong so I fixed

00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:51,139
it and continued it and then I found all

00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:54,139
the places in the system that news that

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:57,110
bit as a flare and check how they got

00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,649
the addressed change it in and I found

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:05,509
one that was wrong where the address

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,619
would have been possibly random and so I

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:10,119
fixed that code

00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:10,119
I think I fixed that

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:20,679
but that would have been impossible to

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:23,259
track down by usual debugging it's okay

00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:29,439
one short question of do you have any

00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:33,220
advice to two other programmers about

00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,869
bloody of white bring us off blast

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,209
why keep writing software do you think

00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,639
from the empty brass up there

00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:44,379
well I don't when I stop writing

00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:47,079
software of more than 20 years ago I'm a

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:49,689
free software activist I was

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:55,749
involuntarily self promoted into

00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:58,720
management and so being the president

00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,939
the FSF and chief nuisance of the new

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:08,049
project and the leader of the free

00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:11,169
software movement is planet but I enjoy

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:13,209
writing code because I was good at it

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:16,419
and I produce good things that people

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:19,120
like to use and then when I started

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:23,649
working on to do I was not only doing

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:28,960
those doing that I was also advancing a

00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:31,870
fight for freedom now I still advanced

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,720
that fight for freedom but not by

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:39,639
writing code but in general when you're

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:47,409
really good at something it feels good

00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:51,490
to do it for under $3 you brought up a

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:53,399
lot of the inherent issues with sass and

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,500
how it's not a little through software

00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:58,690
do you think I don't say that and which

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,750
it actually is compatible with free

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,470
software sometimes the software on the

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,139
server is free sometimes even has been

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,960
developed by that server operator and

00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:14,559
release this free software but that

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,690
doesn't make sass okay you see with free

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,029
software you can change your copies and

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,750
I can change my copies and the server

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:21,380
operator

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,110
contains his guidance

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,090
but you can't change his comments so

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,789
what his copies are doing your computing

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,580
you don't control that computer so my

00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,470
question to you is do you foresee there

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,010
being any logical advancements in the

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,669
future and could make sacs and resolve

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:43,970
SAS acceptable by the Christoffel

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:45,590
philosophy no because it's an inherent

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,020
problem now

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:53,900
we must distinguish SAS from renting a

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,150
remote server if you rent a remote

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,500
server the or virtual it doesn't matter

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,600
and you decide what software to run that

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,380
then you'll control that computing so

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,049
that's ok although for a remote server

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,330
of course there is the possibility it

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:17,120
will be accessed by somebody like the

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:20,000
hosting company or Big Brother so for

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,919
some things some data shouldn't be there

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,870
unless it secretly but for many purposes

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:32,270
that is is an issue so yeah

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:37,100
the remote server could be useful what

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:40,490
about the GPL the this is the middle of

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,210
Pharaoh GPL which is a modified version

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:47,510
of the regular GNU GPL with one

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:51,710
additional requirement it says that when

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:54,470
somebody which has a copy running on a

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:59,390
server it makes that server accessible

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:02,000
to others it's required to let those

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:06,140
others download the source code of that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,890
version now this does not address the

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:12,440
issue of size nothing can fix at this

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,510
address is a different situation but

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,530
server that's doing some other kind of

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:23,539
thing and so it's not sized and so it's

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:25,400
basically in principle ok but people

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,620
might make improve versions of your

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,440
program and run them and never

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:34,700
so you'd never get the changes and you

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:39,470
couldn't put them into your version well

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:41,690
the authority pls says that it republic

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,309
can access that server the public has to

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,200
be able to download the source of that

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,210
version so you could download that

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,419
source and it would come under the

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,330
affero GPL if not he's copywriting

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,130
forgery so and then you've got those

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:07,460
changes you can put them into your

00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:10,100
version thank you very much could you

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,409
pronounce your consonants more carefully

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,570
I don't have any trouble hearing that I

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:17,210
would like to talk about reverse

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,510
engineering education especially for

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:23,779
Native children the most interesting

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,940
math class I ever took or ever gave was

00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:28,700
to give the children these wonderful

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,289
worksheets of hundreds of problems every

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,470
day we had to do it this is like

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,809
proprietary teaching software and what I

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,179
did was I said okay you guys reverse

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,669
engineer this you tell me what they're

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,740
trying to teach you on this stage and if

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:45,980
you can figure it out you can tell me

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:49,070
which problems I want you to know I will

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,799
release you the best for them right and

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:58,039
that way now every single kid in that

00:21:51,799 --> 00:22:00,620
second grade class yes very different

00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,200
science those guys are so into the food

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,320
and don't think of learning and rigorous

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,970
engineering how to learn it then it was

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,510
just amazing and I just put that

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,080
together

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,710
I think your speech thank you that's

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,049
interesting

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:21,580
of course the next step is get them to

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:24,520
write a replacement program because all

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,870
educational works should be free

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,149
basically

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,429
people ask me sometimes how far the idea

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:35,899
of free software clinics and other kinds

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:37,880
of things a program what's what's

00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:40,140
crucial about a program is that it's

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,200
those work designed to be

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,570
used to do a practical job and if you

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,020
can teach your children that concept

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:55,080
they don't work they will learn people

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:58,170
do this are you still a teacher on there

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,720
tell her that I have connection well

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,330
would you be interested in helping to

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,930
organize the school free software

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:13,110
movement because we need people to help

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:17,510
organize it basically at this point it

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,510
exists in the minds of some people but

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:33,510
could you send me a message to be free

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:36,150
are the words that are designed to do

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:40,050
practical job with and the include

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:43,440
programs recipes for cooking educational

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:47,340
works reference works for formatting

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,340
paragraphs of text 3d printer patterns

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,800
for useful objects that it will be used

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,600
to do practical jobs and there's some

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,190
other things maybe we'll think of some

00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:05,310
more the point is these works should all

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:09,600
be three gets wrong if they're not so we

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:12,480
need to get working on free textbooks to

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,540
replace the non free textbooks that are

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:23,430
being pushed on many students often with

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:26,130
DRM this might be a silly or trivial

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,070
question that's just hereness your

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:33,830
choice for the four to three aspect

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:38,370
ratio of your peers I use this computer

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:41,640
because it's free all the way down to

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:45,540
the BIOS and I don't you know I would

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,960
have accepted it with any aspect ratio

00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,590
of the screen I don't like getting my

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,590
aspect

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:07,120
and it's been said that modern laptop

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,120
screens are length wise and with foolish

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:17,260
but mean for me that's a secondary

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,260
question

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:36,940
dr. Selvidge my recent convert to free

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:43,360
software euro black black recent recent

00:25:36,940 --> 00:26:25,419
member position counterparts okay I

00:25:43,360 --> 00:26:36,370
would like to know if you okay so I'm

00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:39,220
going to go back to carbons did you're a

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,990
new stop and software at and there's a

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,330
whole bunch of making drugs more

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:48,840
expensive as a big win so what what

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,789
would you do they give an idea having

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,470
Cartman and you talk about carbon taxes

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,740
about Harbin terrorists

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,840
so that each country would pay based on

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,159
some important account apart with you

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:06,610
been putting mister did convince people

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,429
do that he would give up I mean I know

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,590
give up is kind of a strong word but the

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:21,970
DRM and the software back and all the

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:25,389
stuff is essentially what he was

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:28,200
developed to please business right it

00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:30,669
was developed by it in a method that

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,279
assured it would give businesses what

00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:36,669
they wanted businesses were allowed to

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,630
participate in the drafting while the

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:45,050
public was not

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:48,620
so basically there's no reason to

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:51,970
propose putting these nasty things into

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,290
a treaty to get an agreement on

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,260
decarbonisation no no I think the nasty

00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,660
things hours to get agreement on fun

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,390
because the u.s. is the one that's with

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,670
is is proposing these nasty things right

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,860
so we would say oh we won't propose

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:11,120
these nasty things if there's a

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,790
government error and I play this WTF I

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,390
have no idea whether there's any

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:20,210
basically it's just a question about

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:24,490
what might be feasible with the given

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:27,710
with positions of various governments

00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,750
and I have no evidence that the US

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:53,630
government wants to do a thing like that

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:56,720
so why were you I think you what you

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,910
speak loud and clearly having a

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,750
microphone doesn't eliminate the need to

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:09,130
speak loudly and clearly okay so my

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:13,670
question is about hardware which is

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:17,300
accessible for people who want to like

00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:20,510
dive into their hardware I wanted to

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:23,390
walk in here like the Poland

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:26,840
architecture their hard work well I feel

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:29,570
like the word open but the instructions

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:35,150
that has to be published or how can we

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:37,730
make our programs run on I don't even

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,740
know what open means in that context so

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,510
it's not the way I formulate my thoughts

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:49,580
but in the future when we can fabricate

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:51,840
Hardware for ourselves we should insist

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,470
on free hardware designs

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,799
Katie front take a look at the new that

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:04,370
org slash philosophy slash free hardware

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,370
design stop HTML thank you

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,409
so you put in the you know lectern

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,049
applause it was a it's a it's a good way

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,400
of being neutral between free software

00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:22,740
and open source I don't want to be

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:25,620
neutral so um I kind of take into

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,990
certain ease turn flow for the free the

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,460
great open not just went for the

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:36,779
software but also speech I've been set

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:39,419
up this is more because of a connotation

00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:42,720
that open is now something to understand

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:46,020
rather than be they open source so there

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,059
are two issues here one is terminology

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:52,850
and the other is whether it makes sense

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:56,880
to generalize about all these areas now

00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:00,179
free and cuts of the free apply the

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,130
software has a precise definition and if

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,950
this definition makes sense for other

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:08,130
kinds of works which are something that

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,860
you can have a copy of and then you can

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:16,559
change it doesn't make sense for

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:20,070
government the four freedoms to to apply

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,039
those concepts those criteria to of

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,260
government make some sense at all but

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,470
government that you're allowed to have a

00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,809
copy of and use it as you run it as

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:35,100
which for any purpose you don't run

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:37,620
government yourself and then you're

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,049
allowed personally does funny to change

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:44,029
this government are you a dictator

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:48,049
I don't you see it's an incoherent

00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:53,190
generalization I'm sorry to say that

00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:56,640
geeks tend to generalize too far they

00:31:53,190 --> 00:32:00,780
want to generalize everything but it's a

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,049
mistake in judging ethical issues to

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,899
generalize just cuz you

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:09,320
just because it sounds verbally facile

00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:12,739
even even when the generalization makes

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,299
sense it may still be wrong in area B

00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:16,299
even though it's right in area a

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:32,909
let me give an example is $5.00 a good

00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:36,360
price well it's a great price for a car

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:40,919
or a house it's a lousy price for

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,870
container of milk so the point is those

00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,620
even though those two questions have the

00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:52,289
same structure the same form the right

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:54,870
answer may not be the same I appreciate

00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:57,149
what you said about the handling of

00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,720
non-free firmware especially in things

00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:03,590
like virus and in in my own words I

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,409
interpret that to be the bias also

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,450
specifically to be able to enough

00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:09,870
properly considered it yeah no I don't

00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,269
think so

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,120
yeah that's not hard what I did try to

00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:17,100
fix em I wouldn't understand but one of

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,529
the issues with FiOS recently is that we

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,889
see things like boot kids and the

00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:26,039
funding of hardware buy a mattress and

00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:29,279
I'm wondering I kind of see that person

00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:32,010
is the next step after free free

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,940
software yes we need a free box I never

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,679
said any maybe listeners undercity I

00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:43,039
chose this computer crystal biases

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:47,779
freedoms and yes viruses can be malware

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,779
maybe you thought I said the opposite

00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,049
doesn't matter but we're just about

00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,419
there

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:56,960
I guess I'm just wondering it's if you

00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:04,559
have any guns on everything we handle a

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:07,649
non-free firmware in low at some point

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,839
as I said it doesn't make a difference

00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:12,629
whether something is a program or a

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,899
circuit it's very inside of the product

00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:19,310
and either one can be malicious they can

00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:22,470
make a special-purpose chip with with

00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:27,250
circuitry that such a certain thing like

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:30,570
crying home the point is

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:35,649
I can't wait for us to have a defense

00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:40,720
against malware at certain levels the

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:43,419
levels that we can reprogram when you go

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,520
hard enough down and we can't have

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,080
control over it whether it is some parts

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,450
of it or software or whether it's all

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:53,159
circuits you know we can't have control

00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:55,869
over it but it could still be malicious

00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:00,160
unfortunately my solution doesn't work

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:03,190
today at that if and when we can

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:09,609
fabricate our own ships the end my

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:16,060
solution won't work at that thank you

00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:18,220
very much so I don't know a lot of the

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:24,730
things that everybody else is talking

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:27,160
about here Wow so the direction my

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:40,690
question is well what's going to happen

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:43,420
if we be sacrificing control over the

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,980
future first thing but I can see

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:51,460
possibilities and people who already

00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:55,210
written about this spectrum it's now

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,150
possible for any device you use which

00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:02,940
has not free software to be cheating

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,940
you're tricking you in many subtle ways

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:13,839
the Volkswagen diesel pollution

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:16,180
deception shows that another kind of

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,490
malicious functionality that can be

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:27,550
present in proprietary software is lie

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:29,830
there what did she say

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,230
turns out actually like them they're not

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:39,960
some strong licorice those look good

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:39,960
I'll try this thank you anyway

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:52,640
it could be cheating you in any sort of

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:56,060
way it could be pretending to do to

00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:05,030
serve you and actually steering you

00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:07,750
towards a better B so we can't trust

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,750
non-free software

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:27,630
for perhaps a question and some and the

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,620
following question is rather than

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:36,940
reasonable now what is this movement

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:42,210
allowed to contribute to I don't know if

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,210
the changes basically at this point

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:51,190
super intelligent AI is something we can

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:54,670
imagine and speculate about we have no

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:58,210
experience with it it could wipe out

00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,870
humanity just because we happen to get

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:06,730
in the way

00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:10,330
I find it frightening now I wrote a

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:13,870
story in which it isn't threatening

00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:18,190
because we can all be enhanced and

00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:21,790
that's the possibility there's so many

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:28,140
possibilities thus we can't say what

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:32,740
will happen but we can be sure is that a

00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:35,710
super intelligent AI will be able to get

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:41,470
us to do whatever it wants us to do to

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:45,190
help it achieve his ends in my story

00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:49,780
there is a super intelligent AI that was

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:52,480
made to be my sweetheart I purchased the

00:38:49,780 --> 00:39:01,330
construction of this super intelligent

00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:03,930
AI and what she wants most of all is to

00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:08,680
get me to be in the a slacker

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:10,750
so I'll she eventually succeeds and she

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,120
said she at that ends with her saying

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,120
I'd never have let me failed here

00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:28,520
and if the super intelligent AI had laws

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:30,890
you it's going to tricky well but it has

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,520
to love you in the right deep rich

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,520
you're wet

00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,059
even busily e2 now the man ppl to kind

00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:51,289
of define the sense of user them I don't

00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:56,839
see why it would ever be necessary if an

00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:59,509
AI qualifies for what we now call human

00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:07,539
rights it would be treated by a free

00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:07,539
software just as you would ir thank you

00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:15,519
my name is seams work understood in

00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:24,709
understand but it is somewhere so what

00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:28,279
would you think about a pending like a

00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:32,589
dog breed palpable domain that's only

00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:32,589
service works like that okay

00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:42,199
it might be a nice thing to have but

00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:49,849
it's also seen crucial I'm suspect it's

00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:51,140
not feasible I suspect that I don't

00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:55,029
think we'd have much chance of

00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,029
convincing I can't do that

00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:13,429
well because it it's too much in bed

00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:17,749
with those with a lot of money actually

00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:22,159
we are trying to get I can to reserve

00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:28,519
dot new not for this kind of thing but

00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:32,479
instead for the new name system which is

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:37,699
an alternative to DNS but using dot

00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:42,319
canoe gets an embedded within DNS now

00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:45,349
this has is a more important need for a

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,489
top-level domain and they seem to be

00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:48,489
turning against us

00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,610
okay we have a hard stop on the

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,410
amplified questions the questions with

00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:59,500
microphones of six box so we got time

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,700
for maybe one two more and then look and

00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,520
then we'll continue questions up here

00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:09,340
section if that works up get an odd

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,170
death even of decades as you can working

00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,540
on the Free Software Foundation recently

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,250
to see what even stood the biggest

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,110
challenge and I know you said people

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,610
didn't see the future but what do you

00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:22,140
think might be the thing is challenged

00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,140
in the next ten or twenty years

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,570
the biggest obstacle I'm not sure I

00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:30,580
don't know what challenge means in this

00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:35,350
the biggest obstacle is very explorative

00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:38,710
social inertia for instance people were

00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:42,880
pressured by their friends to use sky

00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:47,080
anthesis to be used by a Facebook poll

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,820
by their schools to run Google's not

00:42:47,080 --> 00:43:01,560
free JavaScript and give up their

00:42:48,820 --> 00:43:07,180
privacy every time for one more question

00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:09,970
okay do you think that there is or

00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,880
should be such a thing as intellectual

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:18,400
property there isn't there never was

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:23,350
that term is confusing vagueness where -

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:28,750
it is Vegas and sloppiness there are

00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:33,420
many different things for instance

00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:37,150
copyright what this patent law exists

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,240
they have almost nothing in common in

00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,310
the US there's one sentence in the

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,890
Constitution that what arises through

00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,050
both in other countries they don't even

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,590
have that much in common they are

00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:53,470
totally different and if you try to

00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:57,700
generalize about them you will be led

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:58,750
astray and that's just two of the many

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,060
different

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:04,810
areas of law that people try to

00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,970
generalize about and by using the term

00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,400
quote intellectual property and every

00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,470
time they formulate a statement with

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,780
that term they're making the statement

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:19,990
about all of these different areas of

00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:22,720
law at once and they're wrong if you

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:26,920
want to understand any of these areas

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,890
the first step is don't use that term

00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,590
and don't believe anything you were told

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:38,040
using that term because it was regarded

00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:41,520
somebody might have found out a truth

00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:45,550
about one of these many areas of law and

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,890
saved it they believe is a hope

00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,840
intellectual property unquote instead of

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:54,880
spending which area of law it's really

00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:00,520
about and as a result of mating make it

00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:05,830
false and useless I have not used that

00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:11,290
term in over ten years because I saw

00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:13,840
that it was confusing now that we're all

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:17,550
accustomed to symptom property and of

00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:23,160
that invention attitude a spin like

00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:25,960
tyrosine apply to Sharon Collins there

00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,330
you can defeat the pocket of the

00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,680
propaganda aspect by putting it in scare

00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:36,790
quotes you know I would call it

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:41,050
forbidden sharing or or illegal copying

00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:46,140
or you know those are and those describe

00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:49,650
the same thing but without that spin but

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,730
when in propaganda confuses people by

00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:55,600
generalizing about things that are

00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:59,970
totally different putting it in square

00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,620
close doesn't help because that still

00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:05,590
treats it as a cook as if it were a

00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,480
coherent generalization the problem is

00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,029
that it confuses things that are

00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,479
different into fixed fast

00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:16,199
and you've got to say no I won't look

00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:19,479
for another word for this to be

00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:24,119
incoherent category I will talk about

00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:24,119
these specific things one bite of one

00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:32,249
thank you very much

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,520
and we'll fight against the TPP it's

00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,260
gotta be done now and also support

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,260
