For those of you who avoid youtube or prefer completely open formats for your media, we've posted a Theora/vorbis version of Richard Stallman's excellent keynote.  You can find it under "All Files" on its page at The Internet Archive:  https://archive.org/details/SeaGL2015RichardStallmanKeynote

P.S.  Yes, we are aware of Mr. Stallman's request at the beginning of his talk about how and were this talk should and should not be posted (we intentionally left that part in the video).  His concerns for this official recording are that no one should have to give up any freedoms in order to watch it (e.g. by using a proprietary platform like Youtube).  This is one of the many reasons that we have provided the fully free and open Theora/vorbis version.
