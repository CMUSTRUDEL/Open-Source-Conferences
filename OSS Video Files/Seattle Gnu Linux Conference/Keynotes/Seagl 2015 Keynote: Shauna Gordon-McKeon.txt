and now it is my great pleasure to

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,690
introduce you to Shana Gordon McKeon a

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,210
woman who has many hats she's a

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,330
community activist a Java programmer a

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,939
Python programmer PHP she has to a data

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,910
scientist a writer a free software

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,369
community activist for open hatch she

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,619
also works on Civic tech and open

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,570
science and if there's something she

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,450
doesn't do it's probably not worth doing

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:51,120
so here she is shiny Lord maccon's thank

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:53,220
you hello hi everyone it is a pleasure

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,820
and an honor to be here today with you

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,310
I'm a little nervous my first keynote

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,020
but I've been nervous before giving my

00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,730
first talk teaching my first workshop

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,739
making my first major contribution to a

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,040
project and it's all sort out before

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,270
it's obvious if we go workout today I

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,850
was invited to this talk about eight

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,790
months ago and I was asked to talk about

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,200
it how newcomers could get started

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,940
concerning two projects and how products

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,830
can make themselves more welcoming to

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,710
newcomers and I said yes of course I've

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,810
spent it's 102 years as a part-time

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,790
director for but actually to the

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,330
nonprofit that tries to help people get

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,770
more involved in free software have

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,380
spent a lot of time to talk to a lot of

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,970
people newcomers and old timer is nice

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,729
and professionals and passionate

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,299
volunteers learned about a lot of

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,130
projects heard a lot of war stories so

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,600
I've got a lot of advice to give a lot

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,800
of stories to tell and I could stand up

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,380
here all day I'm talking

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,810
about that but I've only got an hour and

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,520
as I sat down to write I realized that I

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,850
wanted to talk about something a little

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,470
bit different yeah there are a lot of

00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,940
projects out there a lot of individual

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,110
projects on a lot of ways to teach me to

00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,570
them but I'm going to talk about the

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,930
ways they contribute to be free software

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,220
project the community as a whole this

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,510
this wonderful group that you've got

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,460
here and around the world and so I want

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,610
to talk about some of the open issues in

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,830
the free software project to the ongoing

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,360
problems that we're still working on and

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,150
all of the people who are attacking

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
those things to me these are the

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,290
greatest opportunities for contribution

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,640
the most interesting and exciting and

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,190
potentially impactful this talk is about

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,290
report I'm going to highlight some meta

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,610
problems and maybe even the talk is over

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,640
you'll want to add to the report be like

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,440
yeah I sure could replicate that maybe

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,210
I'll silence defer this until later when

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,640
we're ready to work on head home and you

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,350
may even say I don't think this is a bug

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
I think it's a feature you label it as

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,060
won't fix and move on I hope you won't

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,680
do that that's okay my purpose here is

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,630
really just to articulate these issues

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,940
so that once we've articulated them we

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,780
can start addressing them or continuous

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,370
crossing them so this talk this bug

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,739
report is not meant to discourage anyone

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,209
it's not going to be a criticism of the

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,520
community or say it's broken or not

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,940
we're contributing tail on the contrary

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,920
it is inactive affection

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,980
excited this project the free software

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,260
project is beautiful and valuable and

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,930
like all things a perfect and I want to

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,120
work on making it better so I'm going to

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,020
begin my tell you a bit about myself

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,460
long before I was a free software

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,340
contributor or a programmer at all I was

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,500
a moral psychologist what is he in

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,470
collagen for a few years after i looked

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,260
at more behaviors altruism cooperation

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,440
aggression punishment and i studied them

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,630
using a variety of different methods i

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,030
studied monkeys I collected vials of

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,850
people skip and analyze the performance

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,320
and the mixed up people enjoy antagonist

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,920
to see how their brain look like and

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,860
they were thinking about their values so

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,390
an example of a giant magnet I was the

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,100
jointed magnets that got me into free

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,280
software actually in a roundabout sort

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,830
of way it turns out that fMRI generates

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,080
a ton of data and in order to process

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,420
and analyze this data I had to learn how

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,370
to program and so my very first

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,110
programming languages to have that you

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,419
may know that MATLAB is not a free

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,980
software project it is whatever the

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,930
opposite of a free software project is

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,000
it is neither pregame speech or free as

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,610
in beer it didn't cost up to two

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,890
thousand dollars for a license so when I

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,150
decided to leave academia I had to do

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,470
matlab behind and I also felt as though

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,710
I was leaving my ability to contribute

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,690
to science behind over time I discovered

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,900
free software science projects like

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,680
octave side I and i discovered open

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,350
science communities like the

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,180
science and in fact i'm currently one of

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,400
many authors on a collaborative science

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,770
project paper that's in submission right

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,320
now which i use a bunch of free software

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,440
projects like sci fi are the ipython

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,389
project and the open science framework

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,669
so that's a part of my free software

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,009
origin story have my path up to this

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,039
stage but it also tells you that about

00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,870
how I in the world I look at the world

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,030
in my seat values what I look at people

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,280
I wonder what value to motivate them and

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,039
when I see a complet I think what shared

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,789
values did people this conflict had that

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,410
can help us resolve it priests offered

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:37,160
to me is not just a bunch of hardware

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,229
and software but a system of people and

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,099
the values that motivate them beneath

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:45,110
the code the heart so maybe you don't

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,639
think this is a useful way of looking in

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,780
the world that's totally fine but you're

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,030
stuck with it for the duration of this

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:55,039
job I'm curious before we continue are

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,930
there any values that keep on the

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,430
audience have that like really resonate

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,430
them and draw them to free software

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:09,039
toleration freedom freedom of speech

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,039
privacy

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,290
short for chase the ability to modify

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,290
things

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,240
yeah building on what others have done

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:32,590
before if you don't just shout really

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,590
loud in the back user environment

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:51,350
kindness yes absolutely democracy my

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,610
penguin everything being able to figure

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,990
out what's wrong when something goes

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,750
wrong I I thought about this for a while

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,020
I came up with the four most important

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,750
values to me for free software that's

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,360
empowerment the empowerment as a lot of

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,260
people were saying it being able to

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,840
understand what's going wrong make

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:18,590
changes the commons the sort of shared

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,600
the shared creation whether that's a

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,030
piece of software or if it's like the

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,530
shared project of understanding the

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,870
world through science such a big one for

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,280
me the connections that you make with

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,260
individuals in the community when you

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,720
work together the act of giving to one

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,190
another an openness not actually even

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,310
that much about the openness of code

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,750
with luminous of the community I thought

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,100
when I left science is was not going to

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,700
be able to do science but because I

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,110
found the open science community and the

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,300
free software scientific community I

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,980
found people who didn't care whether or

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,350
not it was a Philly

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,900
with an institution and we're happy to

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:58,920
Center my contributions on your own

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:02,080
terms there's another reason what

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,030
skipped ahead to get back to the bug

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,100
report metaphor I'm just talking about

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:10,210
how I operate on my operating system

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,160
what kind of dependencies I'm using in

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,880
science we call that a compound in

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,590
politics maybe even called a bias

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,500
dependencies compounds biases they're

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,810
all inevitable what's important is to

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,970
talk about them to make an explicit so

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,680
that you know this that are there and so

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,020
that can change in detail or you can

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,520
work on changing money there's another

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,160
reason I'm telling you this origin story

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,470
on this because the first bug report i'm

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:40,300
going to make it's been a problem for me

00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:43,270
from the very beginning kind of small

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,180
soul weeded out loud bug report number

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,190
one the expected behavior communities

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,850
whose values overlap with free software

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,220
will use free software actual behavior

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,140
only small pockets of these communities

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:02,590
seem to be aware of in using free

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:06,400
software and then the first free

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,170
software contribution in 2011 it was to

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,800
a small project that was being run by

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,500
Mako hill now he was in the area I sent

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,690
him an email that said you should make a

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,850
change on this line or change this

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,670
number on this line of dis file which is

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,560
in this directory and ultimately refused

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,570
to do that he was like you need to fit

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,710
of passion was like what's badge so he

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,750
walked me through the whole process that

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,430
it was good fun I said it was also kind

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,490
of sad because why was I learning about

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,390
this from Mako in 2011 when I should

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,230
have been learning about it from my

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,060
science

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,410
seven years before that's the better

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,730
part of a decade when I could have been

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,170
contributing to pretty software and

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,230
doing open science and I wasn't because

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,760
I didn't really know that it existed the

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,490
scientific community is hardly the only

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,020
community that one might expect to

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,060
embrace free software that did not quite

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,680
there yet for several years I've been

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,990
involved in the open government then

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,720
also called the transparency winter

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,130
Civic tech it's a bunch of folks who are

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,740
pushing for accountability and

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,760
transparency in government and they do

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,560
by a large embrace pause but in their

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,530
own movement but they're still somewhat

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,380
small and so only a small fraction of

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,640
political activists and public officials

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,950
really know about it and brings new

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,090
software libraries are yet another group

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,510
I don't know too much about libraries

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,830
and mostly just an enthusiastic patron

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,390
but I'm kinds of several librarians and

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,260
they tell me that the exception of a few

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,580
free software projects related to ILS

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,340
integrated library systems whatever

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,530
those are for the most part libraries on

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,730
proprietary software which is

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:44,380
heartbreaking because when you think

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:46,480
about libraries they they are their role

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,300
in our society is to share information

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,180
and to empower individuals through the

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,400
sharing of that information and so I

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,920
think that every librarian should be a

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,270
free saw grandpa hit and every free

00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,980
software advocate should be a little bit

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,530
in love with libraries but yet there's

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:08,200
this disconnect and so okay so I defined

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,060
a problem here people who should be

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,520
using free software aren't what can we

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,140
do about it I'm so this is this is

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,850
obviously a complex issue which differs

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,680
from group to group in there are a

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,660
number of contributing factors for

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,340
instance in the sciences there

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:27,070
is this there's for-profit publishers

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,790
which dampen openness in many forms

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,200
there's a pressure to not be scooped in

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,340
government citizens procurement

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,990
processes that I've heard are a

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,980
nightmare there's all these like

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,400
political issues involved so there's a

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,400
variety of different of different on of

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,470
different ones apply and there are a

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:54,490
number of excellent organizations that

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:56,170
are working on this type once again this

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,960
is very small so just call out a couple

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,680
of them there's the scientific Python

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,330
community side by 5 pandas not called

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,430
Leah but I've contributed a couple of

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,080
times to side I they're wonderful

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,090
welcoming community I recommend them

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,400
there's the software carpenter group

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,470
this is a group that goes around to

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,050
universities and colleges it provides

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,890
workshops to teach scientists about

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,210
technical tools like version control

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,770
databases things like that they're big

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,300
for software components in another

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,130
favorite of mine is the public lab a

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,160
citizen science group that does open

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,260
source free software and hardware and

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,570
engages people to do scientific research

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,390
on the world around them to look at

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,910
poison and our toxicity and soil and

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,130
water they've done balloon mapping of

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,470
oil spills lots of really cool stuff

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,390
going on I'm in the Civic tech sphere

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,670
there's the sunlight foundation they do

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:56,250
they try to make date about the

00:12:51,670 --> 00:13:01,680
government available they take these

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,180
they funnel through from the source at

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,240
from the government source which is not

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,220
always in the best format for intake and

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,750
make these like really lovely API is out

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,710
of them

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,750
of all the free software libraries

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,240
there's a group called phosphor violin

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,200
and there's a bigger group that doesn't

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,880
called code for life the open iOS

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,020
systems I was talking about before cova

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,470
and evergreen until this I poses many

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:34,160
other groups which i haven't mentioned

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,210
which are also working as a sphere I

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,230
want to take a moment though to look at

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,730
this from the values based perspective

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,310
like I wanted you I would so the reason

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,770
why I expect that scientists political

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,030
activists librarians would all be using

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,770
free software's because I've seen them

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,250
as sharing the same values as free

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,870
software advocates openness love of

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,390
shared knowledge of desire to power the

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,770
individual so are there other values

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,710
values that were prioritizing

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:05,310
differently that are causing into the

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,270
alienation and I think there are so the

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,090
first one I want to talk about is

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,090
usability so the free software community

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,930
has a disproportionate number of

00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,589
programmers and developers in it

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,350
compared to the general population and

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,089
because we're familiar with with

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,510
software we have a higher a higher

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,570
threshold for ability to use difficult

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,710
tools whereas people like scientists

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,510
librarians and government officials

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,580
despite being brilliant of hard working

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,760
they only have so much time in the day

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,940
and so much space in their brains and so

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,530
just as the average software contributor

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,540
might want to be able to read a science

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,040
news headline and understand and trust

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,470
that news without having to go to go to

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,570
the primary research article or even to

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,880
the data to analyze it for themselves a

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,769
scientist once paid program that they

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,259
can just use without having to spend

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:02,429
time reading documentation and debugging

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:05,610
like an installation process software

00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:07,470
poor usability is not nearly impractical

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,800
its alienating because it implies that

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,869
the people who are using the tools there

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,939
their time is it does important that the

00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,619
work of researching diseases are helping

00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:18,809
a patron find the resources they need

00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:20,670
are not as valuable as the time they

00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:24,360
could be spending debugging reading

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:26,100
documentation now over time the free

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,470
software community has come to do a lot

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,769
of work on usability I'm not meaning to

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,170
apply that no one cares about usability

00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,790
but I would love to see more more

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,249
spreading around with some of the great

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,439
tools and processes that people have

00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:42,179
done so prisons Debbie Nicholson a

00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,309
couple years ago and he break on it did

00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,410
something which she called spinach con

00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,600
which is when she got together a bunch

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,839
of project leads and users that had them

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,929
doing his ability sprint and heard great

00:15:51,839 --> 00:16:00,769
things for that but Devas are reserved

00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:02,879
or a follow-up spinach time enough I

00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,429
happen to think there should be tons of

00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,170
follow-up spinach cons not no pressure

00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,819
on me personally but the community as a

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,269
whole should be doing these abilities

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:15,329
prints which are not but not that much

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,920
work and open source bridge in a couple

00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,480
of years ago I saw topped by jen

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,459
davidson doing what's called a

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,649
think-aloud which is when you take a

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:28,259
project container and somebody's

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,970
completely new to the project and the

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,449
person is completely new the project if

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,610
starts trying to do a task while just

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,959
saying aloud what does thinking where

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,939
they're getting stuck and might be like

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,350
get to a point to be like wow i have no

00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:41,459
idea what to do next its button isn't

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,589
doing what i think it should be doing

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:47,069
I'm the maintainer is right there and

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:49,410
able to able to take those notes and

00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,869
make those fixers so this is it this is

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,029
amit can take 15 minutes it's also a

00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:56,040
great way to involve in tumors in your

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,839
project is in fact a newcomer so it was

00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,010
never seeing the project before is the

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,240
absolute best

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,770
to do this so it's a way to improve the

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,990
usability of your project and also to

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:13,589
help familiarize on my second project so

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:16,949
a women another another value which i

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,540
think is worth talking about his privacy

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,880
there are a number of free software

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,220
projects which practice radical openness

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,370
which is cool and sound right but I

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,720
think it's important to talk about where

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,070
privacy and openness intercept and

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,410
sometimes come into conflict with each

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,180
other when I was a neuroscience

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,160
researcher I did almost entirely human

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,890
subjects research except for when I was

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,630
working with the monkeys and I counted a

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,370
lot of very sensitive personal data and

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,780
as much as I would love to be able to

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,820
share that data as much as it would have

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,320
helped the you know the great human

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,030
project of science I couldn't and that's

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,650
for a very good reason I'm going to see

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,450
this tension also with government data

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,310
there are kinds of government data which

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,080
citizens should absolutely had the right

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,660
to but there's other government denied

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,490
for instance census data health data tax

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,210
data that gets collected that should

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,530
remain private there's some teaching

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,630
approaches to this particular conflict

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,310
one of my favorite is open humans North

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,590
formerly known as the Personal Genome

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:19,680
Project where they they asked

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,350
participants to voluntarily give their

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,500
data to the public and in return the

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:29,400
researchers who use this data make a

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:33,300
promise to to engage with the

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,090
participants to explain their research

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,600
and to basically treat them with sort of

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,310
respective partners in the process which

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,680
i think is I think it's fantastic that

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,600
being said that's just one relatively

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,110
small project and whole great realm of

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,790
science so it's not

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:53,830
CA I actually think that when it comes

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,650
to protecting individuals from invasive

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,090
monitoring the free software community

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,170
has been a real champion in the space

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,790
free software projects like tor DPG

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,540
cryptocat privacy badger just to name a

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:10,679
few there are successful vital projects

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,570
which this community has created I

00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,790
talked to Allison macrina founder of the

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:19,780
library Freedom Project I guess I'll

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,309
read this one out to kind of small well

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,960
it's important that people don't over

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:24,700
trust their software and recognize that

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,830
all software has the potential to be

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,419
compromised fossils by definition the

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,610
only software that can help you resist

00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:32,230
surveillance since the source code is

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,850
shared openly becomes much harder for

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,350
malicious after like a government

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,660
intelligence agency to insert a back

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,309
door I would rather put my trust in a

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,440
community of relatively like-minded

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,840
people who value transparency privacy

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,580
and freedom rather than blacks bak black

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,110
box software from companies that have

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,490
already violated our trust and our

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,919
White's so I think it was a great

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,840
articulation of just how well open to

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,240
some privacy can work together but

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,730
nevertheless privacy if your openness is

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,710
not exactly an intuitive idea and it's

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,460
not enough to create these projects for

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:09,490
people who already grasped the idea for

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,559
people who people who are from this

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,120
community and so actually privacy

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,520
focused projects have put a great deal

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,130
of effort into making their tools more

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,440
usable on Allison who runs the library

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,790
Freedom Project teaches librarian about

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,070
surveillance threats and the tools that

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,630
can come back them she also pointed out

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,610
to me that the Tor project runs regular

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,080
usability sprints and that they've hired

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,179
a communications director who came from

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,429
an activist background I mean every

00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:37,120
month just a few blocks down for me as a

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:39,280
crypto part in some ways those focused

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,020
on individual privacy I represent the

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,650
best of free software outreach efforts

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,440
and they've put a lot of effort into

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,110
making their tools usable and there

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,639
understandable and I want people to feel

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,950
this way about pretty software in

00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,690
general I want them to know that we care

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,580
about this issue we recognize the issue

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,350
and that our cheerleading for openness

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:03,000
is happening to shut down the concerns

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,129
about privacy a third value which I

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,750
think's close the adoption of free

00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:12,450
software and other spaces I is education

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,220
in science in government in a lot of

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,860
spaces there's a lot more effort

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,200
emphasis put on structured education and

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,289
methods environment there are classes to

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,750
take text books to read teachers to

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,879
mentor you there are clear paths of

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,179
advancement and in free software we've

00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:34,610
got less of that which brings me to my

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:37,860
next bug report bug report number tail

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,389
expected behavior people with interest

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,889
in free software and a willingness to

00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:43,230
work hard will be able to find a place

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:45,419
contributing to the community actual

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,860
behavior despite their interests many

00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,620
people get frustrated and give up on

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,330
your Tribune has been a goodly portion

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,399
of the last two years focusing on this

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,379
issue and I've got a lot to say about it

00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,940
rather too much to say so i'm going to

00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,350
put most of that made references at the

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,870
end of the topic from pollen to make

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,529
your interested i'll just give you the

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:08,190
cliff notes version which is that a lot

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:09,629
of people who don't a lot of people want

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,009
to contribute it don't will contribute a

00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,990
couple of times and not continue on

00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:14,820
there are a number of practical hurdles

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,649
and some of these hurdles are poorly

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,889
specified development environments and

00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:21,929
set up processes newcomer unfamiliarity

00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:24,929
with communication tools and cultural

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:26,539
norm and issues sitting in trackers that

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:28,309
just rely too much on the implicit

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,440
familiarity and knowledge of the project

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:34,769
and how the project works that newcomers

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,559
just can't access i'll give you a couple

00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:39,539
of practical solutions this is an image

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,090
from an open hatch workshop at Purdue

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,559
University a couple of years ago there

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,179
was a group of students who wanted to

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,879
contribute to a project who spent

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,110
basically three hours during our free

00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,940
form contributions

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,960
period just trying to get the project

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,670
setup and I remember we asked them for

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,260
feedback about what their experience had

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,690
been like and to list the obstacles they

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,490
faced and there was like you know

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,929
dependencies you aren't aware of we have

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:08,190
to sign up for an account there were

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:10,500
tears out in our vision so then they had

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,630
a lot of fun not everyone has a ton of

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,679
fun trying to set up a development

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,140
environment that takes several hours

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,270
action is a happy ending to the story so

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,770
we wrote about it on my blog the good

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,710
people of privily that the project was

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,419
for read the blog and they were like oh

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,840
we should we should work on our setup

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:30,419
process so they I think they open them

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,330
closely like 11 or 17 some prime number

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,650
of bugs in the space of a day and when I

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,280
heard about this this gave me the idea

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,020
for setups prints where you take a

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,520
potential new contributor and take a

00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,690
project maintainer and you have them try

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,880
to install the project and they as the

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,080
problems come up you just give them and

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,390
feed them directly to the maintainer

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,830
it's a lot like a think 11 in certain

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,480
ways so it's one practical solution

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,299
another solution that I came up with to

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,490
the problem of not knowing how to use

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,710
communication tools about cultural norms

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,169
is welcomed by well combined is about to

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,570
consider your IRC channel and if someone

00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:11,760
new not on the list of new nicknames

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,830
comes into the channel and no one talks

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,600
for a period of time default is 60

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,370
seconds the Bob will welcome them

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,030
they'll say hey I'm a bot no one's

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:23,340
around it pains channel regulars it

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,750
gives you an email address or some other

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,910
way to get in touch and basically says

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:31,260
hey thanks for coming we like you if you

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,580
didn't know here's all these other ways

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,299
to get in touch and ways to think about

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,880
how I resume work so so those are two

00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,140
practical solutions but let's forget to

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:48,480
go solutions for a moment to talk about

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:51,210
values at me so I want to talk about two

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,350
ways of approaching this issue the first

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:58,690
is respecting the skill of teaching

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,250
teaching is a lot like coding both our

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,260
activities which require effort and

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,790
thoughtfulness to improve their skills

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,710
that some people will have actually

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,510
we're naturally that other people have

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,549
more interest in that others and their

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,480
activities that most people ought to try

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,730
at least once arguably in our society

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,010
coding as a skill is associated with the

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,140
men and masculinity and teaching is the

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,900
gender to spend one and I think this is

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,670
part of the reason why teaching has been

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,340
relatively devalued compared to coding

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:30,490
and for software which hurts everybody

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,020
people who want to teach are often given

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,299
I that their resources or training they

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,290
need to do well whereas other people who

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,150
are not that interested in teaching

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,230
nevertheless feel that Oh anyone should

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,809
be able to teach and I'm kind of

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:45,270
confused as to why this seems to be so

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:48,070
hard a year or so ago I had the

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:51,010
maintainer of a software project asked

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,809
me for my advice she was having this

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,010
issuer people were constantly coming up

00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:55,720
to her and offering are held in her

00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,500
project but it was never actually the

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,390
help she needed and a long time is in

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,360
order to be able to contribute to her

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,309
project they need a lot of mentorship to

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,540
be taught a number in tolls and that

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,790
just wasn't her priority at the moment

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,080
so I said to her it sounds like these

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,419
people are just not a good fit for you

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,160
there's nothing wrong with politely

00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,540
rejecting an offer and help not every

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,480
free software project needs to be

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,070
welcoming to newcomers and in fact

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,650
you're doing people a favor by releasing

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,880
them and helping them to go find a

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,730
project where they're people who are

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,140
actively interested in mentoring and a

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,020
design and work towards making their

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,360
projects more accessible and I think

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,040
that's a good general thing to

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,170
understand that it's okay to have a free

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,330
software project

00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,160
base of one it's okay to have a project

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,450
that plainly states the standards for

00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,360
contributions and says we don't have

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,770
time to help you meet those standards

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,130
but we will accept your contributions

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,340
that they do meet these standards

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,290
education is it's a test it takes time

00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,190
and energy and skills that not everyone

00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,930
has just like coding by actively valuing

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,280
education you can help make sure that

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,890
the people teaching actually want to

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,730
teach them there are a number of

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,320
organizations that support teaching

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,050
teaching faust contribution the big

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,340
studies is google Summer of Code I what

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,710
I like about google summer of code is

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,110
that they explicitly paid mentors value

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,360
in valuing that teaching role there's

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,250
also outreaching I love outer G it's

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,390
smaller and not funded by a giant tech

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:30,750
corporation but it also allows people to

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:33,660
get paid for doing non-coding work for

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,620
projects including teaching there's also

00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:40,140
a project to send project assignment has

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,990
run once and will hopefully run again it

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,870
works with underemployed participants so

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:50,070
focus on that people who really need on

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:55,920
paid internships there are a number of

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:57,720
other Fox workshops and programs there's

00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,490
a link to these slides so even if you

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,570
can't sell them if you're interested in

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:05,340
these things you can just piss at the

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:07,170
slides later the other thing I want to

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,260
talk about as regards to education is

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,000
the myth of the self-talk programmer you

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,260
may have heard this one before I hear it

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,090
a lot I've had people come up to make

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,340
conferences and sort of someone

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,930
aggressively saying oh we don't need we

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,760
don't need this education and outreach

00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:24,120
to people that you get to education and

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,900
outreach are incompetent lazy people so

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,340
I find this insulting but but beneath

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,350
the himself I think that there's

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,330
actually a value there and it's in value

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,710
that I share which is the desire that

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,830
the people in the community being

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:41,160
empowered that they feel a sense of self

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,410
sufficiency and an ability to understand

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:47,240
different projects to gain knowledge to

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:49,650
help each other people you see an

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,650
obstacle and feel this desire to tackle

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,030
it so in this way the people that come

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,730
up attends to me I'm like me how we

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:58,140
become on the same place but we get go

00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,970
to different completely different place

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,090
because their model of self-sufficiency

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,940
as an arrow it fits only a certain type

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,250
of person one person who's Brittany and

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,320
talked a lot about this is Mel chua she

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,050
talks all about learning styles so for

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,010
example one kind of spectrum of learning

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,540
is active versus reflective and

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,820
programming in costs tend to favor an

00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,560
active learning style so an active

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,230
learner is when you'll exit dive into

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,030
things to think about things out loud to

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,880
just try stuff and as they try stuff

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,050
they gather information oh oh I run into

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,240
an obstacle let me try this thing

00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,470
whereas a reflective learner is more the

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,690
kind of person who would like take a

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,750
step back try to understand the system

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,730
as a whole before before diving in and

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,770
so reflective learners might have a

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,260
harder time finding

00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,600
software I've been to put myself to be

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,430
kind of a reflective learner sometimes

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,840
when I ask for help in an IRC channel

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,790
and someone mentions a word I don't know

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,350
I'm like you're in fact I are going to

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,450
10,000 word essay about what this means

00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:00,140
and how it fits into my overall model in

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,060
this project the ability to say that the

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,980
self confidence in self knowledge comes

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,410
from getting comfortable in the space if

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,430
I'm talking to people like my and it's

00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:12,550
not something that all newcomers can do

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,740
Mel is also an accessibility advocate

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,480
she writes what might be accessible to

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,040
one group might not work for another and

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,840
we aren't always thoughtful about how to

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,060
make more about things more available to

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,650
everyone for instance how many of our

00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,780
programs are screen reader friendly for

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,160
the blind and low-vision community how

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,720
many times do not native English

00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,370
speakers get left out of meetings or

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,780
silence during conversations because we

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:37,760
don't pause for them to keep up the

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,310
foster the model also privileges people

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,720
with their resource to experiment k boss

00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,060
calls us the privilege of breaking

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,590
things there people can't take the

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,870
chance of accidentally breaking their

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,670
computer for a few days or can't afford

00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,240
to avoid the orange and by jailbreaking

00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,430
on reading their phone when we embrace

00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,050
self sufficiency in all of its forms and

00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,780
open up new opportunities for community

00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,040
great it's not simply that a greater

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,440
number and variety people can

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,960
participate by actively teaching

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,490
self-sufficiency we empower all members

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,150
of our communities to contribute in you

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,400
in other ways in other words telling you

00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,690
to be there read the bleep in manual you

00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,880
point them in the right direction and

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:20,060
making ellen even forever but teaching

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
me how to read the db9 and you've taught

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,990
them how to find their own directions

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,580
and maybe just maybe next week when

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,220
someone else asks for something that's

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,710
on that page the newcomer will speak up

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,380
and teach that that even you are you

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,810
cover how the project works how to read

00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,510
the doctor

00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,490
I see what's happenin positive learning

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,140
environments for instance at outreach

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,290
workshops and in places like the open at

00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,140
Ryerson channel so how do we go about

00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,180
this we can explicitly say to view value

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,580
self-sufficiency persistence

00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,530
independence of thought and we can teach

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,750
the skills and practical ways of showing

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,180
newcomers how to read documentation how

00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,460
to ask good questions how to estimate

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,370
just how likely something is to break

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,170
the computer I have some suggested

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,210
phrases if you've ever seen me to talk

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,680
before and I've suggested phrases i'm

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,510
not going to read them out but if this

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,850
if this all sounds interesting to you or

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:16,920
I suggest that you go find my slides and

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:19,380
look at the suggestion fragrant of

00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,420
course teaching these skills requires

00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,610
putting some effort into your work as a

00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,590
teacher and so these two elements both

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:33,110
self-sufficiency and valuing teaching go

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:35,970
hang on to the next bug report money

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,590
expected behavior everyone is able to

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,980
contribute to cost is that suffering

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,690
financial hardship actual behavior the

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,340
faust contributor base is largely one of

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,410
economic privilege and many people

00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,110
contribute do so well struggling

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,670
financially and there's been a fair

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,770
amount of debate about compensation

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:55,140
payment for free software which is

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,880
hardly surprising money is one of the

00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,530
most contentious topic spaces and if the

00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
wider world has not figured out a way to

00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,450
deal with the money that everyone's cool

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,550
about we're not going to eat it but we

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,200
can still strive to be better and it's

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,820
important that we do so because having

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,530
more financial resources will help us to

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,130
address a lot of these other end open

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:16,830
issues so what's the current status quo

00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,460
and boss she's actually a number of ways

00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,059
that you

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,500
to develop boss there are businesses for

00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,809
instance Red Hat that create entirely

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,090
free projects and sell support services

00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:30,240
for them there are faust frameworks like

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,539
django wordpress drupal etc who support

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,770
a robust economy based on customization

00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,090
there are tech companies who pay

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,679
employees to contribute to a class

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,539
project such as the Linux kernel and

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,220
there are nonprofits and similar

00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,779
organizations would get which get

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,740
funding through grants and donations and

00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,470
therefore don't need to worry about

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,299
monetizing their products and these

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,830
options cover a lot of people you are

00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,090
interested in getting paid to work at

00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,880
the software there are definitely

00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,710
opportunities in super soon however the

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,020
majority of cost contributions are

00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,580
stolen hey this is an inherently a

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,110
problem there are a lot of people who

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,570
enjoy giving their time in their efforts

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,880
to the wider community but there are

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,230
still some practical problems for

00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,379
instance the work of the newcomers is

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:11,369
almost always uncommon sated you see me

00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,649
that people who are not financially

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,060
privileged enough to work for free don't

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,950
need to participate in free software

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,869
which provides a great big Phil join in

00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,669
fact for the economic diversity of our

00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,440
community there are some organizations

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:24,659
which work to address this disparity

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,399
including as I mentioned before google

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:32,730
summer of code project defend and

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:34,919
outreach ii another issue this time some

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,800
people can't contribute to free software

00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,780
as a hobby people who have health issues

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,490
people who care for dependents people

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,440
who work multiple jobs or go to school

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,899
full time and work simply don't have the

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,639
space to contribute to free software

00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:52,889
unless it's taking the role of work

00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,020
under lives another issue is which kind

00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,330
of work gets con consented compensated

00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,000
we're stuck in a bit of a vicious cycle

00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,800
in that we value coding / teaching

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,530
design another

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,880
onward and because we value the more

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,230
were more likely to pay people to work

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,730
on one but because we're more likely to

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,300
pay people to work on them to get to see

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:13,580
the potential of code to to make changes

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,530
in a way that we don't for teaching or

00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,510
design or some of these other ways to

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,520
contribute and because we get to see

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,620
their potential interaction we value the

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,520
more and because we got even where we

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,680
pay people more circle now some people

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,590
instinctively dislike the idea of paying

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,140
people for class contributions again I

00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,210
understand this perspective let's look

00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,780
again at values these people see free

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,250
software as a kind of gift economy each

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,210
contribution is a gift to the community

00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:46,910
and it thrives on reciprocity paying

00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,860
people would warp things and that's a

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,380
reasonable fear in psychology we call

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,120
this a motivational parting if you give

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,800
little kids a task and then start

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,570
rewarding some of the kids for the test

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,790
there was that get reward will be less

00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,300
enthusiastic about doing the task when

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,880
they don't have a reward another example

00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,230
of this is in a study with daycare

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,970
providers who are having trouble with

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,470
parents picking up students late they

00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,050
said all right we're going to impose a

00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:14,270
fine and the people once they impose to

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:17,030
find the parents were even later because

00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,920
they figured oh well I'm paying for to

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:21,320
come late and they no longer felt that

00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,490
they needed to empathize with the

00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,220
inconvenience that were causing the

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:29,660
daycare providers so like I get I get

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:31,480
money could work them there's another

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,770
element to play here which is fairness

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,770
why should some people get paid well

00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:41,009
so this is partially this excuse to show

00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:42,930
you a picture of some key monkeys but

00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:44,309
there's a point at the monkey love

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,529
arrived at a graduate student did a

00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:48,089
study with monkeys who are given

00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:51,029
cucumbers in exchange for doing tasks

00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:54,630
since I community I think was giving it

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:56,309
a lot so you'd give a monkey a cucumber

00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,809
or you hold out your hand the monkey

00:36:56,309 --> 00:37:00,269
would put a rock into your hand and give

00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:01,769
it a cucumber and do like sweet and then

00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:05,069
so whatever the hell they panic doing

00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:06,599
well so they did this Henry you one of

00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,880
the monkey is a cucumber then they give

00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,949
the next Monday great can you imagine a

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,599
curry then there was act the first month

00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:15,180
you gave a cucumber and the monkey was

00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,009
like you know it that when he gets a

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,979
great Undead it didn't say that but it

00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:21,930
did throw the cucumber on foot I loved

00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:23,969
her I Jeff of this and couldn't find it

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,459
but my slides link to the YouTube video

00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:27,449
so if you want to seem to be angry

00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:29,309
morally outraged monkey through our

00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:32,969
cucumber on Oprah we're just go to my

00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:35,160
slides okay so what is the point of that

00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:37,219
we primates care a lot about fairness

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,719
these are like very fundamental values

00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:41,339
the thing though is that arguments for

00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,109
paying people to contribute to Prasad

00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:46,559
where can also be made in the name of

00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:49,529
gotham community it everyone was the

00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,900
same then a gift of an hour of time or

00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:54,299
50 lines of code or a hundred words of

00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,099
documentation would be the same but

00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:56,999
people are different and they come from

00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,099
different backgrounds that have

00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:00,959
different in strings an hour of time

00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,999
from someone who is struggling to pay

00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,049
the rent is very different from an hour

00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:08,119
time from someone who would otherwise

00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:08,119
just spend an evening in fun video games

00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:14,249
community is also community in turn is

00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:16,619
promoted by protecting the security and

00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:19,680
happiness of community members and

00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:22,380
embracing the diversity deck financial

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,269
compensation allows so basically we all

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,739
want the same thing we want a happy

00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:28,859
community where everyone is treated

00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:31,410
fairly but here in a failure

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:34,470
have a started capacity China of course

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:38,309
even if Ronaldo degree on the importance

00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:40,230
of paying people we might be difficult

00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:42,269
to put into practice for although there

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,390
are opportunities for paid work and free

00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:50,239
software we don't have a robust model

00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:52,890
that everyone can use there are some

00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,690
there are many important projects that

00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,309
are underfunded and many people who are

00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,599
in Boston want pain but we don't

00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:01,950
currently have consequently there are

00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,349
some people who create and relief

00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:07,079
software that is not precisely free yet

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,670
share some of our values for instance of

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,140
people some projects release their

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,420
source code but don't license people

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,609
don't use it others create systems which

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,880
are only mostly open but retain certain

00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:20,670
elements is proprietary there are people

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,680
that argue for a sort of purity of free

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,079
software purpose I mean I totally I

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,249
empathize with that as well but I also

00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,799
empathize with those who want to

00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:29,999
experiment with different models free

00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,039
software exists within a greater

00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:34,999
economic system and until there's a

00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,019
universal basic income for everybody I

00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:39,509
have great sympathy for those who are

00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:41,069
struggling to marry together information

00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:43,829
freedom and software freedom and

00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:45,119
financial security I was just want to

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,650
take a moment to clarify that there's a

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,329
difference between a project choosing

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,640
not to freely licensed software they've

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:52,619
developed and projects taking freely

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,049
licensed software and then using it and

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:56,670
not contributing interchanges back and I

00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:58,079
greatly appreciate the free software

00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,339
Conservancy and people like Karen

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,339
Sandler to try to prevent the ladder

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,710
so I'm in that fog lamp I want to say

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:16,040
it's farm in a way and there are a

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:18,349
number of organizations listed here that

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,660
are trying to experiment so just go over

00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,609
them there's a bunch of paid internships

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,130
and fellowships I post with you before

00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:26,450
but there is something like 16 or 18 of

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,190
them listed on the wiki page if you

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,349
follow one of those links there is

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,970
crowdfunding platforms like snow drift

00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,520
as well as things like to try on

00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,619
IndieGoGo there's a science crowdfunding

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,570
experiment experiment calm which is

00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:40,430
pretty cool grantmaking organizations

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,280
like the knight Foundation sunlight

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,060
foundation Wikimedia Shuttleworth

00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,010
fundraising drives by individual

00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,450
projects there's a ton of these I just

00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,160
kind of shout out the Python Software

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,380
Foundation and Django because there's

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,720
some of my favorites there are companies

00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,910
that sponsor products so for instance

00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,140
the Linux Foundation a bunch of

00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,060
companies fairly recently after

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,609
heartbleed I started to get together to

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,460
support openssl strike the cynical

00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:06,440
different source retweet and this is

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,630
also some sort of like even more

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,819
experimental ways of funding boss for

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,400
instance yesterday at Paige Peterson

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:15,619
talk Peterson's talkin about made safe

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,599
which uses cryptocurrency token stuff on

00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:18,980
their work on this also found resource

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,109
which is like an open source bounty

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,300
system so there are people who are who

00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,320
are really experiment in this space and

00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,220
trying to pin you

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,820
more power to them my fourth and final

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,840
bug report of the day expected behavior

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,340
people of all backgrounds and

00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,130
demographics and using contribute to

00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,470
free software actual behavior free

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,500
software is disproportionately white man

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,510
financially secure and highly educated I

00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,710
don't need to tell you in free software

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,530
is less diverse in the general

00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,680
population and although we know lack

00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,640
good recent data we know that upper

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,400
middle class white men are

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,530
over-represented now I've met people who

00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,960
say they value diversity and you don't

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,790
support diversity initiatives these

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,870
people want to live in a world where we

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,970
interact with each other based on

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,860
interest in skills alone rather than a

00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:10,150
relevant factor is like race gender

00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:13,820
religion orientation and age I

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:16,670
sympathize with this I'm 21 within that

00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,860
world they see this as a pro diversity

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,720
stance that anyone from any demographic

00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,990
and join their project any treated the

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,420
same I'm going to nudists yet another

00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,650
metaphor here I love the metaphors how

00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,930
many people here I've heard about leaky

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:35,180
extraction maybe like a 30 people so

00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:38,600
this is a term was popularized in 2002

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,940
by Joseph L scheme so in software we're

00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,680
constantly trying to extract our code in

00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,900
our design to get rid of unnecessary

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,080
complexity and make things as simple as

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,660
possible a linky abstraction is when

00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,780
that complexity surprisingly seems back

00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:57,200
in I told you you could put any string

00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:01,010
into my search box but you put in like

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,090
say a hyphen into an airline not that

00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,670
this hasn't happened to me within the

00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,230
last week and it shows up as you can

00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,650
can't use that that's a leaky

00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,570
abstraction you told me that you're

00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,560
going to take care of my data and it

00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,580
would be somewhere in the world that I

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,920
shouldn't even think about where in the

00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,089
world

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,170
but it was in a place where there's a

00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:18,359
lot of flooding and the data center

00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:22,260
flooded and my data is gone that is a

00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,540
literal Lincoln distraction according to

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,599
the Polsky Oh non-trivial extractions

00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:30,089
are leaking in some ways people who want

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,470
to treat everybody the same are using an

00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:33,630
abstraction that's leaking all over the

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:36,240
place they want to assume everyone is

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,809
equal but they're not due to systematic

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,430
extermination question you do manage to

00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:43,790
treat everyone the same which is really

00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:47,520
difficult do that unconscious biases

00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,930
you've got trouble upstream now you

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,819
should never assume that a specific

00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,740
member of a marginalized group has had

00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,480
specific experiences but honorable

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,160
people from certain groups tend to

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,960
experience the world differently in

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,040
certain ways and other groups and this

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,670
provides both different vulnerabilities

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,020
and strengths for example someone has

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,430
grown up in poverty might have a much

00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,930
better understanding of how to use

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,150
technology to increase access to

00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,520
government services someone who's

00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,290
socialized female may understand how to

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,240
build a more cooperative productive

00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,770
environment someone who has been the

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,510
victim of interpersonal or state

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:21,290
violence may be quicker to grasp the

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,700
potential the new technology to be used

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,020
someone who's older and made better may

00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,609
be able to better remember the last time

00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,900
a particular trend came around and

00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:30,089
whether it was worth following up on

00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,530
some of these differently-abled may be

00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,710
able to recognize when a design decision

00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,660
red renders a project and accessible to

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,670
portion of users and someone who speaks

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,049
multiple languages may be able to see

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,960
when a concept has not been transitive

00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:44,430
well between the winery's these

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,930
differences of experience are important

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,000
because diversity is not just numbers on

00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,380
a page and diversity work doesn't just

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,390
when you get a certain number of people

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,819
from one to represent

00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,710
to join the project and so this means

00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:57,500
doing the hard work of tackling ongoing

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,420
problems such as for instance lack of

00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,099
childcare and conferences offensive

00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,589
languages in chat rooms and on mailing

00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,119
lists a culture of interruption is just

00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:07,039
professionally silences women and

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,010
non-native speakers I get shot and that

00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,569
last one if you're interested but just

00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,549
as importantly it means providing

00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:15,200
resources of the court people who are

00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:17,359
doing outreach to their own communities

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,490
I'm a huge fan of the work that kind

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,069
require has done in Boston reaching out

00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,960
to people with low income communities

00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:25,250
and showing them about free software and

00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,440
how to use it I want to share something

00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,730
she wrote to me about the disconnection

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,210
often sees when people try to do

00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,039
outreach to those communities the free

00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:37,039
software movement is basically in trench

00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,390
to white European email sorry the free

00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,950
software movement is basically too

00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,779
entrenched in white European male

00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,950
academic culture to do the maximum

00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:44,839
productive outreach to non-traditional

00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:47,630
communities that are less tense the

00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,760
economy the disis this disconnect is

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,890
rooted in large larger societal problems

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,269
around access to education and the long

00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,950
term industrial shift from the blue

00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:57,079
collar to the tech worker as the new

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,250
middle class the solution is where

00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,660
people of color to take up the

00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,430
responsibility to bridge these gaps

00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:04,549
where at all possible to bring the

00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:06,079
technology to these phases unfortunately

00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:08,720
Kendra recently had to live away from

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,039
Boston which is rapidly gentrifying she

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,440
couldn't continue volunteering their

00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,240
time she couldn't find anyone to pay her

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,769
for doing this work however passionate

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,779
she was about bringing peace offering

00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:19,369
these communities conversely I

00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,930
personally got paid to run outreach

00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:24,349
events at colleges like Harvard and

00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,970
Princeton now go garage also runs events

00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,799
at public schools community colleges and

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,150
other places that serve on your

00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:30,349
represented communities and I don't

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,269
think there's anything inherently wrong

00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:34,779
with pandb to run average at Princeton

00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:37,849
it's just in the context of this pattern

00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:38,850
of undervaluing diversity that it's a

00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,700
problem and I want to

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,590
Adam change I'm going to close out this

00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,090
particular bug report by highlighting

00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,320
groups who are doing outreach to

00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,690
underrepresented in marginalized

00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,960
communities I want to encourage all of

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:55,430
you to support these people with your

00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:58,140
voices and if you can with your wallets

00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:00,030
there's another term for the key

00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:05,790
abstractions by the wire and it's called

00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:07,740
intersectionality I was worried when I

00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,440
left this talk that ever come across as

00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,660
too negative too focused on problems and

00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,610
flawless but I remember something I've

00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,200
said many times at era which events to

00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,500
newcomers who are worried about linking

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,290
bug reports they come across it confuses

00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,180
of documentation missing requirement and

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,130
install instructions a broken link and

00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,590
they're worried that leaving a bug

00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:32,160
report will be seen as an insult or a

00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:34,020
demand but they're not proper bug report

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,220
is just an offering they are an active

00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,900
respect and appreciation for a project

00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,610
just as this talk is an offering an act

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,730
of respect and appreciation for the free

00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:46,980
software community as a whole it's an

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,630
act of faith on my part 5 think that

00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,670
this free software community can gain

00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:53,610
wide prints widespread support and

00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:55,650
acceptance think that we can be usable

00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:58,200
and easy to contribute to that we can be

00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,610
diverse and welcoming and if it can find

00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,190
ways to find out to they support each

00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,810
other then we can act in collaboration

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,610
and stand in solidarity with other

00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,860
communities that share our values and

00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,750
then we can be a radiant example of

00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,030
those values leading on leading the way

00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,800
on word it's a hell of a challenge I'll

00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,720
admit it's going to be hard and it will

00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,400
take time and we'll make mistakes that

00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,430
get stuck and have so many disagreements

00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,470
I'm sure but I'm an idealist I think a

00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:25,440
lot of us here I do this and an engineer

00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:27,930
and I challenge like this town just like

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,660
this should make our partisan beneath

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:32,930
the code the heart the radiant singing

00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,930
heart

00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:52,300
also some resources with some things

00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,890
bring us back to the first slide which

00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,890
