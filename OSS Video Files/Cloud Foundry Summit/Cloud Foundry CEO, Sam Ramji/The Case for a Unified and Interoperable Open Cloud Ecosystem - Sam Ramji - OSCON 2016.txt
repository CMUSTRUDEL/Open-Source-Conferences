Publication date: 2016-05-20
Playlist: Cloud Foundry CEO, Sam Ramji
Description: 
	Open source may have won, but without unification and interoperability, the victory could be short-lived. Thereâ€™s a pressing need for an open platform ecosystem. Sam Ramji explains why a platform should come with the expectation of an open and transparent approach. From containers to networking, storage to services, an open platform ecosystem must deliver pluggability as a core aspect of its approach to the data center stack. Sam describes the opportunity for an open cloud ecosystem and explores how transparency enables rapid innovation.
