	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,319
so one of the things that we wanted to

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,879
do this morning was to recognize where

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,910
we're at one of the things we want to do

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,300
this evening is to move into the future

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,309
so we're gonna have a panel right now on

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,599
where we think the ecosystem is going

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,060
what do we need to do to support Cloud

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,250
Foundry and after that we're gonna take

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,910
you wildly in the future with the author

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,060
of the Martian introduced by the Cloud

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,189
Foundry zone Josh McEntee no one better

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
than an ex NASA person and a co-founder

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,950
of OpenStack to be the person bridge

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,989
between our community and in space

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,690
travel so first if we do our jobs right

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,210
we talked this morning about achieving

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,680
ubiquity many cloud foundries everyone

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,920
should have one in fact you can have

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,329
several if they are actually consistent

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,699
if we certify them then you'll get

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,149
portability across each one right so

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,649
many cloud foundries lots of portability

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,590
what we want this to do is enable a

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,420
large safe place for ISVs to build

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,119
brand-new software that can be deployed

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,640
anywhere create a great market for them

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,680
so EMC Documentum is one of the largest

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,229
and most complicated apps that you will

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
see it's a data center application that

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,509
deals with lots of document storage and

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,310
security s ap HANA cloud platform also

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,810
one of the most complicated apps that

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,360
you'll ever find rendering all the

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,009
capabilities of s ap to developers

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,740
through cloud foundry and other services

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,829
so we'll learn from their experience I

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,299
want each of you to think through what

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,150
is this ecosystem going to look like

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,939
when it's not just custom code when it's

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,280
not just all hard work of building every

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,670
single piece yourself but when we've got

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,649
all of these capabilities of ubiquity

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,380
portability in an ecosystem to make your

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,149
job simpler so with that let me ask you

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,369
to please welcome two people first your

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,770
own Ivana Rotterdam the chief technology

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,100
officer of EMC enterprise content

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,100
division

00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,580
thank you very much and under this

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,770
vessel Minh who is the senior vice

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,630
president of sa P products and

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,060
innovation technology thank you very

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,180
much

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,180
[Applause]

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,350
[Music]

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,530
so we were gonna start with having you

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,390
understand a little bit more about what

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,400
your own and Andre has built for their

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,090
organizations so your own I thought we'd

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
start with you

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,750
tell us a little bit about the the

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,560
journey for sure for AEMC for building

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,540
documented anything on that your clicker

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,170
is not working all right I guess here we

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:54,810
go all right okay all right so so we

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,340
started adopting cloud foundry two and a

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,590
half years ago and we wanted to build a

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,660
new multi-tenant platform and what you

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,900
see is that in our business there's a

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,370
lot of disruption going on so we sort of

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,600
see a trend towards really smaller

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,300
development lifecycle so I have to build

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,790
apps and these apps become more targeted

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,530
as well so you see lots and lots of

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,270
applications happening in enterprise

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,690
that have smaller targeted use case and

00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,740
their lifecycle is smaller as well and

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,950
what you see that the date and the

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,440
content is sort of outliving the

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,910
applications and so we wanted to build a

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,530
new platform where we could handle

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,480
multiple applications for multiple

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,850
tenants in a singular environment so

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,420
multiple customers so we built a public

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,640
cloud SAS platform on top of cloud

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,100
foundry but if you drill down into that

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
there are sort of common shared services

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,120
underneath it so we built this micro

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,870
services architecture for our process

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,770
and in our case engine secure certs and

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,090
metadata management and content etc now

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,890
if you want to see sort of the

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,850
disruption I was shooting for there were

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,620
two faults a real disruption in TCO so

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,750
we really wanted to go to Amala where

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,640
the marginal cost to add a new tenant

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,640
into this environment and to spin up a

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,650
new application is really disruptive and

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,609
the second we really wanted to go to a

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,970
hyper agile mode and so to compare it

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:27,120
right so going live from you know an

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,990
18-month project with a team to let them

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,970
on second or changing the way we do

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,440
releases so on the traditional side we

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,350
typically release products every

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,410
of months here we the concept of a

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,060
release is sort of outdated he wanted to

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,360
continue to deploy a new new

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,790
capabilities in the cloud you know at

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,590
any any point in time whether that's a

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,210
batteries or new functionality you just

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,730
pick the latest screen build and you

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,390
push it out and so release anytime is

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,710
super important and you know we went

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,660
from a single tenant environment to a

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,730
multi-tenant environment to disrupt the

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,770
cost significantly one of the things

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,810
that was most impressive about the the

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,430
business ship for you is to say instead

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,780
of having to ship our software into

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,330
these complicated environments all the

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,370
time custom hand-built

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,050
professional services led long

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,490
implementation life cycles how could you

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,880
make the marginal cost of a single

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,380
customer zero yeah you know that's the

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,210
transformational moment right if you can

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,520
tell the business that story then

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,140
they'll get behind you absolutely and

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,330
and in that process we got all

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,310
third-party components as well so that

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,830
you know only when applications are used

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,380
so and compute you know compute storage

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,600
networking resources I used our cost

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,520
will go up and because that you can go

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,320
to really different business models

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,580
where it's all based on consumption

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,960
pricing now when we deploy a foundation

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,850
like I said we adopted it two and half

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,100
years ago were still with VMware before

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,220
we went to two pivotal and an open

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,860
source you want in production on August

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,010
first was here ever since then we push

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,410
in production on a weekly basis we've

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,650
done a few releases in a few days so

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,669
every day I believe but on average were

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,850
on a weekly push right now we found some

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,640
issues so and is this the whole issues

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,360
listed were there more another or more

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,560
yeah so in order to keep it friendly so

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,450
but what's also interesting there was an

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,790
organization impact right so our

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,960
organization was not used to get that

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,210
agility at all so you know there are

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,220
security constraints there were people

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,810
in the program management offices well

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,020
we need to have release define you need

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,750
to have signed off on this right so our

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,700
product managers were not used to this

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,289
frequency of releases that well we need

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,990
to inform our customers and support and

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,560
whatnot

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,570
so it it needs to you need to change

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,810
your organizational office they like you

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,630
go this route beyond the technology

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,480
alright awesome so I can't so Andre

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,500
history just coming off of sapphire

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,010
obviously HANA cloud platform got a

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,880
tremendous amount of attention there I

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,100
thought you might be able to share with

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,990
with all of us a sense of what is it

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,640
what is it that customers are demanding

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:17,170
out of HCP out of Hana that is that led

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,060
you to Cloud Foundry and how are you

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,580
what are your experiences with major

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,680
customers like Siemens yeah I think

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,500
that's a good question because first if

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,800
you hear s ap you might think of okay

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,990
this is stable robust business process

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,480
driven things and why do they need now

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,430
an open cloud platform and just give you

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,670
two examples why that's needed the one

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,440
thing is that you have a demand to

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,140
extend your existing application be it

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,320
on premises obviate cloud and you do not

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,850
want to wait until IT has a budget after

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,160
one year and then run a two years

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,830
project so you just want to have it as

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,680
you go the other big challenge that our

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,900
customers have is you have systems that

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
you still run in the on-premises and you

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,340
have cloud systems and you want to

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,380
integrate them so also there you need an

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,690
open cloud platform to do that and this

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,460
was why we initiated our path which we

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,170
call the the Hana cloud platform there's

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,240
certainly one thing but there is a

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,580
second thing that is a key driving force

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,430
that comes up now very prominently

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,540
that's driven through the whole

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,400
digitization that happens in the

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,470
industry and that is really disrupting

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,720
the industry it's in the machine

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,880
industry it's the sensors you heard even

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,760
about the insurance industry you hear in

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,830
the automotive industry and I think that

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,170
really puts new challenges regarding Big

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,360
Data but also regarding openness and the

00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:40,660
need for an open cloud platform and

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,820
ecosystem there and these are big trends

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,040
where customers are asking us what is

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,810
our answer and coming back to the

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,880
Sapphire what we just announced for

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,280
example last week at the Sapphire at

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,400
Orlando which is our big sales event is

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,490
a partnership together with Siemens as a

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,890
big industry player that are betting and

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,410
building on our open cloud platform

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,779
which includes any Cloud Foundry acids

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,209
as we go so to really build out their

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,920
industry cloud for the future and this

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,990
is certainly a key scenario what

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,640
customers expecting for us so they're

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,829
gonna be building further apps put a

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,990
ship on top of HCP that's the idea is

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:23,019
basically they take the core platform

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,300
that we offer they build out their

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,800
application which they call the industry

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,420
service bus that's basically their

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,339
connection point to the different

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,829
machines that they have to the turbines

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,769
in the wind mills and then all of their

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:37,269
customers are leveraging that and just

00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,790
want to have it and they want to have

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,550
web-based access they want to run that

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,220
within our si P data centers but also

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,690
within their data center so the topic of

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,300
private cloud deployment that

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,940
flexibility that we can run on OpenStack

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,490
that they can add their own services so

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,100
rapid rapid Postgres that's of key

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,450
importance and therefore we decided to

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,279
join the foundation and we are very

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,959
happy and I'm quite happy to see all the

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,420
momentum me and all the people because

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,399
that's kind of a tradition of sa P that

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,079
alone we never ever win it's always

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,120
about partnering and teaming up in the

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,410
ecosystem and to your point one of the

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,300
one of the amazing things about cloud

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,699
foundry is that since everyone can have

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,260
one and they're consistent and portable

00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,880
we're actually have the opportunity to

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,260
really change the software supply chain

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,209
you're actually talking about an

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,470
ecosystem of ecosystems where you can

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,089
start to bring in the providers who

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,339
build on top of sa P or on top of

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,500
documentum which are also being offered

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,209
as the clouds that large industry

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,940
players as software is eating the world

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:35,140
right on each of the major global 2000

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,779
companies becomes a software company

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,519
there are much bigger packages that can

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,589
flow all the way through the system it

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,829
can also be a lot smaller so I guess to

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:46,720
to close I would ask each of you for

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,149
what's your what's your single best sort

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,529
of piece of advice for someone who's

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,930
here or somebody who's watching on the

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,470
livestream who's currently at a big is

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,790
be thinking or even a net new ISP how

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,300
would you guide them to think about

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:05,470
getting onto Cloud Foundry as a business

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,440
platform well you know it's a business

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,050
decision right it's so extremely painful

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,060
to deploy software in a very large-scale

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,589
global enterprise setting right there's

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,890
a nice fee you know if you're offering

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:19,390
it as a service and just focus on the

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,880
business and you'll see lots and lots of

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,980
hurdles right the challenges we have

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,790
with you know our global security office

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,750
for instance our program management

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,579
convincing that developers are actually

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,279
know what they do when they put stuff in

00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:35,050
production but in the end it's a

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,899
business drive it's so easy you're

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,839
you're reducing cost significantly and

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,089
the ideality you get with it it's just

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,880
unbelievable any silver bullets for

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,880
getting through this security review

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,600
yeah you know you just live with it so

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,970
yeah so if you're struggling with your

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,430
security officer give them a haven't

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,190
give you an fun rubberband McCalla he'll

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,050
walk them through the whole process

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,540
under what what guidance would you offer

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,850
is vs were thinking about building on

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,170
cloud foundry in terms of their their

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,029
opportunity and then maybe a little bit

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,300
about what to watch out for if you have

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,769
any any guidance I mean for me the key

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,930
argument also along the lines with the

00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,990
business decision is that if you do not

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,730
have such an open cloud platform you are

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,100
simply not able to stay competitive in

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,529
the market I mean this is why also the

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,600
big industries are coming also to us and

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,860
asking how do you approach that because

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,230
on the one hand side they have the

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,910
industry specific knowledge on the other

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,160
hand side they cannot build out the

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,050
challenges of that big data digitization

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,149
the future without having any platform

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,069
so and that's important to understand

00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,550
it's a combination of both without

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:47,230
having a key open platform available you

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,910
are not competitive in your business

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,000
environment I think that's the main

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,339
driver why a lot of corporate size V is

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,199
looking into that and piggybacking on

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,880
that story yeah so we invite you to

00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,279
explore Cloud Foundry

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,470
as a way to defragment your own

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,120
ecosystem right fragmented ecosystems

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,260
don't grow so well but if we can all

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,180
share each other's

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,680
insight if we can have common

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,750
programming models we can make this a

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,949
much more efficient place to play so

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,709
with that thank you so much for your

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:16,300
leadership and for your time

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:19,980
all right yeah
