Description: 
	The Chief Digital Officer Global Forum will focus exclusively on strategic best practices and facilitate high-touch, engaging debate and discussion about key issues and trends in regards to reaching, engaging, converting, and nurturing long-term customer relationships with the increasingly demanding, and often-elusive, connected consumer.  The Global Forum will discuss the new consumer engagement funnel, rapidly-evolving connected consumer behavior and consumption patterns and trends, insights into the minds of digital consumers, digital marketing best practices, current and emerging content distribution platforms, the state of digital commerce and we'll take-a-peek into the future at our traditional "Postcards From The Edge" closing keynote.
Format

The inaugural Chief Digital Officer Executive Forum will offer a mix of "pre-conference" private sessions for qualified digital operating executives and compelling and engaging keynotes, interviews, and high-caliber panels along with ample networking time and unique off-campus social activities for all attendees of the Executive Forum. Overall, the agenda will be balanced and include sessions focusing on timely, relevant industry trends and issues along with sessions that are designed to stimulate thinking, demand consideration of alternative viewpoints, and help our delegates foster creativity and innovation within their organizations and acquire new leadership and negotiation skills.
