	Cloud Foundry Foundation surges forward | #OpenStack

Formed less than six months ago, the Cloud Foundry Foundation, which controls Pivotal Software, Inc.’s Cloud Foundry, has made much progress in a short amount of time.

“We’re waking up in a world where we care about two things: multivendor and multicloud,” said Cloud Foundry CEO Sam Ramji, who filled in theCUBE cohost John Furrier on Cloud Foundry Foundation’s background during OpenStack Summit 2015. “We should be very concerned about single-vendor open source. A year ago IBM announced that Cloud Foundry was going to be part of Bluemix and moved to create the foundation along with Pivotal. Nine months ago when HP made the same announcement around HP Helion, that’s when the ball really started rolling.”

A big-picture approach

The Cloud computing platform takes a big-picture approach to delivery. “It’s not how fast can you get from A to B; it’s how fast can you turn the entire crank,” said Ramji. “The operators have been left behind. With Cloud Foundry, mature enterprises can say, ‘We have a cycle of innovation, we need to turn that crank every week, and we need to do that in multiple departments.’ This is a system that will let you dev, test, operate, maintain, bring it all the way through the cycle.”

Interested parties can visit GitHub and pull sources down from the Cloud Foundry section. “It’s free, it’s portable, it’s consistent and it ships every month,” concluded Ramji.
